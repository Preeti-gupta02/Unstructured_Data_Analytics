0,0,Sleepin_Dragon,Surprisingly good.,8/10,21 November 2021,"I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see Dan Ackroyd, Bill Murray, and many other faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will appreciate seeing them all here. Paul Rudd was awesome I thought, he stood out for me.

1,1,kosmasp,Ghostbusters the next Generation,9/10,23 November 2021,"I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.That being said this adds a few cool people - namely Paul Rudd and the kids. Especially the daughter and the kid who befriends her (Podcast) are a great team together. Really funny and with great respect to the movies that came before it. Maybe minus the one with the all female cast. Now I personally liked that too - if you didn't enjoy that fair enough, can't compare those two anyway.So much weirdness and comedy that works here, because of the script and because of the actors. And yes many flashbacks still - that even if you don't have the movies fresh in your memory work wonders. Also stay through the credits - one mid credits scene and one after credit scene.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
2,2,CinemaSerf,Good cast but too little story.,6/10,23 November 2021,"""Callie"" (Carrie Coon) is a bit short of cash, so must retreat to her late father's dilapidated pile with her son ""Trevor"" (Finn Wolfhard) and geeky daughter ""Phoebe"" (Mckenna Grace). When the young girl discovers that she has a chess partner that she cannot see, then a ""ghost trap"" under their frequently shaking old house, she and her brother - alongside her seismologist teacher ""Gary Grooberson"" (Paul Rudd) are soon doing what it says on the tin. It takes for ever to get going, this film - far too much time is spent on character development and by the time it actually gets up to speed I was just a little bit bored. It is redeemed by the last ten minutes, to a certain extent, but I could have been doing with a bit more of Rudd's character - and quite a few more ghosts to bust. It looks ok, the effects are fine - there is just a paucity of them - and the two youngsters work well together with a decent (if wordy) script that has some amusing scientist jokes.

3,3,Calicodreamin,Worthy successor,7/10,20 November 2021,"This reboot of sorts did it all right in terms of being respectful to the original, maintaining a plausible storyline, and having awesome cameos. The story was a bit slow to develop but had some cool moments and a lot of small laughs. All of this proudly sponsored by Walmart.

4,4,george.schmidt,Reitman's valentine to the original comedy horror classic will make you feelin' good.,8/10,22 November 2021,"GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE (2021) *** Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O' Connor, Bill Murray, Dany Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, JK Simmons, Olivia Wilde. (voices of : Josh Gad & Shohreh Aghdashloo). Filmmaker Jason Reitman, son of executive producer and director of the original comedy horror classic, returns the franchise true to form in this valentine to the team of paranormal exterminators with the Spengler family retiring to their estranged paterfamilias Egon (the late, great Harold Ramis) where his granddaughter (Grace, in a winning and often uncanny turn as the famed comedian) discovers her grandfather's plans to stop the return of Gozer the Gozarian to return for another shot at destroying the world, while in the process of uniting her family in their new Mid-west environs. Reitman, who co-wrote with Gil Kenan the chock block of Easter eggs screenplay that wisely incorporates its source material with its new cast (the weight of the legacy rests well on the slender yet able shoulders of Grace, the heart of the film). Fun mix of visuals and much welcomed extended cameos make for a heckuva night at the cineplex.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
5,5,neil-476,Great fun,9/10,24 November 2021,"Single mother Callie and kids Trevor, 15, and Phoebe, 12 are evicted just as Callie's estranged Dad dies and leaves them his place, a creepy gothic homestead in an Oklahoma backwater. Trevor gets a job at the local diner, where he can make moon eyes at cute and friendly local waitress Lucky. And scientist prodigy Phoebe connects with teacher and amateur seismologist Gary, keenly researching the inexplicable local earthquakes. She also becomes friendly with Podcast, a kid who makes podcasts about inexplicable scientific phenomena and constantly talks in 3rd party linking sequences. Phoebe discovers a lab in the basement where her grandfather worked. And she discovers that her grandfather was Egon Spengler...I liked the all-female Ghostbusters of several years ago, but that has been put to one side: this movie is effectively Ghostbusters 3 because it follows on in a number of ways from the original movies. The trailer shows us Dan Aykroyd reprising Ray Stantz and Paul Rudd as teacher Gary.But I'm pleased to say that the kids, and in particular Mackenna Grace's Phoebe, carry this film. The story is good, the cast are fine, the script is good fun with some lovely lines, the callbacks are effective, and the film has heart. There has been criticism that the film overdoes its fan service, but I felt this was integrated well into the story (contrast Solo, for instance).",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
6,6,ferguson-6,Dirt Farmer grandkids,7/10,18 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a reason musical acts like The Eagles, Jimmy Buffet, and The Rolling Stones continue to pack arenas. We love our nostalgia and prefer it familiar and easily recognizable. The fans don't show up to hear the new songs, but rather those 'oldies-but-goodies' that bring back pleasant memories. Writer-director Jason Reitman and co-writer Gil Kenan fully understand this psychology as they deliver what amounts to a sequel of the original GHOSTBUSTERS movie released 37 years ago (and directed by Reitman's father Ivan).The hook in this updated version is that Callie (Carrie Coon), the adult daughter of original Ghostbuster Egon Spengler (originally portrayed by the late Harold Ramis), has been evicted from her apartment. She packs up the car and her two kids, and heads to the dilapidated farm house she inherited from the father she never knew. Callie has lived her life bitter and hurt that her father never reached out, choosing instead to isolate himself in Summerville in the ""middle of nowhere"". Her kids are Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), an awkward teenager, and Phoebe (a stellar McKenna Grace), a science whiz who seems to be a near-clone of the grandfather she never met.As they adjust to a new life, Trevor swoons over local girl Lucky (Celeste O'Connor), while Phoebe befriends another outcast self-named Podcast (Logan Kim), and Callie gets closer to Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a Seismologist ""teaching"" summer school with help from some age-inappropriate movies on VHS. As great as Coon and Rudd are (and both are great), the real fun comes from the youngsters exploring grandfather's workshop and the mysterious mountain at the edge of town, which is actually a long ago abandoned mine run by the town's founder.Supporting actors include Bokeem Woodbine, JK Simmons, and Tracy Letts. Many of the elements will seem familiar as the kids begin to uncover the ghostly creatures unlocked thanks to Grandpa Egon's research and tools. As with the original, busting the ghosts is fun, but it's the one-liners and crackling dialogue that make this a joyous ride from beginning to end. A battered Ectomobile (Ecto-1) plays a key role, as do ghost traps, crossing streams, and a new generation of Stay-Puft Marshmallows.Jason Reitman is a two-time Oscar nominee for UP IN THE AIR (2009) and JUNO (2007), but it seems clear his mission here was to provide a fitting tribute to the original film, his father, and the late Harold Ramis. He's assisted along the way with some special effects and even more special appearances, though the missing Rick Moranis is notable (and expected). The original blockbuster spawned sequels, re-boots, toys, an animated series, video games, documentaries, and now ... another sequel (one that mostly disregards everything but the original). There is a Spielberg feel as the scene is small town instead of NYC, and perhaps with this family-friendly focus on the kids, the best comparison might be THE GOONIES. It's nostalgic, yet new and fresh, and we do get a look at Hook and Ladder #8, and the familiar tune of Ray Parker Jr's iconic theme song. Hang on for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes, and just remember to take this for what it is ... a rollicking good time.Opening in theaters on November 19, 2021.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
7,7,blanbrn,Not the 84 original still a sentimental and new era tribute!,7/10,22 November 2021,"Finally watched ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" and I must say it was a decent follow up with some charming and sentimental scenes that brought back memories of old ghosts. As the film centers around and has a connection of the grandson of a past ""Ghostbuster"" and a spooky abandoned farm house left by him. And again ghost are on the prowl and move in on this new era and help and assistance is given from old legends in the end as Murray, Dan, and Ernie make an appearance to fight the evil spirits. And most liked and memorable was the cute and sweet scenes of the little baby marshmallow men who come to life with smores at Wal-Mart in front of Paul Rudd's teacher character I thought that was so sentimental, and had an original legacy feel and a tribute to the classic 84 ""Stay Puft Marshmallow Man""! I loved the mini pufts! Overall this picture is nothing great still it entertained and was interesting with the ghost subject all while the new era characters had past connections to the classic and original ""Ghostbusters"".

8,8,thesar-2,Altered State,4/10,21 November 2021,"Going in, I had zero expectations and I *knew* it had to be better than 2016's Ghostbusters. It merely had to exist to be better than that last tragedy 5 years ago.But, here's the thing: It's barely better than the 2016 atrocity. At least Paul Feig tried to make that movie a comedy. This was absolutely NO comedy.And that's the biggest thing missing here and what made this a far distant entry in the nearly-40-year-old series: jokes. Sure, our lead, Egon's granddaughter, spews decades-old one-liners (which admittedly, were funny) throughout, but that's the extend of 90% of the humor. Naturally, Paul Rudd fills in the remaining 10% with a running 80s horror gag.But, the 1st comedic masterpiece and 1989's comedic follow-up were COMEDIES. Not horror, sci-fi, supernatural...straight up comedies. This 2021 too-late (official) third entry was a drama chock-full of forced nostalgia and repeated scenes from the original. Not only did this make me sad, but it left me feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied.Worst Mother of the Year is all-but completely nonchalant about getting evicted and had her estranged father not just died and left her a DIRT house in the middle of Nowhere, OK, her kids would be homeless. But, lucky for them, they all get to move reluctantly into Small Town USA. Unlucky for them, a repeat of the original 1984's events are right under their feet.There's more to it, like the relationship, or lack thereof, between the terrible mother's father, former Ghostbuster Egon and his daughter/friends and a budding romance between the granddaughter and an eccentric kid who calls himself ""Podcast."" And their relationship, the young blossoming romance, was surprisingly the best part of this movie. The two kids were so cute together and had great chemistry.But, that's also part of the problem. This movie felt like a TV/Streaming episode, like from Stranger Things and overall, incomplete and rushed. As if they were either running out of time, low on budget or both and they just released the first draft. I shouldn't have gone away loving most about a Ghostbusters film: a story of two kids' first love. It should have been about the comedy and the feeling of nostalgia that wasn't forced like it's been for the past decade.Oh, well, again, it's waaaay better than Ghostbusters (2016,) but like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this fourth entry is making me love Ghostbusters II all the more.***Final Thoughts: Recommended for fans of the original. Brand new viewers need to watch the original 2 first, please. Don't watch this and think this was a genuine Ghostbusters movie. This is a love letter, not a sequel.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
9,9,FeastMode,pretty good,6/10,19 November 2021,"Generally well-made movie. Much higher quality than the 2016 comedy version, and a lot more serious, with jokes that feel organic. I was entertained and invested. The two kid actors were the best part of this movie. I don't consider myself a Ghostbusters fan, but I had a good time overall (1 viewing, opening night 11/18/2021)

10,10,ericstevenson,Oddly good,8/10,29 November 2021,"The original film was known for being a classic comedy, but this really wasn't that much of a comedy. It seemed to take itself more seriously than the other ""Ghostbusters"" movies. This movie features the grandchildren of Egon (Harold Reamis) from the first movie finding out who he was in a town in Oklahoma. The movie really works as being particularly heartwarming in the very end. I'm not gonna lie when I say it could have been shorter. It also didn't quite have good pacing.It was really funny to see a bunch of tiny Stay-Puft Marshmellows appear as enemies instead of a giant one. Again, this reminds me of ""Gremlins"" as many movies do. We get some really colorful visuals and exciting scenes. It may lag on, but trust me when I say it's worth your time to watch it to the very end. Nothing can beat the original. While the previous film was ""Ghostbusters with Women"" this was more like ""Ghostbusters with Teenagers""...and it works better. ***

11,11,cricketbat,"It's like fan fiction, but good fan fiction.",7/10,23 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife feels like it was written by a kid who was a fan of the original movie, imagining what it would be like to be a Ghostbuster. It's obvious the creators of this sequel love the first films. It hits all the right notes of nostalgia, so even when it hits a wrong key with a plot point or a joke, you don't really mind because the overall melody is pleasant. It's like fan fiction, but good fan fiction.

This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be.

13,13,cruise01,Fun ghost adventure with new characters and surprises.,7/10,20 November 2021,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a pretty fair supernatural comedy that continues after the original two films. Following decades later, on a single mother Callie (Carrie Coon) and her two children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace). They move into a old farmhouse after there grandfather has passed away and gave them the inheritance. Phoebe and Trevor discovering something hidden in the barn that goes back towards the original ghostbusters. While the town they have been living in has been experiencing earthquakes. And something sinister coming from the mountain in that town. Which Phoebe and Trevor discovering ghosts and gets help from Gary (Paul Rudd) who has been investigating the strange occurrences in the town.What worked? The film is a fresh sequel off from the original two films. It continues the story in a way. And has a lot of easter eggs and surprises that the original fans will love. It does not disappoint without giving much away. From previous characters to supernatural ghosts. It was a lot of fun with the script and direction bringing back and paying homage to the original.Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, and Carrie Coon were good playing new characters. Playing as a family who are forced to live in the farmhouse after struggling with debt and having nowhere to go. Paul Rudd is a fun addition playing Gary Grooberson, a school teacher. A teacher who skimps out on summer classes and just put horror movies on for his class mates. There are other fun cast members that makes surprises which is more fun to see for yourself.The visual effects are pretty decent and exciting. Seeing a ghost called Muncher who is similar to slimer. Plus the hellhounds are back. And more.The film does have some decent action sequences that put the family in a ghost adventure in trying to save the world from a forming apocalypse. The new mini marshmellow puff creatures were fun and entertaining.What did not work?The film does have a slow set up with the first act of the movie. Having the family move into the town. Despising there grandfather for having a weird reputation and falling apart farm house. Phoebe being awkward and trying to fit in at school. Trevor trying to get the girl he met at a burger place and fitting in with that group of friends. Callie falling for Gary Grooberson. Does have a slow moving direction for the first half of the movie. Picks up when the kids get the ghostbuster car and equipment.The second slight issue is the big threat that is set up is too easily resolved in the climax. It brings for a decent action scene but it is quickly resolved which ends abruptly.Overall, it is a pretty fair film and fun addition that will make fans happy to see.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
14,14,DarkVulcan29,R.I.P. Harold Ramis,9/10,29 November 2021,"Feels like a Ghostbusters film with a little Stranger Things mixed in. I'd rather tell you too much about the story, cause I don't want to give too much away, but I gotta say it's a new Ghostbusters film with some feeling of nostalgia. The characters are a joy to watch, and the effects are pretty good also.I admire the film does pay homage To Harold Ramis who passed away in 2014. Who was co writing genius with Dan Aykroyd of the two Ghostbusters film. And a great director of such great comedy classics like Caddyshack(1980) and Groundhog Day(1992). He left quite an impact on the industry, forever a legend Harold Ramis (1944-2014)

15,15,stevendbeard,Tremendous Job,8/10,20 November 2021,"I saw ""Ghostbusters:Afterlife"", starring Mckenna Grace-Young Sheldon_tv, Captain Marvel; Finn Wolfhard-Stranger Things_tv, the It movies; Carrie Coon-the Avengers movies, Gone Girl and Paul Rudd-the Ant_Man movies, Our Idiot Brother.This is a sequel to the first two original Ghostbuster movies from 1984 & 1989, ignoring the 2016 female remake-thank goodness. The original Ghostbusters director was Ivan Reitman and here, it's his son Jason Reitman who does the directing and he does a tremendous job in mixing the old and the new. Carrie plays a single mother of Mckenna & Finn. Carrie has fallen on hard times financially-they are getting evicted from their apartment. It seems like a bit of luck is thrown their way when they inherit a farm from her deceased father-who left her family when she was young, so she barely knew him-but then they uncover secrets that change their lives forever. After settling in to the farm, ghosts start invading the town and causing trouble. Paul plays a local teacher that is curious about the strange earth quakes that have been hitting the town regularly-as well as the ghosts popping up-and he is also interested in Carrie romantically. The original Ghostbusters car makes a comeback, as well as Ernie Hudson, Dan Akyroyd, Bill Murray, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver-there is also a nice tribute to the late Harold Ramis, who passed away in 2014-and there are 2 scenes after the end credits to look for; one as the end credits start and the other is at the very end and both have original cast members in them.It's rated ""PG-13"" for supernatural action and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

New wrinkles include an androgynous kid protagonist, as Phoebe keeps viewers guessing for about 56 minutes, until her mom finally lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak. Though some might quibble that her first name should be a dead giveaway, in this Our Modern 21st Century, viewers cannot simply assume Traditional spellings for the common nouns they hear still apply in the absence of subtitles; ETERNALS provides recent proof for that. Speaking of that comic book flick marvel, this iteration of GHOSTBUSTERS seems to be only about half as long, though in actuality it's just 40 or 45 minutes shorter. However, this movie is better than that visual effects marvel, especially if you send your kids to Sunday School.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

The film only exists to-grossly-re-affirm the alleged values and taste of the original film fans. It has no spark or identity outside of pandering to the base desires of unreasonable personsThis is a mere product. I'm not interested in a product crafted for reactionaries.

Strange earth tremors are being felt and in exploring the property they find pieces of equipment belonging to the original Ghostbusters.

19,19,snoozejonc,Enjoyable tribute to Harold Ramis and the original,7/10,20 November 2021,"After Egon Spengler passes away his daughter and grandchildren inherit his Oklahoma farmhouse.'Ghostbusters Afterlife' is a tribute to the original movie with plenty of charm, but little originality.It will likely depend what you look for in a sequel as to how much enjoyment you could take from this instalment of the franchise. If you are looking for fan service, nostalgia, and a great send-off for the character Egon you will absolutely love it.Every scene that involves Egon's memory or that is connected to him is written with respect and love for Harold Ramis' character. This is for me the best aspect of the film and one scene near the end of the movie is quite emotional.Ramis almost lives and breaths through the character Pheobe played so well by McKenna Grace. She leads the movie wonderfully for large periods and together with Finn Wolfhard's character they look and feel like Egon's grandchildren.What makes the nostalgia cinematic are the props, costumes, vehicle, score and sound effects from the original movie. It is almost like going to a Hollywood studio museum and visiting a special Ghostbusters exhibition because of all the screen time allotted to PKE meters, traps, and various Easter eggs.Entwined with Egon's past is a revisited plot and antagonist from the original movie. This for me is mildly amusing but way too many identical moments from the original are repackaged. It would have been far better to do something new or at least not repeat so much detail.What I loved about the original was the humour centred around the main characters. Bill Murray only had to look a certain way at Ramis or Dan Ackroyd and it made me laugh. 99% of this movie is focussed on the new characters, mainly the children, and it is not as funny. This is not the fault of the actors as they do a good job with the material they have, but there is no substitute for that original chemistry that made it so special. When the surviving members of the original team take centre stage, that is when the magic truly feels to be happening. The best scene in the movie for me comes mid-credits with Sigourney Weaver's cameo.Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd give strong performances, but their roles are largely supportive to the children and serve as contrivances to the plot.Visually it is fantastic, with great cinematography and visual storytelling throughout. A lot of it is reminiscent of Spielberg in the 1980s and this heightens the nostalgia further. The visual effects and ghost horror is both thrilling and spectacular to look at, without being overdone.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
20,20,Pairic,In Good Spirits!,7/10,26 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife: An engaging sequel to the original films. It could have gone in a Stranger Things direction with it's two tweens and two teens or it could have went more into horror territory given it's darker Sumerian Mythos and killer God Gozer (who looks like Alvin Stardust) but that's not the demographic it was after I guess, it wanted to stay with a child friendly rating. We have that old horror film staple - cornfields, invisible ghosts chasing people through the stalks. It's good to see the old ghostmobile (Ecto-1) and weapons in action again, even if the pesky kids lay waste to a town while pursuing a ghost. It's no secret or spoiler (from the trailers and cast list) that the old Ghostbusters will put in an appearance but which one will e a ghost? Good effects and even a few dark scenes but G:A has a strong line of humour running through it. Delighted to see the little mallow ghosts! Directed/Co-written by Jason Reitman. 8/10.

There was no modern political nonsense forced into it which is great for a film as too often they have that nowadays. I thought it was funny as well and in general had great special effects too. The cameos of the original cast were so funny as well. I just really loved this film.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
22,22,aidanratesmovies,Decent follow up to one of my favorite movies,8/10,20 November 2021,"Charming and nostalgic at times, with some cheap gimmicks throughout, Ghostbusters Afterlife is mostly the sequel to the original film that we deserved over the second film in 1989- and is thankfully saved due to its sense of wonder and lively atmosphere. First off I just have to say there are by no means anything I hated about this movie, but a lot of little things I felt certainly could have been better. For instance Finn Wolfhard just doesn't belong in this movie and it shows. His character has no real impact on the story other than driving a car, and his storyline with a possible love interest just feels useless and outdated. Young actor Logan Kim is also just rather annoying to watch throughout, and truly serves no purpose in the film other than to be a retired joke machine for younger members in the audience to laugh at. There are also some cheap mentions and callbacks of nostalgia throughout the film I felt were a bit unnecessary and shallow, although I admit they did put a smile on my face a time or two. Besides all that, I really enjoyed this movie, and i'm not just saying that. The film is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. Its ending is a bit climatic, but it's well worth the price, and honestly made me cry a little. Actress McKenna Grace and Actor Paul Rudd are a perfect fit for the film and exude charisma and charm all the way throughout. The special effects are incredibly well done, especially the CGI and Terror Dog animatronics, and the cinematography is an excellent blend of old and new. It was also quite wonderful to see our iconic characters return to their roles after so many years, and bring the charm we all once knew once again to the big screen. In the end, Ghostbusters Afterlife is nothing particularly remarkable or hilarious like the original- but it certainly shines in many aspects and proves to be quite a delightful follow up for these iconic characters and fans alike.My Rating: 7.8/10.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
23,23,adamjohns-42575,Simply Brilliant!,9/10,24 November 2021,"This is it! This is the long awaited sequel the fans were all waiting for and deserved (What? No, nothing relevant occurred in 2016, let's pretend that whole year never happened), it's what we actually wanted as not some vain attempt to be Politically Correct at the cost of the content.I have to say that It will be difficult to review this one without spoilers, but I will do the best that I can.Firstly I loved the cast, I think that they were all exactly who they needed to be. Paul Rudd is the perfect comedy man, complimented by Podcast and I know I'm obviously in love with Paul, but even walking through the supermarket he made me laugh.McKenna Grace as Phoebe is fantastic, a very talented young lady that will go far, I mean she already has if you look at her back catalogue, but I firmly believe that she is here to stay.I also thought that Logan Kim as Podcast did a great job of embodying a half Corey Feldman/half Data (Ke Huy Quan) character from 'The Goonies' (1985).In fact it's easy to see this film as a mash up of 'The Goonies' and 'Ghostbusters' (1984) with a little 'Jumanji' (1995) thrown in for good measure.I certainly think that, although the lead cast is younger, it will still appeal to the kids of the 80's as well as bring in the newer 'Stranger Things' (2016-) audiences too.The special effects pay homage to the originals. It's not easy to tell if they are CGI or models, which is why it's so good, but they capture the same looks perfectly. I even think the setting was a good idea, New York has been slightly overused for this idea now.I do wonder if the ending somewhat demeans the events of the rest of the film, but I personally loved it regardless.There are plenty of ""Easter Eggs"" and repeated jokes to look out for too, so keep your eyes peeled.Overall I found it to be Joyous, I couldn't help but smile all the way through it. The thought that was put in to it and the consideration to produce a film worthy of the title is apparent. An appropriate and authentic tale to continue and, if the final after credits trailer is ignored, an ending to the fantastic series (2016 didn't happen after all).I would actually love to see it continue, but only if it's done properly. This would be a perfect place to stop it though. We've had our Ghostbusters sequel, now we can petition for the other films we want- Thundercats (Live Action), Beetlejuice 2, Kenobi and all the others.Emotional, funny and thoughtful, a tribute to the fans and others too.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
24,24,masonsaul,Incredibly heartfelt reboot,9/10,19 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an incredibly heartfelt reboot that's extremely heartwarming, emotional and funny whilst treating the original with respect. It also has plenty of satisfying callbacks, even if it's narrative is basically the same as the original.Mckenna Grace gives an incredible lead performance and Paul Rudd, Celeste O'Connor, Logan Kim, Finn Wolfhard and Carrie Coon all give great supporting performances and have strong chemistry.Jason Reitman's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced. The CG is consistently excellent and there's some impressive practical effects too. Both the music by Rob Simonsen and the soundtrack are both really good.

25,25,rgkarim,The Afterlife Party Of The Originals,8/10,19 November 2021,"LIKES:The Acting:
Starting off strong here, the acting of Ghostbusters is not the biggest Oscar worthy, but the young cast steps into the roles of future busters quite well for this reviewer. Wolfhard is a fine addition, but can't say that it was the strongest character for me, yet does provide a little of the awkward fun that we got in the first franchise. His counterpart Celeste O'Connor was a fine addition as well, helping to progress Wolfhard's character to a point in this new age modeling, but there was a little bit more that could have been done. Carrie Coon gets thumbs up as the concerned mom with lots of baggage, a mix of annoying tendencies that get a laugh, and some meaningful character development along the way that was impressive. It's really the two leads for me though in Mckenna Grace and Logan Kim
who win the best acting for me though in regards to new characters. Kim's Podcast is the comedic relief, the 80's style madness in a 2021 package and it works so well for helping with providing that slapstick, vaudeville comedy that we all love. He works well with so many of the cast and is an anchor point for keeping the movie fun and free. Grace though, wow, she was fantastic in her role as Phoebe. Quirky and intelligent to represent another famous Ghostbuster, Grace executes the mannerisms of a social outcast geek perfectly as she tries to learn how to make friends and fit into a new world. And yet, she managed to have comedic presence and emotional spectrum that just made for a great character. It was a fantastic role for me and I loved how much she brings to this role and being the spearhead to really drive the movie to new levels.Paul Rudd:
The ageless man gets a nod of his own, because Paul Rudd is utilized very well in this movie in so many ways. Character developing for the mom is part of the surface, but Rudd's charm and appeal come in just how well he fits into the comedic realm of the Ghostbusters universe. He's a natural and unlike Hemsworth, is utilized in a meaningful way that is not insulting and obscenely stupid, but worthwhile and super fun. His big kid attitude is very welcome to the young cast members, with that sense of wonder and curiosity as he uncovers the realm of ghosts from the past. Then he somehow manages to evolve into the adult role and having a little more serious contribution to the story, eventually becoming a key plot head that is one part nostalgia and one part new. Finally, his comedy just works, a natural presentation, delivery, and timing that had me laughing as he seems to go with the moment and just shine. I loved it and had so much fun with his involvement that he was certainly a strong pillar that I believe many will love.The Soundtrack:
The musical score is going to be familiar, many of the tracks from the past that will have you diving back into the realm of the original movies. It adds to some of my favorite moments, and I loved the quirky tracks trying to lighten the mood, before we dive into the realm of the occult and the dark denizens that play in it. Finally, you can't beat the original Ghostbusters song for me, and thankfully they did not try and let the classic track run free for us to enjoy. A perfect touch for viewers like me and an extra fun factor for me.The Graphics:
The 80s showed the imagination and work done to make the world of paranormal busting come to life and it was gorgeous and impressive at the time. Yet, computers have evolved and the magic they can make is mind blowing to say the least. Ghostbusters Afterlife brings modern technology to the forefront and modernizes the adventure super well to enjoy this new chapter in. You want the goofy visuals of the particle beams while getting as step up in looking like it could be real? They've got you set, alongside some ingenuity for new ways to use the technology that feel very attuned to the younger generation taking the lead in this movie. Ghosts have much more definition to them, and though they still don't quite match the robotic/puppet counterparts that existed in the original, the animation is gorgeous for their use. And as for the other tricks they pull, I'm just amazed by the magic they pulled out in this movie and very happy to see the technology being pulled to the full limits since its creation a few years ago. I can safely say the technology achieves the expectations I had and never felt it intruded upon the classic feel of the Ghostbusters Universe.The Story:
Most of the movie achieves the goals of making a very good story that was entertaining for much of the film. Phoebe's journey to accepting herself is a huge relevant tale to me, and I enjoyed seeing the transitions she had in discovering her place in a world that was struggling to appreciate her. The ghosts helped act as a medium for her to swim through to get to her identity, and provided the ""threat"", but in reality it's really her story and I enjoyed the character development that she held for much of the movie. As the ending arrives, the tale takes a lot of good turns and unleashes that satisfactory, and touching, finale that hit me on all fronts and was certainly the conclusion many of us fans were looking towards.The Nostalgia:
Hands down, the biggest factor of enjoyment for me was the nostalgia this movie holds. My professor and I were pointing out the references throughout the movie, and enjoying indulging in the fun easter eggs that they had crammed into this piece. Props go big and hold the first level of treasure seeking as you search the cluttered rooms, restaurants and canyons for nods to the past. However, die-hard fans are going to find so much of the past embedded into other aspects of the movie, from dialogue and jokes made famous by the original cast years ago, to even plot elements that will definitely please many of the original fans or perhaps piss them off depending on your approach. Still, the traditional elements and fan service are present in this movie, and merged well once more to the newness of the film to please at least one half of the audience.DISLIKES:
The Pace:
A slow opening outside of the initial fifteen minutes, Afterlife takes a little too much time to get into the role of things or humor that the initial film did. All the set up on Phoebe's life is decently done, but it is the lack of the other elements that sort of takes away from the film. The first movie did a great job balancing the ghost busting, the character development/comedy, and the overall obstruction awaiting at the end. This film, not quite as balanced and trying to skirt the fine edge of new to old was accomplished very well, but not quite as smooth as the original film.The Other Story Elements/Utilization of Characters:
Afterlife accomplished much, but the story tried to dip a bit into the new and sort of struggled with utilizing the characters to the full extent. Phoebe and Podcast are indeed the best used characters, with Paul Rudd coming in a close second. However, a lot of the other cast held a lot more to be desired from me in terms of story and inclusion into this universe. The mom's bridge role was very haphazard and incomplete for me, hitting the elements to just cover the bases, but potentially could have offered a little more antagonism and involvement. O'Connor's character had a few cute lines, but her involvement was more of a convenience device or power play, that only brought a few chuckles to Wolfhard's character of Trevor. It's really Trevor's story that does little for me in this film though, and the talent of the Stranger Things' star was not fully utilized as I had expected. Trevor's tale is sort of an accessory of this movie, a means of some forced comedy, with little else to do but drive the car. There was so much more he could have done to assist the crew, but alas, Phoebe's story took precedent over all of the other plots and that was a bit sad to see in my eyes. This also involves the main ghost story, that has those moments of chills and thrills, but lacks a lot of originality, and has a rushed/unnecessary inclusion that again could have done better.The VERICT:
Afterlife for the most part is incredibly fun and has a lot of positives that blows the 2016 version out of the water on many levels for me. Reitman's return to the series managed to blend a lot of old and new together, in a balance that remained entertaining and respectful to the franchise and did not bleed much into politics. Phoebe is the star of the show hands down, and Mckenna Grace continues to impress in her ability to make characters come to life and bring with her a part of the story that hits my heart very much. Comedy wise, Rudd steals the show and even the younger cast mates have great writing to get a chuckle or two out of the group. And as for nostalgia, well, the movie is loaded with it in more good ways than bad, and quite honestly a welcome addition to help distract from some of the limitations of this movie. Afterlife does have some weaker character utilization and plot points, and one plot sort of dominates over the others that the ghostbusting aspects are a bit shorthanded and rushed if I'm being honest. Still, the movie holds a lot of heart and fun, and accomplishes the task of giving us a solid opening for resuming the series that made us sing long ago and enjoy the comedy that stole the show. My scores for this film are:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
26,26,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Ghostbusters: Afterlife,8/10,27 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife has five kid actors carrying on the storied, Ghostbusters legacy. They do a solid job exhibiting spunky fortitude, coming-of-age slant, and some whimsy, Spielbergian moments. It also doesn't hurt to have the original specter fighters show up in the end (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and um, Harold Ramis).""Afterlife"" is a re-bunked sequel done with perspicacity. Gone is the thought of that unnecessary mishap that Melissa McCarthy gave us in 2016. Gone is the staunch overuse of slime a la 1989's Ghostbusters II. Added is a sense of nostalgia and a smack of fuzzy recollection. If you saw Ghostbusters in the theater circa 37 years ago (and I did), ""Afterlife"" will take you back. Rob Simonsen's almost identical film score to Elmer Bernstein's stuff from '84 just adds to it all.Ghostbusters: Afterlife changes its setting to small town Oklahoma. Don't worry. It still feels like a Ghostbusters film and at the same time, ""Afterlife"" is pretty much its own entity. The visual effects are indeed solid and that's saying a lot with a now small budget of $75 million. And oh yeah, there's a couple of car chases too. They're whiz-bang, brisk, and well, on a swivel. Heck, it's good seeing the Ecto-1 being flexed into high gear.As a Super 8ish follow-up that's directed by Jason Reitman (son of original director Ivan Reitman), Ghostbusters: Afterlife supplies tongue-in-cheek humor to smooth over the spooky just like in the original Ghostbusters (I didn't think that was possible here).As for ""Afterlife's"" strongest asset, well it's its first half which has some beautiful build-up. The last act consisting of Gozer, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster sort of copies '84's version scene for scene. Whatev. ""Afterlife"" is still a sound and solid, family film. Bustin' feels good once again.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
27,27,rannynm,Comedy And Nostalgic Moments Mixed With A Journey Filled With Adventure,10/10,21 November 2021,"I like Ghostbusters: Afterlife because it includes a great combination of events from the original 1984 movie. This film has comedy and nostalgic moments mixed with a journey filled with adventure. Then the ending gives the audience a hint of a sequel.This magnificent movie starts off with Egon Spengler in his home located in a creepy, old farm in the middle of nowhere. He is a lonely, old man whose life revolves around how to capture ghosts. After his death, his daughter and single mother of two kids, Callie (Carrie Coon), moves to Spengler's farm. Spengler's granddaughter Phoebe, (Mckenna Grace), is very skeptical of ghosts' existence until she starts experimenting with strange events happening in her bedroom. That's when Phoebe's grandfather's spirit takes her to the Ghostbusters' gun and guides her to assemble it. Her older brother Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) fixes the old Ghostbuster mobile from 1984 and they start their journey to capture this maleficent ghost with the help of Podcast, Phoebe's classmate, and Trevor's girlfriend.This film has amazing graphics and sound effects like. For example, when Phoebe shoots the gun, the light effect coming out of it is very cool. The props look real. I love the use of the Ghostbusters' mobile, which is a huge prop that brings back memories of the original film. The landscape and scenery are mostly outside. The audience can appreciate seeing the town, the green areas and the lonely and creepy farm. I like the costumes, such as when the children wear the 1984 Ghostbuster's uniform, which brings nostalgic memories to older audiences. Bill Murray, Ray Stantz, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts, cast members from 1984, reappear and give this film a sense of excitement and memorabilia. Of course, Slimer, the green friendly ghost, is in this movie. The audience will enjoy some of the 1984 movie puns and also the Ghostbusters original theme song which plays in the credits. My favorite scene is when Phoebe's teacher, Mr. Groobers (Paul Rudd), is in the store and the marshmallows come to life as little Michelin look alike creatures. They are so cute, but at the same time, they destroy everything and start killing each other inside blenders and with torches.The moral of this film is for young people to understand the sacrifices that our parents make for us in order to have a better life. Egon Spengler spent his whole life hunting and catching ghosts in order that his daughter will have a better life. Too bad Callie didn't realize her father's sacrifices until he passed.I give Ghostbusters: Afterlife 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults. It releases in theaters on November 19, 2021. And remember, if you experience paranormal activity, ""Who are you gonna call?"" By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

So, I was bracing myself for this one.The film sees a single mother & her family move to an old house which supposedly belong to her father who was one of the original Ghostbusters from the 1980's. But a series of bizarre goings on force the kids & the towns school teacher to take action & stop whatever supernatural evil is terrorising the town.I found the film to be pretty good, way, way, way, way, WAY better than the 2016 man hating remake which was flat out bad from the start. This film was good, not amazing but good & every cast member was given a fair amount of screen time & action.The effects were ace & the cameos & original cast members, most of them at least, returned & were great. The films story was a bit sci-fi like for my tastes & the film did drag quite a bit at 1 hour & 53 minutes, I though it was too long & could've cut away 20 minutes to keep it lean.Overall, it's a pretty good Ghostbusters Film. Of course the classics of the 1980's will always be better, but in comparison to the man hating 2016 film, this is ace.6/10.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

I'd say that makes it a success. It was nice to see a franchise resurrection that wasn't just a sloppy cash grab or gender swapped for no reason. Here you had a diverse cast without the need to make it a political talking point. Warm hearted and fun.

30,30,hnt_dnl,Not good,2/10,19 November 2021,"The much anticipated GHOSTBUSTERS AFTER LIFE (2021) is a huge disappointment. How can a film led by this talented cast of Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, and McKenna Grace, all of whom I KNOW are good actors and have excelled in other things, be this bad? Can someone tell me the exact point and time when writing in modern films started becoming so cliche and cringe? Opening scene of this movie: The cliche single hardworking yet poor and down on her luck Mom (Coon) with two kids, one a nerdy bookworm (Grace) and of course the other is the dumb, yet cooler one (Wolfhard). The Mom is inexplicably cutting the son's hair because I guess they can't afford a barber. The inexplicable part is not because of the barber, but because for the entirety of the film, the son's hair was shaggy and curly, so what was the point of that scene? The Mom and smart daughter exchange ""witty"" remarks where the Mom bashes her for being a nerdy outcast while the daughter mocks the Mom for being outdated. This was the dialogue throughout the entire movie, nonstop incessant sarcasm! No one talks like these characters, not a single soul in the universe. The cliche continues as of course their landlord is an unintelligible Eastern European chap of the Russian variety who demands the overdue rent. Wow, that's a new one! LolSo the trio of the Mom and 2 kids heads to some country town in the middle of nowhere because it's the Mom's inheritance from her father, the iconic Egon Spengler (the sadly deceased Harold Ramis) from the first 2 Ghostbusters movies. What's even more sad is that this film was in honor of him and I wish it was a lot better because he deserved better than this. The Mom annoyed the hell out of me in this movie because she couldn't stop badmouthing Egon calling him a terrible father and trash the whole time. REAL people don't talk in endless sarcastic quips about their dead parents, but this lady sure did. Each of the trio gets paired off with 3 completely bland, uninteresting, and forgettable characters: the Mom with the summer school science teacher (Rudd), the son with the cliche most popular girl (newcomer Celeste O'Connor) and the daughter with the cliche wisecracking and annoying sidekick (newcomer Logan Kim) whose name was...I kid you not...PODCAST! Who came up with this nonsense?As previously stated, the first and worst problem of this film is the dialogue. It's so awful and is completely unnatural. All of the main characters are various degrees of obnoxious. The Mom can't stop blathering on about how she was a neglected child, the son can't stop slobbering over his overrated crush, the daughter won't stop saying ""science"" things, the teacher won't stop being awkwardly ""charming"", the son's crush just pops up randomly at the most convenient times for no good reason, and the podcast won't shut up. None of the situations feel organic or convincing. The film is just a pastiche of random and boring scenes with the Ghostbusters theme playing in the background half the time. It literally felt like they could have played this music in ANY movie and it wouldn't be less weird.Some other problems I had with the movie are why was the town seemingly full of people at times and other times a ghost town? The night of their first arrival, there were people everywhere. Yet when the son, daughter, and the podcast kid were chasing the munching ghost through town, where were the people in the streets? This is like early evening. No one is just out walking around? The Wal-Mart that the teacher went to only had one person in it...HIM. Where were the staff and other customers at? Why is the parking lot completely empty save for his car? Are the writers telling me that a fully operational Wal-Mart is open with no one working there? How did the son magically become this incredible driver and the daughter and sidekick all of a sudden become experts at operating the proton packs after one practice session where they accidentally destroyed stuff? How did those 4 Ghostbusters suits manage to fit 4 KIDS? Didn't those suits belong to the original quartet who were fully grown men in the 80s? Finally why did no one else in the entire town other than the 6 main characters ever seem to be aware of or care about what was going on while all this mayhem was destroying their community?I gave the extra star for the obvious reason of the climax where franchise vets Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson showed up to save the day as well as the heartwarming and emotional tribute to the great Harold Ramis in that final scene. But everything about this film was just plain awful leading up to that point, so the extra star is all I could afford. I never watched the 2016 female reboot and couldn't care less about it. I only care about the 80s Ghostbusters movies and was hoping to care about this sequel. Looks like the 2 films made in the 80s will remain the only 2 good Ghostbusters movies until further notice.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

32,32,dtucker86,Its been done before and done better,5/10,19 November 2021,"I was a big fan of the first two Ghostbusters as well as the unfairly maligned 2016 reboot which I thought was just as good as the original. This new version had long been delayed due to the pandemic and I had really been looking forward to seeing it. Even though it is an ""all right"" effort I consider it somewhat of a let down. It relies too much on the ""nostalgia"" factor featuring footage of the first film and continuous references to what happened in 1984. They use the ""marshmellow"" man ghost and the green slimer from the original as well as the mother turning into a demon like Sigourney Weaver did talking in a demonic voice about ""Zuel"". The new Ghostbusters team are four kids and I only found two of them likeable. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts (as well as a computer generated version of the late, great Harold Ramis) are also on hand. Its good seeing all of them again but they sure haven't aged well. I look at reboots like this and think it is proof Hollywood is running out of ideas. Anyway, my friends let me give you some advice, if you want to have a good time at the movies rent the original Ghostbusters or the 2016 one.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
33,33,petra_ste,Killer replica,7/10,27 November 2021,"This is a solid soft reboot of the series, which after the 2016 disappointment feels like a breath of fresh air.I enjoyed the characters and the performances; I particularly liked how they addressed the elephant in the room, specifically the fact that, sadly, a full Ghostbusters reunion was no longer possible after the passing of Harold Ramis... so Egon's death and legacy become a crucial plot point. The way this is handled is clever and quite touching.They *really* should have gone with a new big bad though... Gozer and his terror dogs gave me serious First Order / Starkiller Base vibes, like The Force Awakens fanatically mimicking A New Hope. Say what you want of Ghostbusters 2, but at least it tried to do something different and expand the lore with a new villain.It's okay though, a nice passing of the torch. Stay through the end credits.7/10.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
34,34,Anurag-Shetty,Matches up to the 1984 original & its sequel.,8/10,20 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife tells the story of Callie(Carrie Coon), her son Trevor(Finn Wolfhard) & her daughter Phoebe(Mckenna Grace). Callie, Trevor & Phoebe move into a small town. Here, they realize that they are connected to the original Ghostbusters & their grandfather has left behind a big secret.Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an awesome movie. Director Jason Reitman has effortlessly taken over directorial duties from Ivan Reitman, who directed Ghostbusters(1984) & Ghostbusters II(1989). The visual effects are flawless. The adventure set pieces are fantastic. The humor is on point, throughout. There are a couple of scenes that tug at your heartstrings, too. One minor flaw is that the first half of the film, tends to drag a tiny bit. Carrie Coon is excellent as Callie. Paul Rudd is outstanding as Grooberson. Finn Wolfhard is brilliant as Trevor. Mckenna Grace is spectacular as Phoebe. Logan Kim is superb as Podcast. Celeste O'Connor is amazing as Lucky. The supporting cast is effective. The cameos are mind-blowing. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a must watch for fans of the Ghostbusters franchise. 'Who you gonna call?' Definitely these Ghostbusters for a whale of a time!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
35,35,bankofmarquis,The True Successor to the 1984 Film,8/10,24 November 2021,"I am a huge fan of the original, 1984 Bill Murray/Dan Ackroyd/Harold Ramis GHOSTBUSTERS - so much a fan, in fact, that I devoted an entire hour of my podcast, the BANKOFMARQUIS MOVIES PODCAST (which can be found in your favorite Podcast app) last Halloween to this film (Episode #23 to be precise). I found that the next 2 follow-up films - GHOSTBUSTERS 2 and the all-female GHOSTBUSTERS from a few years ago - did not even come close to recapturing the magic of that first film.GHOSTBUSTERS:AFTERLIFE does and is, in my opinion, the true successor to this all-time great film. This is because Afterlife is nothing more than what it pretends to be - a 2 hour homage to the first film and, most importantly, a wonderful tribute and send off to the late Harold Ramis while creating a whole new ""Ghostbusters"" Universe and characters along the way.The plot is fairly simple, the daughter and 2 grandchildren of Original Ghostbuster Egon Spengler (Ramis) arrive at his remote farm after his passing, They start discovering old Ghostbusters equipment (including the Ecto-1) and strange Supernatural events begin to occur.So...who ya' gonna call?This film is lovingly created and produced by Writer/Director Jason Reitman (son of original Ghostbuster Director Ivan Reitman) and it succeeds not because it reveres the first film, but because it loves and respects it and leans into whenever it needs to while also becoming its' own animal.Nothing shows this more than the performances in this film. Previous attempts at revising this series tried to hard to regenerate the unique chemistry of the original Ghostbusters. This film realizes that was a mistake and lets these characters do their own things in their own way.Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon are very good - if somewhat restrained - as the ""adults"" in this film, but it is the kids - that shine. Finn Wolfhard (STRANGER THINGS, IT) is rock solid as Trevor - one of Spengler's Grandkids while Logan Kim as ""Podcast"" one of their friends is also fun and interesting.But, it is the performance of McKenna Grace (THE HANDMAID'S TALE) as Phoebe, the Granddaughter most like the Grandfather, that really catches your attention and holds this film together in a way that is remarkable for one so young. She really is the secret weapon in this film.And, of course, there are some fun cameos - cameos that would be spoilery if mentioned, but you can probably guess.Reitman keeps the action moving along at a fine clip - though the first hour does drag out a bit - and the CGI is much improved since 1984, so that helps things out here as well.More than a nostalgia play, GHOSTBUSTERS:AFTERLIFE is a fun romp that will be enjoyed by those who know (and love) the original as well as those who are coming to it for the first time.Oh...and make sure you stay for the 2 End Credits scene - one comes about 2 minutes in and the other is right at the end, they are both worth staying for.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
36,36,bob-the-movie-man,Nostalgia alone doesn't make a great film,6/10,18 November 2021,"OK, so it wasn't a complete bust (which I feared from watching the trailer, which smacked of ""We tried it with women and that didn't work... now let's try it with kids""!).It sure gets 10/10 on the nostalgia scale, especially with the finale which was a ""cinema moment"" for sure. I think fans of the original films (which I am) will appreciate this effort, although it did a pretty comprehensive retread at times of the original film.The humour for me generated smiles without outright belly laughs. I thought Mckenna Grace did a great job as the young science nerd Phoebe. (Although somebody REALLY should tell Paul Rudd that he should NEVER be in any movie featuring a character called Phoebe. It's like crossing the streams man.)I think the target mid-teen audience for this will love it, and rate it higher.By the way, don't rush off at the end (as 90% of my screening did. There is a ""WHA...WHAT??"" credit, followed by a splendid mid-credits scene.(Full graphical review will be posted shortly on #onemannsmovies.)",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
37,37,kjproulx,A Very Enjoyable Kick of Nostalgia,7/10,19 November 2021,"The original Ghostbusters has been a movie I've enjoyed for quite some time now. It wasn't a movie I ever grew up watching but ended up watching it much later on and still really enjoy it to this day. I'm not too big on Ghostbusters 2, but it has grown on me a little. For these reasons, hearing that they were going to continue the legacy of these two movies with Ghostbusters: Afterlife made me very curious, but I wasn't eagerly awaiting it or anything. I'm very happy that I went out to give it a chance though because it was just a joy. Sure, it feels very familiar at times, but it also does its own thing at the same time. Here's why I believe Ghostbusters: Afterlife should be seen and will please fans and newcomers.Picking up decades after the events of the first two films, Ghostbusters: Afterlife follows Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) as siblings and grandchildren to one of the original characters, Egon. They, along with their mother, move into Egon's house after his passing, inheriting all of his belongings. Stumbling upon certain devices and noticing some new seismic activity in their area, this film pretty much goes from feeling like Stranger Things to feeling just like Ghostbusters did in the 80s. I thought the feel of this film felt very modern, while also having classic moments that felt incredibly nostalgic in a good way. There's a lot of nostalgia on display here but I truly felt that most of it was done in the best way possible. I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this film.Where some people will likely not enjoy this film too much though is how similar it feels to the original film at times. Throughout the third act there are times where it felt like it was repeating the same story beats, but again, I'm just glad it worked for the movie. Yes, it feels familiar, but it also cares about telling its own story for the majority of it. Fans will undoubtedly get a kick out of the finale and some may even tear up, as I did, with how they choose to explore/display certain things. If for nothing else. Ghostbusters: Afterlife absolutely has its heart in the right place.I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Jason Reitman was at the helm as director this time around. Being the son of Ivan Reitman (who directed the first two films), it's very clear, as he has even stated himself, that this was a love letter to his father's work. It very much feels like a new story that just so happens to take place in the Ghostbusters universe. Although he mimics moments from his father's films, it's done tastefully and pays most of these moments off. I never found myself annoyed with the amount of fan service with this movie.Overall, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is too familiar at times to call it a great movie, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I loved watching it from beginning to end. The blend of new and old and even down to the moments where practical effects were utilized, just felt right. I could sit here and complain about how it's basically a remake, reboot, and sequel all at the same time, but I would hate to do that because it's one of the best examples of a movie like that I've seen in a while. It knows it's treading familiar waters and it just runs with it and has a blast doing so. There wasn't a moment where I felt bored or overwhelmed with nostalgia. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the prime example of how to properly bank on nostalgia.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
38,38,jp_91,Good but not amazing!,6/10,19 November 2021,"""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is a good third part that brings nostalgia. The story is entertaining with some scenes that feel forced. The performances are good especially that of Paul Rudd. The cinematography is well done and the special effects do the job. An entertaining film that is totally fan service, every classic element of the original film is present, including the special appearances of the protagonists of the 1984 film, which is appreciated. A good movie but it could have been better.

41,41,lareval,Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!,8/10,19 November 2021,"The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!It is a heartfelt, coherent and fun story that pays respect to its roots and moves forward the saga on a loving way. The plot hasn't been revealed too much because of a key reason and even if someone has been sadly spoiled, when that part occurs in silver screen is just downright marvelous. But not just that peak: the movie has several peaks. The characters were much, much better than I expected thanks to great and compelling performances. Finally we go back to some terror and some suspenseful sequences that harck back to that so damn missed old style from the eighties. The CGI is good, the soundtrack is on point and the script never dragged to me.All in: a pleasent surprise. If the story ends here, it is the best finale they ever could have pulled off. Whatever happens in the future, this movie made its work so right and so enjoyable (with a truly emotional ending in which I cried) and that's all that matters. This is a joyful, emotional throwback call that must be seen!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
42,42,cdcrb,nothing new,6/10,21 November 2021,"27% with a 10 rating is pretty high. Admittedly, i am not the audience for this film, but it is a pandemic and there aren't the usual choices. This film commits the one unforgivable sin of movie making-it's boring. It looks good, the acting is ok, no real complaints. Since you know what's going to happen going in, especially if you saw the trailer, we just sit there waiting for another ""ghost"" to show up. There is a fun thing, but it would only be relevant if you saw the first film, almost 40 years ago. That's a long time. No sale.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
43,43,statuskuo,D.O.A.,3/10,20 November 2021,"As I walked out of a theater, I made eye contact with a bleary eyed fella who just looked at me, smiled through his mask and proclaimed ""It was worth it!""Perhaps his brain was still traumatized by the abortion of which was ""GhostBuster-ette"" which can now be chalked up to a parody film of anything remotely related to this series. In other words, not canon.Look, this movie has its heart in the right place. The only dead Buster is Harold Ramis. So, therefore, one must use his ""afterlife"" as the core of what drives this story. There are massive missing parts. Igon...for intents and purposes, abandoned his daughter to create a massive ghost trap to...make sure the world doesn't come to an end?Okay, cool. But if the movie wants us to believe Spengler has been following his daughter throughout her life, in terms of checking in on her, then he would know her downward spiral of life. And do what he could to prevent this. We know so little about who Igon schtupped and conversely whom Mom here schtupped to get two kids. Eye roll.Poor decisions upon poor decisions. What makes her even more obnoxious is that everything is made to be a joke. His daughter is no mother. She is the quintessentially Gen-X mom who would rather be cool, go to some Lilith Fair concert then to observer her children with any interest. An astute observation from fellow Gen-X director Ivan Reitman's son.Again, the heart is in the right place. But, by the time the story gets to the plot...we will realize we just re-booted the first ""Ghostbusters"" and wish we had seen that one again.All the original actors do their best to shoe-horn their role. Dan Akroyd, unfortunately, carries the heaviest load of re-counting what happened to them after the '89 New York City event. One questions why, after all these supernatural events, how the world doesn't believe that ghosts exist. Made so much more unbearable that Paul Rudd (who seems exhausted from, most definitely, having to come up with clever lines to boost the movie) has to literally say this. Suppose this is a comment on our society of information rich, total ignorant children.McKenna Grace seems to be the center of all this. I loved her in small roles when she was young...er. She had the precocious old person in young body sensibility invented by Dakota Fanning. Here, she is just so dull. The role does call for it. But, I think the misstep is that she should be a side character if she intends on being...emotionless (cutting, here she comes!). I believe nothing of what she says. And less of what she does. She doesn't strike me as a savant of any kind, but they want you to buy that strictly because she is a Spengler. Nope.There is just too much going on here and zero focus. We get nods to the first film and good nature call back jokes. But, they all feel like a sharp elbow to the stomach.Again, I truly believe they meant well and there is nothing wrong with that.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
44,44,PedroPires90,"Good one, best apart from the OG",7/10,21 November 2021,"That's why people don't trust in film critics. Can any sane - or not politically/ideologically motivated - person say that the 2016 reboot is a better film than this one? Exactly on what?Definitely a bit less comedy pieces than I was expecting (even if with much less can be waaaaay funnier that the pathetic unscripted jokes of the 2016 film), but has much more charm than I was expecting. It's a strong origin story for a new chapter on the franchise, being able to be It's own thing, not forgetting at the same time the beauty of what it made it so great.This is without a doubt better than the 2016 version and it's also a better film than Ghostbusters II (maybe less memorable scenes, but still a better film, not so convoluted and much more focused). It's not better than the OG but it's so different that that isn't even a problem. I would like to see one of those huge scenes on the streets, always appropriate for the theme song and for some party, yes. But a film should not be reviewed for what doesn't have. Should be reviewed based on what it is and on that this succeeds.Great new characters - all the kids are 👌, especially Mckenna Grace - but even Paul Rudd can prove that he is still funny and not just a Marvel toy figure -, a different and refreshing location, the best effects, the best ghosts and the best shots in the entire saga (very surprising).For the next one, if we can get a more original plot, one crowd-pleasing scene and a better score (music here is clearly below the franchise average) and keep all the good elements, we are on track for something big.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

The story isn't that deep, but the characters and acting are good as is the setting and the ways they have modernized whilst staying true to the classic. The special effects are good and there are plenty of great little nostalgic moments throughout, as well as a good sense of humour and a little bit of horror.

46,46,ethanbresnett,An absolute blast!,8/10,20 November 2021,"How often do we see a classic/iconic franchise picked up decades later that completely bombs? That takes it one sequel (or numerous sequels) too far? Perhaps too often, but that is absolutely not the case with Ghostbusters: Afterlife. I think this film is the perfect example of how to do a reboot/soft sequel.The involvement of Ivan Reitman as a producer and the fact that Jason Reitman was weaned on Ghostbusters massively helped this project.It has a really engaging and fun plot, full of wonder, excitement, action, humour. It really captures that essence of 80s classics like the original Ghostbusters, Back to the Future etc. Films that are just a joy to watch and that can be enjoyed by all age groups.The cast? Huge tick. I love Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd and they were both great. Finn Wolfhard (who is a tad at risk of being typecast as a teen who can't escape paranormal activity) was solid. McKenna Grace was a very enjoyable lead. Can't argue with the film from this perspective.I also thought this film was genuinely funny, with some great jokes throughout, a few that had the whole movie theatre laughing out loud.Visually I loved this film. It looks great, with the ghosts obviously getting a huge CGI upgrade from their 80s predecessors, and with the visual effects in general looking very solid.From a pacing perspective this film flows really well. It has good amounts of action interspersed throughout and builds towards an epic and touching conclusion.Vastly exceeded my expectations!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
47,47,paulwattriley,A fitting Tribute,8/10,21 November 2021,"This was the tribute that Harold and Ghostbusters deserved, the reboot did not work and it missed the mark.This movie is not perfect and is slow to take off, however its sticks to the old tested formula that worked in the original two movies. There is not a lot of comedy value and I was the only one in the cinema that got the Algebra joke. However what the movie makes up with is the nostalgia and the final 30 minutes a rollercoaster of emotions I had tear of joy and sadness. You could just sense the remaining trio coming back and I wont spoil the rest.Im sure there will be a follow up and would be nice to see some of the others have their kids grandkids included and maybe an adult Oscar the baby from Ghostbuster 2.

49,49,movieman6-413-929510,Ghostbusters for fans of the original and the new generation,5/10,17 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a new sequel in the Ghostbusters film series. This sequel is directed and partly written by Jason Reitman, the director of Juno and Up in the Air. Jason is also the son of Ivan Reitman, the director of the two original Ghostbusters films. He has returned as producer for this sequel.In the film, Callie (Carrie Coon) inherits her late father's farm, with whom she had no real connection. She moves to the farm with her two children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (McKenna Grace). Curious Phoebe finds connections to the original Ghostbusters team among the things her grandfather left behind. Together with her new classmate Podcast (Logan Kim) and the help of her teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd) they are investigating this stuff. During this investigation, they accidentally open the ghost world again, causing the city and the rest of the world to suffer from ghosts again.With this film, Jason Reitman tries to make a respectful sequel to the Ghostbusters film series. Despite trying to please his father and fans of the original Ghostbusters movie with this sequel, he also largely makes the movie in his own way. This film can take some getting used to for fans of the old film, because apart from a few references and equal moments, this film seems to be more of its own separate film. The film retains this status until the final act of the film. Here it becomes a real Ghostbusters movie for the old fans.To fans of the first film, many moments may seem familiar as a simple copy, but with a modern twist. With a bit of a long winded start, to introduce the characters. Ultimately, it can be fun for people to watch this movie with younger family members, to show them a modern version of their childhood movie. Unlike the original film, which seemed more like a horror comedy, this new film feels more like a family thriller.The visual effects have been well updated with modern movie technology making most ghosts seem a bit more believable compared to the CGI used for this in the old movie. Unfortunately, not all effects have been updated equally well, so that you can still clearly see in some ghosts that they were placed in the film with CGI
The comedy can be on the predictable side for older viewers, but entertaining for younger viewers. Paul Rudd comes across as a fan of the original Ghostbusters team with his further sarcastic humor. Fans themselves can find themselves in his character. The younger cast members provide comedic moments for the younger audience. McKenna Grace provides plenty of dry humor while Logan Kim provides smart or clumsy moments.McKenna Grace is best featured in this film as the leader of the new younger Ghostbusters team. Together with Logan Kim, for whom this is only his first acting job in a film, they come across well as team members. Finn Wolfhard, who is more popular thanks to his acting career, is unfortunately less prominent in this film. His character gets less time in this film and is forced into a relationship with Celeste O'Connor her character. The two don't really have a believable chemistry in the movie. Their presence seems a bit forced, so that they have a new Ghostbusters team of four people. Most of the older cast members do a good job. Their characters come across more as extras, as this movie is more about the younger characters. The film also has fun cameos for Ghostbusters fans.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

53,53,namob-43673,"Worst movie of 2021, making the 2016 reboot look like a masterpiece",1/10,19 November 2021,"I could not believe the level of cringe I had all throughout this movie. From a couple of minutes in, until the end my level of cringe was about 100/100, but that was not enough... because during the last 10min my body went into cringe chock and this movie officially become the most cringe movie of all time.Perhaps this is not the worst movie of 2021, some of this is actually fairly competent such as sound design and most of the special effects. Even the base core idea is not bad, and half of the actors are competent. However I do not think I have lived through a worse movie going experience in my life. I remember seeing BvS and leaving the theatre very angry, but that was nothing to this turd. I remember leaving the theatre after watching Endgame feeling empty, angry and cheated by a bloated plot hole of a movie, but again it had absolutely nothing on this urine soaked cringe rag. I saw Batman and Robin, The Last Airbender, Super Mario bros and tons of other movies at the theatre. But not even putting those horrible movies together they can even begin to compete with this heap of absolute garbage.Let me explain a bit why I am trashing this movie and hopefully I can convince some of you to never, ever go see this stinking agonising torture.First of the kids. So we have one young girl, like 11yo, who of course is super smart and outwit everyone. She is the main protagonist and such a horrible actress that she starts at the bottom and it keep going downhill towards the end. Then we have two diversity hired kids, neither of which can act and obviously hired just to fill up quota. The mother of the family is acting like she is in another movie half the time, and like a doorstop the other half. The original team are all in the movie (yes, all of them...) and they did not age well, and when they showed up was the moment my cringe-o-meter broke. The kids can all do pretty much anything, it is like a Mary Sue convention. Nothing, absolutely nothing is funny. They try jokes all the time, but not a single one land. The move makers also missed that the entire original was big joke in itself not meant to take serious, but this... oh lord this... I cannot even comprehend what I saw anymore... my brain is refusing to remember all the nonsense...This is basically a repeat of the first movie, only in a desert, with kids that cannot act with a script written by a 7yo fan of the original. And the last scene/s with everyone gathered and the dead ghost of Egon showing up.. I think I died.. it was so cringe...1/10 and please for all that is holy, stan away from this movie. If you against all my advice go and watch this, have a rusty nail ready to plopp out your eyes and some acid to drop in your ears. I promise you that you will need it.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

55,55,isaacochoterena,Beautiful and surprising ending,7/10,20 November 2021,"This movie is a worthy continuation.Although the story has some conveniences and some script holes, it manages to be at the level of the first two, the story at times becomes slow and sometimes does not have the touch of humor that characterizes the first two, but the third act manages to be endearing, sentimental and very satisfying. The character development is good, the special effects are very good, and the performances are decent.The film manages to move sentimental fibers, just as it is totally worth it, without making spoilers, this film will captivate and move anyone who is familiar with the first two.

56,56,AdrenalinDragon,Ghostbusters Afterfan-service,6/10,18 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the successor film to the franchise we've all been waiting for, and it ends up being kind of a mixed bag. I really liked the first half setting the franchise into today's society and giving the new characters some time to develop and get along with each other. The nods to the original Ghostbusters are not too obnoxious at this poiny and Egon is utilised well in the beginning. The lead granddaughter was perfectly cast for Egon and she did a great job overall, as well as the rest too.Unfortunately, the movie eventually goes in the direction of essentially being a beat-for-beat remake of the original, which ends up making the second half fairly dull. There's almost no surprises and the fanservice-y stuff becomes more irritating and shoehorned in. The film gets lazier and lacks any original bone in its body. There's missed opportunities to utilise the original Ghostbusters team and they do it poorly without satisfaction.By the end I was left with an odd feeling. A feeling that it should have been better and gone in a more ambitious direction than playing it safe and trying to cater to a new audience. I didn't hate it though. In the end, it was worth at least a single watch. Slimer was surprisingly missing, but Stay Puft appears. The visual effects looked decent and the music was similar to the original. Only fans would really get anything out of this, as newcomers would get lost with all the references and callbacks it throws.6/10.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
57,57,sirwillisiv,An enjoyably spooky and nostalgic romp...,7/10,21 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an enjoyably spooky and nostalgic romp that made me smile throughout. I feel weird saying ""nostalgic'' because Ghostbusters is before my time but Afterlife bears that distinctive tone that resonates with me so well. It's that specific type of hokiness that The Goonies, Super 8 and Stranger Things has. Afterlife is drenched in that kind of 80s-esque mood and characterization - despite obviously taking place in the present - and it was like comfort food for me. The story is highly derivative of the first Ghostbusters and takes a while to find its footing in the first half, plus the action isn't as grand in scale. Afterlife is a much smaller, simpler and somewhat pensive film but it's effectively fueled by convincing performances, some pretty decent effects and truckloads of fan service. Several moments had me grinning ear to ear. If I had grown up in the 80s and worshipped Ghostbusters, I probably would've been bawling but for someone who was born in the 90s and didn't watch the first Ghostbusters until my late teens, I still had a lot of fun and was touched by it. After so much inactivity, loss and disservice in the Ghostbusters timeline, Afterlife earns the right to be a straightforward, funny and bittersweet crowd pleaser.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
58,58,collectorofsorts,Best Movie I've Seen All Year!,10/10,27 November 2021,"I watched the first two of these movies when they first came out and have waited over 30 years for the 3rd one. (I'm not counting that dog that came out in 2016) It was definitely worth the wait! It started out a little slow. But picked up fast. We got the backstory of what's happened since the original movies and it came full circle with the 3 remaining Ghostbusters (Harold Ramis {Spengler} died in 2014). I won't give away any spoilers. I'll just say that it's a heck of a watch and would highly recommend it to any fans of the original 2 movies!

59,59,cdjh-81125,A Lot of Fun But Not Without It's Issues,7/10,19 November 2021,"I wouldn't call myself overly nostalgic for the Ghostbusters franchise. I only watched the original film a few weeks ago in preparation for this film and though I definitely enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it's my favourite comedy from that era. I also remember seeing the 2016 version in theatres and while I certainly don't think it was the disaster that many make it out to be, I can't say that I thought it was a good film. All I wanted from Afterlife was a fun time and despite some issues I had with it I can say it did deliver that for me.I think the best thing about this film are it's central characters, I found them all to be extremely likeable and all the actors turned in solid performances. McKenna Grace easily stood out here as the films lead, she had great comedic timing and also managed to bring a good amount of emotion to the scenes that needed it. Paul Rudd fit into this universe perfectly and his ability to play of other actors comedically was put to great use here especially in his scenes with Grace and Carrie Coon who I also felt did a great job and I honestly wanted to see more from that character. Finn Wolfhard was also really solid but I do feel as though he got forgotten about for a large portion of the second act. The family dynamic as a whole was very well done and I think the film did a great job of starting out in a way that allowed me to sympathise with them from the get go.As I said I think the film as a whole was a lot of fun. I liked all the ghost fighting scenes and I think Director Ivan Reitman approached them in appropriately different ways than the original. The humour also really worked for me and I found myself bursting out laughing repeatedly as did the rest of my theatre. The film was also surprisingly emotional in a lot of ways especially in the third act when all of the conflicts come to ahead. However I do think the film ends a bit too abruptly for its own good. I just felt that it could've benefited from an extra 5 or so minutes of wrap up between the characters as some elements felt a bit too open ended as a result.The abrupt ending also didn't help when it comes to the return of the original cast. While I felt all the original actors did great jobs with their brief appearances I do think they could've had more to do. Without getting into spoilers they are introduced very late into the third act and only get a few minutes of screen time together before the film ends. I certainly didn't expect them to play big roles in the film and I understand that this isn't really their story but I just think the film as whole would've benefited from having them be introduced earlier. I think the way in which the third act plays out would've easily allowed for them to play bigger roles and I think it would've been a bit more fulfilling to see them have more to do. The appearance is mostly good but I don't think it would've been difficult to make it better than it ended up being.In addition you my issues with the climax I also think the film suffers from some pacing issues. The threat that the characters face requires a lot of expositional scenes and dialogue to set up and after a while it did cause the film too drag in places for me. One of my biggest pros with the original was how quickly it got to the point and I didn't feel as if my time was being wasted while watching that film, here I think it takes a little bit too long to get going. There were also a few subplots that I didn't find particularly interesting. The plot that Wolfhard's character is given felt fairly stereotypical and also ended up feeling like an after thought by the time the film concluded. I thought Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon had good chemistry but their budding romance kind off fizzled out after a while and the abrupt ending didn't really provided much of a conclusion to it either.I'm probably not the key demographic for this film but for what it was I definitely enjoyed Ghostbusters: Afterlife overall. It's a lot of fun with really likeable central characters with a great sense of humour and comedic timing. I do think the appearance by the original cast could've been done better but it certainly wasn't without its merits. There are some pacing issues and added on baggage but in the end the film is what it sets out to be; very enjoyable and a love letter to the original film.7.7/10 - B+ (Solid)",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

61,61,theredsky,Ghostbusters: Afterlife Review,6/10,28 November 2021,"I definitely really liked parts of it but as a whole, it has a lot of issues. I normally have issues with films having too much focus on nostalgia and I do have that issue here but it does it better than others. For the first two acts, the nostalgia is way too overbearing but for the final act, it feels tasteful and justified. The story and pacing here are just kind of average, they once again rely on nostalgia from the 1st film while adding more information to it to make it more interesting but the story just isn't as memorable. The comedy here is all over the place, sometimes it's really funny and sometimes it's worse than Marvel humor. The music here is incredibly forgettable which is really only something you notice about a day after watching the movie but I don't remember any single piece of music here. Jason Reitman's direction though feels refreshing. It's not similar to his father's direction from the first two but it isn't so dissimilar. The performances here are pretty good. Most of my enjoyment from this film comes from the third act and it's a GREAT third act. All of the nostalgic beats hit perfectly and the emotion here is amazing. The third act is all spoilers but I definitely recommend checking it out for the final act alone. If you are a Ghostbusters fan, then you'll definitely get something out of this.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
62,62,evans-j34,Not wowed but not disappointed either 6.5,6/10,19 November 2021,"I give this a 6.5 obviously as a 80s child the originals were huge to me. Here the story is really trying to replicate the original rather than go for a New Baddy.. on the fence whether this was right move or not, or just trying to play on our nostalgia. First I will give the Pros, the young grand daughter look a like of Egon played her part well acting was great, the gate keeper/master looked just like original Goza wasnt bad either. This also was clearly a tribute to the late deceased actor who played Egon and here is where it gets u and pulls at those childhood heart strings ( Tears😥), it was great to see the original cast again , Winston looks amazing.Now the cons... If that was suppose to be slimer?? They should not have done that he should've been brought back looking exactly the same lil green dude he always was HES A ICON!! If you went with Goza you should've kept her eyes Red like the original. Also I don't think those traps would've done anything to the demi god dogs, they were designed for Ghosts.. Goza was a god so I think maybe they had it 2 easy this time round and cute to bring bk the marshmallow men but all the little ones should've eventually formed together in my opinion to be the 60 footer. I think the film has tried to play on our love of the original and theyve done some parts well and not over used cgi theyve tried to keep it retro, but there's the feeling of it feeling flat in places though there should've been something more or deeper. Its worth a watch though if just once.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

67,67,emryse,It Spoke to the Inner Fanboy in Me,7/10,23 November 2021,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. When I was younger I watched a recorded version of the original ghostbusters practically on loop, sometimes multiple times a day, so needless to say I was a fan of the film, however I watched the second film a couple of years ago and was underwhelmed, then a while after that I saw the 2016 reboot which I can't stress enough is terrible. I saw online that this one was worse reviewed than the 2016 version and almost decided to just miss out on this film all together but I decided on watching it and boy am I glad I did. This film whisked me right back to the giddy feeling I would get from watching the original and while I can acknowledge it has some flaws, on leaving the cinema I was giving this film an 8/10, after thinking more about it and watching some stuff online I've lowered that score to a 7 but it is honestly one of, if not my favourite, film of the year so far.The film serves primarily as fan service with almost everything being a series of call backs and acknowledgments to the original and while I understand this may turn some people off I didn't really care, the film just spoke to the inner fan boy in me. The jokes aren't as funny as the original and while this film is supposed to be dirty and grimy it still feels cleaner than the original, not achieving that lived in look the first captured so well, still I prefer the cinematography in this one and they do try to make the film feel similar to the original in spirit, going as far as using puppets, something you never see in blockbusters anymore and this goes lengths in making the film feel like it's set in the same world as the original. The plot has a few minor errors and I felt the returning cast members were under utilized but still, if you watch this film and were a fan of the original you'll probably get something from it, if not a fan of the original you'll be seeing something better than the 2016 reboot but you won't be able to really get the magic that comes from watching the original and then seeing the call backs and references in this one.A high 7/10.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

69,69,CountVladDracula,A much better film than the 2016 film,9/10,21 November 2021,"Warning: There will be spoilers here.I saw Ghostbusters Afterlife a few hours ago and ...I liked it. It was not perfect but I liked it very much. I do think it is far superior to Ghostbusters: Answer the Call (2016) but I would say it may be as good as Ghostbusters 2 (which I know is disliked by a lot of people but I was about seven-years-old when it came out and loved it).Spoiler territory from here on:
This is definitely the sweetest and most heartfelt Ghostbusters film. The main premise is already known. Egon Spangler has died. The opening scene is very blatantly his death even though his face is kept hidden. He is actually killed by a ghost when his elaborate trap fails. He hides a full ghosttrap under the florboards and then sits down to wait to die. It's probably the darkest and most gloomy Ghostbusters opening but it felt necessary.His daughter (they never actually reveal who had a child with Egon or if he grew her in a test tube or what) and her two children, Pheobe and Trevor move to his old farm. There is some family resentment because Egon's daughter thought he abandoned them. It turns out he was trying to protect them and the world by preventing the return of Gozer.My one complaint about the movie is that we are told that Egon took a bunch of Ghostbusters gear and abandoned the rest of the Ghostbusters team years earlier after he had ranted that the end was nigh and they didn't believe him. This is the part that bothers me. With what we know of their dynamic, after all they had been through- why would his fellow Ghostbusters not believe him? That part doesn't make sense.The claims that the film is full of fan service are true. And yes, it is Nostalgia baiting. But so what? Why is this so terrible? Why is this frowned upon? It's the third film in the original Ghostbusters continuity. If there were no call backs or references to the previous films it wouldn't have a reason to exist.Yes, it does need the previous original Ghostbusters movies ""as a crutch"" but that is because this is a sequel, it is a passing of the torch movie and it is a good one.The one character that out-shines all the others is Phoebe, the implied (never actually stated) autistic granddaughter of Egon Spangler. She's pretty much the main protagonist. They did excellent casting with her. She even resembles Harold Ramis and not just because she has the same glasses. There were times this film was emotionally difficult to watch because Egon had always been my favorite Ghostbuster. He is who inspired me to study parapsychology into my adulthood. I grew up watching the movies and The Real Ghostbusters animated series and even Extreme Ghostbusters. And yes, this film puts the 2016 film to shame. I wish there had been a character like Phoebe when I had been a little girl. She reminds me a lot of me as a little girl except I was never an atheistic skeptic as she started out as. But once she loses that skepticism she really embraces her Spangler-heritage.This film has a lot of heart. There are times where it feels they might be afraid to stray from the lore established in the first film- I would like to have seen something truly creative done with the mythology or ghosts. Muncher is very clearly Slimer 2.0. But what they use from the original lore is very well-handled (save for the original team having not believed Egon).Toward the end you see Egon's ghost (who was a presence through the movie). He is silent but helpful and it's a very well done special effect and it is implied he is at peace and able to move on when the story is done after reconciling and being embraced by his estranged daughter. It was very sweet.The original team do make an appearance right when they are most needed and there are two bonus scenes. I would like to believe Janine is the grandmother but there is nothing to suggest this other than the subtle implication that yes, she and Egon had been a couple.I very much appreciate that the original theme (and not a cover) plays at the start of the end credits. This was followed by a song called Haunted House and to my surprise it was sung by Phoebe's actress.It was nice to see that Winston had become the most successful of the group and was financially supporting the others. It was almost as good as him having become an Egyptologist in the video games. I'd like to pretend both are true, thus successfully (and justifiably) over-compensating for people thinking of him as a token character.Paul Rudd's character, Grooberson, was very likable. I do sort of wish Egon's daughter was more fleshed out. The granddaughter, Phoeobe, is well developed but the mother, not-so-much. Her boredom and out-right resentment of science actually made it difficult to understand why she and Grooberson seemed to be attracted to each other. They could have done a better job to suggest that she actually did have a love of science, herself, but repressed it because of her resentment of her father not being there for them. I think that was what they were trying for.But for all the film's flaws it was actually an exceptionally good movie. I think of it as being on par with Ghostbusters 2 (which I did not hate as some fans do). And definitely far superior to Ghostbusters 2016 AKA Ghostbusters: Answer the Call.I think some of the negative reviews for the film are criticizing it for the wrong reasons- as if nostalgia is something vulgar and offensive. I also think some people don't want to admit that the 2016 film wasn't really all that good and want to pretend that this couldn't possibly be better (though it really, really was).I honestly loved this movie. I thought it was sweet. It's flawed but sweet. I would like to know who was the mother of Egon's daughter. Does she have a mother? Was it Janine? And I am still bothered that the original Ghostbusters team did not believe Egon's warnings. That feels out of character for them. But at least they apologize to him toward the end for it. It's a sweet film and it is very respectful to the original movies.Some people have suggested that the second film in the Ghostbusters franchise is being ignored. This is not necessarily true. Ray's bookstore exists and that was only established in the second film (not the first). Also they said that there hadn't been any ghost sightings in New York in nearly thirty years. Thirty years is closer to the second film than the first. The first film was thirty-eight-years-ago, not thirty. The second film was thirty-two-years-ago. Also one of the bonus scenes reveals that Peter and Dana are married, which was established in the second film's closing scene.This is a good film and I think fans of the original Ghostbusters are likely to love it.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
70,70,andyajoflaherty,Don't be yourself...,7/10,25 November 2021,"I'm somewhat in 2 minds about this film. While watching it, the young kid Ghostbuster fan in me loved every second of it, but then another part of me was aware of the almost overwhelming amount of nostalgia going on in it. The real question is, nostalgia aside, does it work as a film on its own? And the answer is.... partly. For me, the film feels like a gigantic apology for the 2016 reboot, and is basically riffing on the first GB film to almost a fault. Music cues, camera angles, how scenes play out... it starts getting to a point where you wonder if the film is ever going to bring any of its own ideas to the table. And, tbh, a few cool things aside it never really does. It plays it safe. It knows that fans of the 1984 film will have fun with it, but I don't know if any newcomers will be impressed. There's an exchange between the mother and daughter main characters, where they say to each other ""don't be yourself"". Funny that the main problem is the film itself doesn't really have it's own identity. Irony at its finest.

71,71,chris_rowe-881-168820,Awesome. Exactly what a movie should be,10/10,23 November 2021,"I find the reviews on here amazing, 1-3/10 reviews clearly have no soul, saying things like it wasn't a GB film, it's not got XY or Z from the originals, blah blah, they seem to think they're experts on here like they could make every movie into a masterpiece when I bet they have less followers online than their score out of 10.The film is quirky, funny and the lead was phenomenal, I'd seen her in young Sheldon and think that's why she got the job, it was so damn good her performance also wrote one of the songs!!! Talented girl.It was cast perfectly, cgi was great and the tribute was moving, they tease a sequel and I hood they include this cast as I think it would be an absolute gem.I really didn't enjoy the all female version, mainly because it was more making a point than making a good movie, I also hope they revisit that and focus on a great film as this franchise has sooo much potential.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
72,72,gabethedinosaur,The ghostbusters are back again after 37 years,10/10,19 November 2021,I absolutely loved ghostbusters afterlife . It was so well done . It was so cool seeing the old casts of ghostbusters. But it's still sad that Harold Ramis didn't get to see the movie this year . But I'll always appreciate him for creating such a fantastic movie about ghost hunting and making the 80s more exciting. I'm glade my mom introduced me to ghostbusters 1984 . I absolutely loved it. The acting and storytelling was so well done and really hilarious. Ghostbusters welcome home and I'll never forget how incredible and fantastic ghostbusters will be .I ain't afraid of no ghost.,Ghostbusters: Afterlife
73,73,bosscain,Best movie of the year!,10/10,28 November 2021,"For a person that saw the original in the theater when it first came out, I'm very pleased at how this movie turned out. Very true to the original story line without sacrificing or pandering to social groups. This proves that in today's world a good movie can still be made from when the original source material is over 35 years old.

75,75,garethvk,Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year,9/10,16 November 2021,"Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.While a successful video game and merchandise line kept the franchise alive; the 2016 reboot with an all-female team failed to capture the magic at the box office and again put the franchise's cinematic future in question.Thankfully after several delays due to the Covid 19 Pandemic; ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" has arrived and is the worthy sequel that does justice to the original film and sets the stage well for future cinematic exploits.The film follows a down on her luck mother named Callie )Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard); and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), as they are forced to move to a dilapidated farm in rural Oklahoma following the passing of Callie's estranged father and her subsequent eviction.A series of unexplained earthquakes clues the smart and precocious Phoebe that something is up and with her new friend Podcast (Logan Kim), and teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd); help her uncover her connection to the original Ghostbusters and the abundance and significance of the gear that her Grandfather has left on the farm.Things soon take a turn for the worse and despite skeptical locals and the emerging danger, Phoebe, Trevor, and their friends have to battle the forces of evil to save the world.The movie takes its time getting to the action and spends plenty of time establishing the characters, their motivations, and their relationships with one another. There are abundant homages to the original film; some of which are very subtle and clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked on.The film also does not rely on the FX to tell the tale as while there are some solid effects in the film; this is a character-driven tale and the new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout the film.Director Jason Reitman; son of the Director of the original film; clearly knows and loves the material as he not only helped craft the story but deftly weaves a new tale into the franchise which also fits well with the first film and does not attempt to reboot but rather continue the franchise.There are two extra scenes in the credits that you will not want to miss as not only are they great fun; but also tease of future adventures to come.The film also has a few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion from the audience at our Press Screening and helped establish ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" as not only a winning entry into the series but also one of the most enjoyable films of the year.4.5 stars out of 5.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

77,77,Benslie,Doesn't rely on nostalgia but the story is still weak,6/10,21 November 2021,"The biggest reason why this movie just didn't fully make an impact for me was because of the story and how odd it was. The story in this movie at times feels like an actual, ""Ghostbusters"" movie but other times it feels disconnected. For a good chunk of this movie, I was bored while watching because nothing interesting was happening. This movie never fully feels like a proper Ghostbusters movie till the last hour of it. This also connects to the pacing of this movie and how painfully slow it felt. When I said I found myself getting bored while watching I meant it. I get that there needs to be a build-up to the climax but to me, the rising action never happened until half an hour into the movie. I probably wouldn't have noticed these issues if the acting in the movie was good and honestly, I feel like this wasn't everybody's best work. The only person that I felt was actually giving it her best was Mckenna Grace. I don't want to hate on the writing for this movie but it definitely could've been better especially on the humour side of things. The jokes in this movie will for sure work for most but will be a miss for others like me. But overall, the writing in this movie was just cringy at certain points. On the bright side of things, the CGI In this movie was pretty well done and I really enjoyed the new looks for the ghosts. In the end, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is going to work more for certain people and will be a miss for others. I just wish the story was a bit more focused and then this movie might've worked for me.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
78,78,ha77y73ad97,An updated Ghost story for the next generation of busters,8/10,29 November 2021,"Seeing the trailers and the Reitman name attached to this movie i was excited! Being to young to know the original releases of either GB or GB2 and having to die during the 2015 gender swap retelling of the same story this film hits it out the park with tone, new characters and the story to continue on from GB2.Whats not to like about Paul Rudd, taking the Sigourney Weaver love interest of the family, he plays himself and is just loveable for it. Helps Mckenna Grace's Phoebe accept who she is and to love science no matter what! Again She is perfect for the adorable teen with an inquisitive mind after moving to find out her grandfather was and always will be a ghostbuster. Just pushing the limits of searching and her technical knowhow was just fun to watch. Finn Wolfhard as always, bit of a jerk as the older brother but for this movie the nail was certainly hit. Logan Kim was one i really wasnt sure of during the opening moments of the movie through he was going to ruin it was millennial jokes and non stop talking but in the end i learnt to love him whilst busting ghosts!As for the story this fits so well to where GB2 leaves us with the old team splitting and the new generation picking up the touch. There are certainly a few jump scares and moment that are really refreshing but also leaning hard on what made the first one so good. Puppets, Older CGI tricks and jokes that you've heard a million times but i cant hate! This wrapped a trilogy up as well as any that can be done in a horror thriller comedy. The story is weaker than before, the call backs are subtle and not every jokes lands but this was never intended to be an Oscar winning movie but a passion project love letter from a son to his dad in what making a movie should all be about having fun!Lets not forget some returning moments throughout this and when you hear that tune at the end you will certainly know who to call!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
79,79,arod_85,Nostalgic fun!,7/10,27 November 2021,"The movie felt like it's predecessors, cheesy (in a good way), fun, funny, with just enough creepy scenes to keep from turning into a kid's movie. I think they did a wonderful job of paying homage to the original movie. Paul was hilarious as always and the children were great actors, although I wish everyone would have responded with a little more fear of actually seeing ghosts to make it a little more realistic. Overall, a job well done.

Even has the nostalgia factor for the fans. Afterlife is the perfect movie to bring back the franchise after the failed attempt in 2016. The cast was perfect. Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon made me smile everytime they were on screen. Finn Wolfhard and McKenna Grace exceeded my expectations as well. I had so much fun watching this movie.

The magic is not there. If you compare adults who are claiming ghosts to kids claiming ghosts ----You already lost the ""Magic"" the original film had. Then you take us out of the entire environment of the original ---from big city N. Y. to a no nothing town where everyone knows your name. The female version that came out a few years ago is a better movie than this. Can't stress enough how they had no ""plan"" for the story so they stole A LOT from the original film. Man,did you guys screw up -shame all around. And it just got more repetitive and dumber as it goes on. Why?????? Just why? See the Maya Rudoph one again, you''ll be happier for doing so. (and I was pissed off when that came out --turns out it's better than this) How can Aykroyd and Murray sign off on this, they are certifiably insane in real life (which is a good thing) and this is a boring kids ghostbusters flick. 5 out of 10 stars. I guess if your a kid you'll like this but if you've seen the original in theaters then nope - sorry.

83,83,jcooloti,Wannabe Spielberg makes GB for kids.,5/10,23 November 2021,"It's watchable. It might even make you smirk at times. This is a cash grab... nothing terribly original here. They recycle the whole Gozer mythos, this time with lovable children discovering all those great Ghostbusters gadgets.The biggest difference here is the pacing and comedy. The original ghostbusters has one of the best comedy scripts of all time and the editing is AMAZING, perfectly slamming us with great laughs and awesome tunes... but this one is a slow unraveling with a bunch of not funny jokes for kids... top it off with some tear jerking...Whatever. It didn't even feel that nostalgic to me.Btw, Ghostbusters (1984) is my favorite comedy maybe of all time. If you want to see a good sequel, check out Ghostbusters 2 (1989). It gets a bad rap for some reason, but it's actually quite good and very funny. Nothing beats the original sure, but still, it's great as far as sequels go.Maybe Ghostbusters: Afterlife would have been better if I were high... but I don't do drugs anymore. I wasn't terribly impressed. I didn't dig the change in tone. I still like Paul Rudd though. That man is a very likable actor.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

85,85,dan_slentz,Not the original.. but fun and worth watching.,6/10,21 November 2021,"This review is from Reel Tunez, The Radio Show ALl About the Movies.I enjoyed this movie and there are some fun surprises, but it still didn't approach the original. For those of us who saw the original, it really is a trip down memory lane. For new audiences, it really can stand on its own.Most often, movies never hit the level of their most successful movie (the REASON to even make reboots). I will say that it was fun and worth watching, but ""down-size your expectations"" from the original and you'll probably enjoy this more.There are some real touching moments in the movie as well (with Harold Ramis now having been gone for 7 years). This shouldn't come as a spoiler, but you will see some familiar faces.Warning!! Do NOT leave and wait until AFTER ALL the credits have rolled!!! If you've seen Jingle All the Way or any of the Marvel movies, you have come to expect more. There is a fun cameo and ""reboot"" of an original scene in the middle of the credits (funny!!).. and an entire full scene AFTER the very last of all the credits (and right before they turn on the lights to clean the auditorium)!I'd give this new Ghostbusters a 6.5 out of 10. That's respectable, but not ""a classic"" (or future classic). One or two ""boo!"" moments.. and nothing that you probably couldn't take younger kids to see (6 and over). Mini Stay Puff guys are pretty cute too.Ghostbusters Afterlife... worth seeing at the theater. Pretty decent and fun movie!",Ghostbusters: Afterlife
86,86,ThatMonkey,Captured the Spirit! (No pun intended),7/10,24 November 2021,"This movie was good, I repeat good, not great. This film took way too long to get the stony going and the audience on board, If you thought the trailer painted the picture of a sloe movie, you are correct.Even when the movie gets started, what's gets presented is kinda weak. The story lacks heart and is more about the memory of the 84 event than actually busting ghosts.It is far better than the original sequel and the female reboot, but it's pacing is just too slow.

89,89,lakings97,Better than the ladies ghostbuster,8/10,21 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is not a remake but rather the proper sequel that should have been created rather than the Ghostbusters with the ladies. Ivan Reitman who directed the original movie produced this one but his son Jason was the one who directed this one. This one was respective to the original with tribute to Egon originally played by Harold Ramis where the story surrounds his daughter (Carrie Coon) and grandkids (McKenna Grace and Finn Wolfhard) who move from NY to Summerville, Oklahoma to try to salvage Egon's dirt farm not knowing about his past and how famous he used to be. Paul Rudd plays a seismologist and a summer school teacher who wants to find out why the city was rumbling on a daily basis when there was no fault line underneath the city. The storyline comes back around to the original where the Keymaster and Gatekeeper are reintroduced to bring Gozer back to life. The original cast with Dan Akroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson have a brief cameo to reunite to help defeat Gozer. Overall it was emotional, funny, sarcastic and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this one it wasn't very nostalgic but very much worth your time.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

92,92,pressboard,Ghostbusters Resurrected - Yeah!!,10/10,21 November 2021,"I thought the last movie put the nail in the coffin for this series. I thought the producers would abandon the franchise completely. Thankfully, I was wrong! Thanks to a bang-up cast and good writing this outing is so close to the original movie in feeling and tone. It did not depend completely on the original cast as the entire movie is mostly carried by it's young cast. I give kudos to the humor that was sprinkled throughout (Bill Murray?) and the story and character development that made you care for what happened to these people. Wonderful, I am definitely going to watch again as it moves pretty fast.Director Ivan Reitman does his father proud. So much feeling. It is as much a tribute to Harold Ramis as to the original movie. The trailer was not very good but I recommend that you do not miss this movie whether or not you are a fan.

93,93,guskeller,Solid departure,7/10,19 November 2021,"Although it's completely different from the original, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is solid. In fact, its departure is its strength and its obligation to the franchise is its biggest flaw. Fundamentally, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a family drama and a coming-of-age story, flavored with supernatural mystery. Had it been completely severed from Ghostbusters, it might've focused more on that light drama and used the supernatural more sparingly. The mystery might've been more compelling, the third act might've been in tune with the rest of the film, and there might've been fewer fan service distractions. However, despite its split personality, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is adequate because of craft in key areas.First, there is Mckenna Grace. She drives the film with a concrete character and strikes chemistry with all her costars. Next, the visuals are surprisingly thoughtful.

94,94,actaction,Want We Wanted; Just Not Enough of it,7/10,19 November 2021,"So Ghostbusters 3, which I call it because it's spiritually tied with the franchise (unlike that other reboot garbage), is a very well made film. No more glitz than needed, feels tied to the universe & has a very cleverly written script with snappy dialogue. Nothing is wrong with it except there just wasnt enough for this long of a wait. Yes, we wanted the real ghostbusters but they are left for a predictable and pretty static last 20 minutes (with only a phone call to motivate it). How much clearer could fans be? We want the freaking original characters continued. What we have instead is an extended cameo with the originals, but with very little additional development of them. The new characters are, to its credit, worthy of our time and not trying to be bad-ass cliche gender flipped bizarro ghostbusters, but are who they are because of the need for the script. A great female character is written in with a purpose other than just to pose. She's smart, memorable... and a girl ghostbuster. Perfect. There's also a very memorable teacher character in the scene stealing Rudd. The brother and the mother are less developed, but they are also enjoyable. The plot is close enough, without too directly repeating it. BUT, what is missing is the fun moments with ghosts messing with townspeople. A couple of quick flashes to a skeleton being served coffee is not enough. The film missed a major opportunity to have a montage of fun before it got serious. The three OG ghostbusters should have been brought in far earlier, had some moments where they pull themselves together and show who they have been for 30 years. Too much is taken for granted with the characters people came to see. Still the film has charm, heart and very little posing for glammed shots of slow motion putting on the suits. Thank goodness someone with some brains got a hold of this before Sony ruined it completely. Compared to 2016, this kept with the meaning behind the franchise. Not just fan service, but doing a good idea justice.",Ghostbusters: Afterlife

96,0,TheLittleSongbird,Very odd and uneven but also quite fun and intriguing,6/10,29 November 2021,"There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.For me though, bigger selling points were seeing two of my favourite actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons again (and reunited after 'A Merchant in Venice'). Jared Leto has always been very take and leave. 'House of Gucci' turned out to be one of those difficult to rate and review sort of films for me, it is going to be one of those films that some are going to love and others are going to hate (with some in between). It is a hugely flawed film, but there was also a lot to enjoy at the same time. As far as Scott's films go, it's a middling effort. Neither one of his best or worst.'House of Gucci' has a lot that is good in my view. Have very little to complain about when it comes to how it looks, apart from some editing being in need of a tightening in the final act. The Italian scenery and the costumes are truly stunning though and the camerawork is similarly sumptuous. Scott's direction is uneven dramatically but is very impressive on a technical level, especially in his use of multiple cameras (which must make it easy for actors to know where to look). The soundtrack is also wonderful and beautifully operatic in scope, though not always well placed, but from a standalone point of view there are no complaints here.Despite the very all over the place accents, with a mix of exaggerated (Leto, to almost cartoonish effect in his case) or barely there (Irons, am a huge fan of Irons but will never deny about accents not being a forte of his), most of the acting is fine. Lady Gaga kills it as Patrizia, who is a very interesting and well fleshed out character here, bringing charm, effortless charisma and menace to her. It has been said that her accent isn't great, as far as the cast goes it's actually the most convincing one along with Salma Hayek's. Adam Driver is a good deal more understated, one of the few in the cast to play it very straight, but he is also compelling and his character growth/decent is believable. They have great chemistry together.The supporting cast on the whole support them well, Pacino coming off best having a whale of a time as Aldo. Irons brings vulnerability and authority to patriarch Rodolfo and Salma Hayek gives some of her best acting in years. Really liked the chemistry on the whole, Lady Gaga and Driver are great together as are Lady Gaga and Hayek, while that between Irons and Pacino is a joy. 'House of Gucci' does have a few great individual scenes, and one of the best is the magnificent encounter between Irons and Pacino. Personally thought the first half was fine and that it set up the intrigue and characters extremely well. As well as a few funny moments, Rodolfo's verbal brutalising of Paolo was gold and sums up the viewer's opinion of him and his work perfectly.On the other hand, 'House of Gucci' has a number of shortcomings. One performance didn't work for me and that was Leto. Unrecognisable in much talked about(the talk of social media when advertising was first revealed) makeup that deserves its own film, he overplays his role, especially when the comic relief becomes more dominant, and belongs in a completely different film. Yes the film is very over the top in tone, but Leto's performance veered on excess and too much of a Super Mario Brothers caricature. There are pacing issues, the rather underdeveloped family business stuff drags, sometimes to the point of stalling, due to the lack of tension and gravitas that was not there enough. And other parts come over as very choppy and incomplete feeling, like the final act. The second half needed a tightening up, which would have made the film less overlong (and it is a film that could have been 25 minutes shorter easily).Also found the ending very rushed and anti-climactic, handled with too much of an indifferent shrug. After spending so long on the family stuff (and not developing that enough) and the increasingly uneasy spurts of comedy, the event that caused such a sensation is just too throwaway in treatment. Tonally, 'House of Gucci' is messy, the comedy going for the campy approach that goes too far into pantomime in the second half and some of the serious moments being too melodramatic. Tonal shifts can be uneasily abrupt.The script has some funny and intriguing moments, but is on the whole too overwritten in tone (Leto's comedy increasingly gets too much), bland emotionally (the descent into revenge is not examined enough) and also too much of a trying to include as many iconic lines as possible. Some of the line delivery has to be heard to be believed, can imagine right now the amount of reaction gifs online in regard to some of the more comedic lines and Leto's body language.Concluding, hugely flawed but also quite fun when taking it for what it is. 5.5/10 (was struggling which score of 5 or 6 to give it but decided to go in between and round it up)",House of Gucci
97,1,CinemaSerf,Browns and Pastels....,7/10,27 November 2021,"It isn't often that I can say this, but for me the best actor by a country mile here is Jeremy Irons. He plays the aging Rodolfo, whom along with his far more flamboyant brother Aldo (Al Pacino) owns and runs the legendary Italian fashion house. His son Maurizio (Adam Driver) falls in love with Patrizia (Lady Gaga) who the daughter of a trucking company owner and needless to say his dad is less than impressed. He proceeds to cut his son off, but the younger man has fallen totally for his ambitious and savvy new gal, and soon they are married and working with his uncle. Meantime, feeling neglected, and with his nose out of joint, Aldo's ditzy son Paolo (an almost unrecognisable Jared Leto) tries to tap up his uncle Rodolfo with some of his own designs - and my favourite scene as the older man calls a spade a spade ensues! Much of the best of the rest of this has been largely leaked in the trails. Gaga is good, but not great and far too much time is spent on the character establishment. By the time we get to the serious story of how this marriage and this family and this business all turned in onto themselves, betraying and scarring as they went, the pace turns decidedly slow and the events of the story itself become really quite rushed. Way too much of the denouement is encapsulated by one scene and by on-screen text. Had less been made of the preamble, then I think Sir Ridley Scott could have made much more of the interesting and entertaining causes of the dynasty's troubles. Still, it's is enjoyable and flies by. Well worth a watch.",House of Gucci
98,2,ferguson-6,the joys of family,7/10,24 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've never purchased or owned anything Gucci, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the heck out of Ridley Scott's film that brings the longest, most expensive and dangerous real life episode of 'Family Feud' to the big screen. It's co-written by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, and is based on the 2001 book, ""House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden. Brace yourself for a (mostly) true wild ride, and for what is likely to be one of the year's most divisive films - plenty of love and hate (just like the actual story).What happens when a brand is so closely associated with a family name? The arguments begin on who 'deserves' to be a Gucci, who is a 'real' Gucci, and who should make the decisions that impact the Gucci family and business wealth and reputation. During the extended run time (2 hours, 37 minutes), we see many of the iconic Gucci items: the Flora scarf, the moccasins, the bamboo bag, and the watches. And though high fashion is always present, director Scott has delivered a spectacle of romance, family riffs, extravagance, greed, power, betrayal, revenge, and crime.Lady Gaga (Oscar winner, A STAR IS BORN, 2018) stars as Patrizia, the newest Gucci. Hers is not blind ambition, but rather calculated and laser-focused. That she implodes a dysfunctional family is only a portion of the story. After marrying Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), Patrizia immediately begins manipulating her husband into reconciling with his family and taking on an active role in a business for which he previously had little interest. This is simply step two (the first was marriage) in her grand scheme to control the business and the money. Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, 1990) is ailing, so it's Uncle Aldo (Oscar winner Al Pacino, SCENT OF A WOMAN, 1992) to whom Patrizia directs her attention. She plays it like a chess match - only this is more entertaining to watch unfold.Also in the picture is Paolo Gucci (a truly unrecognizable Jared Leto, Oscar winner, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB), Aldo's son, and a family outcast. Paolo is a wildly creative individual who tends to his pet pigeons and tries desperately to find his place in the family. Jack Huston plays Dominico De Sole, Rodolfo's consigliere and the family attorney. Each of the characters is given their time in the spotlight, including a terrific breakfast scene with Pacino and Irons. Of course this is mostly Patrizia's story, so it's Lady Gaga's performance that will attract much of the attention and commentary. I found her mesmerizing and twisted fun to watch as she proceeded with backstabbing and trickery. Driver's quietly intense approach makes the perfect contrast to hers.If you are familiar with the story, you know that Maurizio does eventually run the company, and he also tires of Patrizia's family-crushing antics ... which send him back into the arms of Paola Franchi (Camile Cottin, STILLWATER, 2021). This turns the campy and juicy melodrama factor up to 11 (on the Spinal Tap scale). Patrizia's frequent trips to fortune teller and TV psychic Pina Auriemma (Salma Hayek) cause a massive tonal shift in the film, leading to the well-documented conclusion. If all this isn't strange enough, Ms. Hayek is the real-life spouse of the CEO of Gucci's present-day parent company, Kering. Reeve Carney (""Penny Dreadful"") has a small, yet vital role as up-and-coming fashion designer Tom Ford.In this movie, it's easy to describe some performances as hammy or over-the-top, but that's likely to only hold as a first reaction. Leto's characterization of Paolo sticks out so much from the others ... but he was known as eccentric, and at best, was patronized by the family. It seems highly likely that his personality and approach stood in stark contrast to the old-school style of his father Aldo, or the more staid personalities of his Uncle Rodolfo and cousin Maurizio. Lady Gaga as Patrizia is cunning and shrewd in her calculated approach to re-structure the family and the business. She plays whatever games she must to get where she wants to be. I found her first half performance to be truly outstanding. Pacino is the actor who has trademarked hammy performances over the years, yet here, he fully grasps his role and character, and is a delight to watch.Much of this is documented by history, though the Gucci family claims not all is or was how it seems. Whether the boost in counterfeiting/knock-offs went down in the 70's and 80's as it's portrayed here, might be an area worth researching, but this is much less a case study in business principles as it is one in family dynamics. I'll certainly understand those who argue against the story structure here, but the entertainment value proved to be enough for me. As the Gucci tagline goes, ""Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten"", but the backstabbing and disloyalty is never forgotten - despite providing great theater (and fashion).Opens in theaters on November 24, 2021.",House of Gucci
99,3,blanbrn,Well done in depth film that's done with style and it showcases a rise and fall!,9/10,26 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" for sure and really is one well done drawn out bio type picture that tells of the Gucci empire family. The scenes, and music is timely with the film and the costumes and clothing worn by Lady Gaga and her Patrizia Reggiani character set the film aside with elegant grace and style. Patrizia(in a fine performance from Lady Gaga) is a poor working girl from the wrong side of the tracks and at a party her Italian ways help hook her an up and coming law student in one Maurizio Gucci(Adam Driver). However she soon finds out she's married into an empire family that's full of gold.The Gucci family is one powerful family of wealth, fashion, and influence with connections back and fourth between Italy and New York. However greed, power struggle and inner conflict lead to drama and slowly but surely the undoing and downfall of an empire. Good supporting turns are given from film veterans Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, and Jared Leto as Gucci family members. Also Patrizia relies on advice from palm readings and cards from a psychic reader(Salma Hayek). Lady Gaga shines in this role as her turn is very elegant and sexy(one of her best ever, plus the scene of her in a black bra is very sexy!). The movie is a fine and well done bio type tale of the real life rise and fall of a family empire, plus along with the drama the film entertains in a stylish and in depth way.",House of Gucci
100,4,ElMaruecan82,Veni. Vedi. Gucci...,7/10,24 November 2021,"After watching ""House of Gucci"", I know ambition and the thirst for gold can be so fiercely boundless they would drive anyone to the most extreme corners. I could believe it thanks to the performance of... Jared Leto!How he transformed himself into Jeffrey Tambor's clone is already an achievement in transformation, but Leto wanted more, he wanted the golden statuette and when you're in the supporting department surrounded by Jeremy ""Scar"" Irons and Al ""Scarface"" Pacino as patriarch brothers Rodolfo and Aldo Gucci, it's a whole new level of over-the-top that you've got to reinvent.Leto's embodiment of Aldo's worthless son Paolo is the kind of self-deprecating prowess to be seen to be believed. Trust me: he might have been a mediocre designer but every single scene with him was designed as an Oscar clip. Every second of each moment with Leto contains a mimic, a look, a grimace, a dancing, a crazy laugh, anything begging us to notice him... and only him. Leto is the film's scene-stealer.In fact, he doesn't steal the show but the whole movie, all the pathos invested in that performance, making Fredo Corleone look like Al Capone, is one of the most joyously campy performances I've seen since ""Mommie Dearest"" and I I hated him... not because he was bad, but because he was so desperately good at stealing the show he might have stolen Al Pacino's chances to get his tenth Oscar nomination.Yes, I'm a Pacino fan and he was the reason I couldn't wait for the film, but ever since the second trailer's release, he didn't seem to get any attention although I believe he deserves a few praises. Anyway, I have nothing against Leto getting an Oscar nomination as long as Pacino pulls a Joe Pesci in ""The Irishman"". And both bring so much life in what could have been a rather grim story that the way I see it, either you award both or no one.. well, except for the Razzies.Sorry to fill the review with awards talk but let's not kid ourselves, this is a star-studded biopic released at the end of the year... ever since the project was announced, everyone was waiting for Thanksgiving and not for Black Friday but the Black widow plated by Lady Gaga. Fans are already lobbying for her Oscar win this time (the nomination is obvious). And you know what, they're right! Adam Driver effaces himself magically as a passive, undecided, husband too nice to be a lawyer let alone venturing in the jungle-like fashion world... with a lionness for a wife.And so the real Driver is Patrizia Reggiani, a fiercely ambitious woman who once landed her eyes on Maurizio knew she would marry him. In fact, once she knew his surname. Gaga's performance is a masterstroke of subtltety, notice how her look shifts when Maurizio says ""Gucci"", perhaps 75% of his charm, her courting is certainly the best example of a woman playing easy-to-get and yet there's something genuinely sincere in her act that contradicts the way the trailer exposed her as a villain. She's venal all right, but that doesn't prevent her from truly loving her husband and wishing to elevate him. Alas, she realizes very quickly that the curse of the Gucci family is just as if the Corleone had only Fredos in charge. Maurizio, is more Hagen-like, he who's definitely not cut for business wartime.But Patrizia, what a woman! And Gaga is so natural in that role that I noticed she didn't just have the talents, but the looks as well. After that and ""A Star is Born"", I wish she could drop the whole Gaga extravaganza and be herself, it's not just in the film, she has something of Liz Taylor. In other words, she's a natural. And she's so good that she makes the film's flaws more apparent. Forget about Leto's clownish manners, forget about Pacino, Pacino's good, problem's pacing.That's where the film doesn't play in the league of Ridley Scott's classics, he seems to have shot the film quickly to match the holiday schedules. Fair enough but the editing suffered a little, some scenes cut abruptly, the transition of Aldo Gucci from an ally to a liability feels odd. But the real problem is the way Patrizia turns into a supporting character during the third act. Some critics pointed that the film is too long, I would nuance that statement, it takes so much time building the relationship that the film can't afford her disappearance for too long. Yes, it's that pint-sized lady that carries the film more than all the other male-cast combined (even Salma Hayek is totally overshadowed by her aura)There are some good performances in the last act with honorable mentions to Jack Huston, Youssef Kerkour and to a lesser degree, Camille Cottin who's given an even more thankless role than Driver... but there's too much elements slowing down the film instead of building up its way to the deadly climax. For all the efforts pulled by Gaga, the ending seems anticlimactic and needlessly depressing while it needed a little cynical edge to it. What it does get with the final line and obligatory 'where are there now?'.Anyway, if people compared the film to ""The Godfather"" I think it's closer in spirit to ""Goodfellas"" and all these period films that use timely pop songs to bring the musical texture of the era. I won't speak of the accents but sometimes Scott insist a little too much on the ""Italian"" factor and that comes from an opera fan. Anyway, to stay in that spirit, let me say: ""Veni. Vidi. Gucci"". I came, I saw, I didn't yawn, I might have cringed here and there but overall, I enjoyed it.It could have been better but let me tell you this film will still be remembered in a few decades, I'd bet my annual salary... which wouldn't buy one pair of Gucci's second-hand socks.",House of Gucci

I would not say I'm overly impress; I will say I was greatly entertained by her performance. She definitely ate up the scenery.I also want to give credit to Jared Leto who also gave a scene steeling performance whenever he was on the screen.Al Pacino and Jeremey Irons were good but not as good as Gaga and Leto. They got to be entertaining but like everyone else acting in the movie they were mostly straight men for Gaga to go off on, and even though Adam Driver should have been enough of a straight man for Gaga, he wasn't. Driver is a good actor but this was not his thing.This movie was hard to take seriously and I hope that was the intension. A lot of parts in this movie made me laugh but I was never quite sure if that was the intension. It felt like a Soap Opera and was just as ridiculous sometimes.All of this made for a really food film to watch. I was into it, it made me chuckle and it did not bore me. I say, great flick.",House of Gucci
102,6,JoBloTheMovieCritic,House of Gucci,8/10,27 November 2021,"8/10 - if you can get over the style shift from trailer to feature film and a somewhat lengthy runtime, you will find objective proof that Lady Gaga, as an actress (and all-around artist), is a force to be reckoned with as she grounds this deeply fascinating and well-made fashion flick.

106,10,Pairic,Gaga is a force of nature,8/10,29 November 2021,"House of Gucci: Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) wasn't solely responsible for the fall of the House of Gucci but she certainly helped. Like a force of nature she hooks Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) when Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) disowns him she wins over the uncle, Aldo (Al Pacino). When Maurizio is reconciled with the dying Rodolfo and inherits his shares in Gucci she turns on Aldo and his hapless son Paolo (Jared Leto). Forging signatures on share certificates results in police attention, When Maurizio tires of her she decides to remove him from the equation. Wonderful settings in Milan and the Italian countryside, palatial villas and apartments. Gaga is a convincing conniver as Patrizia whose low cunning is just not good enough in the end to conquer all. Salma Hayek is the mysterious medium Giuseppina Auriemma, Patrizia's confidante, consigliere and co-conspirator, when her spells don't work on Maurizio she turns to Sicilian contacts. The Guccis (both young and old) though were tax-dodgers and spendaholics who would have eventually brought down their business through their own antics. The third generation, Maurizio being a good frontman but not a manager; Paolo inept but full of delusions of his own artistic abilities; could endure the attentions of neither Patrizia nor investment funds. Thus are the chronicles of The Fall Of The House Of Gucci, a serious comedy thriller. Directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna. 8/10.",House of Gucci
107,11,dierregi,"Decent fictional biopic, awful soundtrack",5/10,29 November 2021,"Based on true event usually means that the true events were fictionalised and made more spectacular. Since I am Italian, I already knew what happened between Patrizia Reggiani and Maurizio Gucci, because at the time their lurid story occupied headlines in national newspapers. The real story seemed to have gone more or less as described, with Patrizia being a vulgar gold digger, who used to consult fortune tellers and ended up hiring her killer via her best acquaintance in that line of business, once Maurizio dumped her.Lady Gaga is quite good and looks a lot like a better version of the real Patrizia, Driver is unexceptional as usual, although his part probably called for a weak character, Pacino was more subdued than usual, which was much appreciated but Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci was unbearably over the top and more than an eccentric Italian seemed a psychotic guy on the loose with a dreadful accent.Even if costumes and locations were generally OK, the soundtrack was awful: way too much opera and believe me, most Italians don't listen to opera all the time, plus a couple of Italian songs from the Sixties, when the film takes places in the Eighties and a few disco hits blasting on at the wrong time... totally the wrong atmosphere, not Italian unless you think time stopped with Dolce Vita or even earlier with Verdi.Apart from awful soundtrack, some parts (mainly all those with Leto) dragged on too long and dragged the movie down. On a side note, why didn't they hire any Italians for the movie? For instance, why choose the Mexican Hayek when an Italian could have done for such a role?",House of Gucci
108,12,rgkarim,"Gucci Gucci Goo: This Baby is Stylish, sleek, and Acting is Complete",8/10,24 November 2021,"LIKES:The Setting:
It's amazing to say the least, a crafted world of history brought back to life with the amazing budget Hollywood brings with it. House of Gucci drops us back to the 1970s and 80s, and brings the energy of the world with it in the form of buildings, clothes, cars, and practically everything else. All the culture is fun to relive, and seeing the transitions of Patrizia, alongside the family, during these time periods really helped with the immersion into the story, which I find important in a movie like this.The Costumes and Makeup:
If you are doing biographies, you've got to have the look of the characters as well in order to really bring the movie home. Again, well done on this movie, for the makeup has indeed turned our actors into the reflections of the Gucci family. The extra layers of skin, the changes in body structure, alongside an ever changing profile as they age was incredible to watch over the run time. It's great attention to detail and worthy of recognition at the award shows for the amazing execution of capturing the look. Complementing that is the costume work that they pulled into this movie, and the high profile our characters model. House of Gucci is about a fashion empire, and they dress the part with lavish outfits that are fancy, but not to the point of being obscene. Looking at a few of the historical picks, the mimicry of the styles was beautifully recreated and incorporated, using the clothes as a statement and weapon to represent the name of Gucci. Ten points for the incredible work that they did in this form.The Music:
A sucker for a good soundtrack, House of Gucci accomplishes this goal for me by picking A list songs from the time period they were in. While that's not hard to accomplish in the golden age of music, Gucci's director of music impressed me with the selection for the scenes and how well the songs represented the moment. Heart of Glass for a romantic sequence that is very fragile is not only toe tapping, but a great reflection of the mindset, while Faith (which is modern) manages to work itself into the mix for describing the wedding of the two at the start. It's a cute way of bringing that extra factor to the mix, and I was very happy with the results that we got, including a little Italian classics to sneak in as well.The Pace:
I feared it would be awful, but Scott seems to have found a nice balance of moving and storytelling that accomplished the goal of the drama genre. There are enough fun parts to help break up the monotony, and he does a nice job guiding you through the complicated sea of business to help you embrace the storm. Yet, the drama is very well mixed in, and manages to take the magnitude of a Soap Opera and curtail it to quality work worthy of the theater. This is not easy to do for a reviewer like me, but Scott again succeeded in the strategic story telling with his screenplay group.The Acting:
Are we surprised this is my favorite component? Don't be, because this all-star cast did a great job hitting their marks in this tale of dark dealings. Gaga is stunning as Patrizia, combining her seductive and dark nature from AHS: Hotel but upping the game to the levels we saw in a Star is Born. The accent is neither out of the park or bad, but she utilizes it decently to belong in the world, while letting her mannerisms, facial acting, and attitude drive the bus of the antagonistic role. She sells the malice well, and conveys the greedy side we got from the trailers to an art that was scary good. Adam Driver was my favorite of the group, once again meshing into his character and becoming one with the look and feel of Gucci. A complicated role that required capturing the air of the man, Driver succeeds on so many levels that convey his commitment to the role. I love his transitions in character, his ability to gradually change the nature of his character and show the emotions that come with the changes to his life. He was charming, he kept in balance, and I loved seeing the struggles he had to face in finding himself. As for Pacino, the man's transformation in character was stunning to say the least, but wow did he bring the uncle who tried to be the bridge beautifully. I had fun with his role, and really felt like he was the fun uncle that people loved and was a lifeblood of the Gucci family. He was utilized well into the film, and though not the central character, really played the part to the level I think they wanted.DISLIKES:A Few Slow Points
The pace is better than I expected, but not perfect and there are times when House of Gucci takes a little detour to the slow side. A few side conversations here, a few shots of sex there, and you get this small inconsistency that was like a gnat flying around to occasionally get in your way. Gucci managed to keep it mostly trimmed to the point, but I can't say there were not moments that could have been substituted for something else.The Selection of Scenes
Gucci's history must be pretty extensive, and I think they got the premise of the movie as a whole to covey the power war that was within that family for much of the film. However, I can't help but think that they could have picked better scenes to denote the corruption and destruction that we were seeing. Some of the moments seem a little to day-to-day life, and some liberties could have been taken with seeing Patrizia's workings in the family. Instead of seeing a couple of raunchy sex scenes, we could have sacrificed a few to perhaps show more planning or her indulging into the lifestyle that she ""drinks"" in so to speak. Again, there is enough cohesion to give you the picture in the fine feast of drama, but still there were elements that could have been doctored to give us that more fitting drama the world has become addicted to.More Time With Other Characters:
Again, I get who this is about and what it involves in the dance of destruction that Patrizia and Maurizio perform in this film. Yet when loading up a family drama, I had hoped other characters might have been used a little more or in a different manner than what we got. Jeremy Irons' character has some introducing starts, but then sort of fades to the back burner, hostilities between Jared Leto's character start out strong, but that too fell to mediocrity, lacking the full Scott package I l myself like to see. This goes back to the buffet of the story we had, but some of the things picked did not feel fully thought out or utilized with the dramatic spin they could have done. Even if the events had been made up and we got Patrizia doing more with them, I might have felt the full performance promised in the trailers.Did We Get The Full Malice Factor of Patrizia:
Gaga gives a great performance for me and again is impressive in her acting ability evolution, but the direction of the film may not have taken the full liberties of the malice her character could have brought. Certainly there are plenty of moments, especially in the dialogue, where she presents the greed she is addicted too. Yet, there could have been a lot more with the girl who pulled so many strings to guide the Gucci's to their status. A few side deals perhaps? More of her lavish spending and control of finances? A combination of things could have been chosen, but alas, I did not feel we got the full package of the plague that she was.The Time Jumps:
For me, the part that seems to have gotten in the way of the film the most was the time lapses that this thing did for meeting the attention span of the audience. House of Gucci puts a lot of history into the film, but then sort of fast forwards through the years in the quest for the ultimate fate. There are times where it executes it well, but there are times where I think the skips have denied the full potential of the characters to come out and/or dropping the acts that I had expected to be seen by Scott's direction. Again, it's not horrible for the most part, but I can't help but think there is a director's cut to be released to give us more for home viewing that may address this problem. This is especially true with the ending, which does put the final bow on the whole package, but is in a scene that feels very big budget for the little it does, when a simple picture montage with words could have done the same thing.The VERDICT:
House of Gucci has the style, the class, and the cultural lifestyle that Scott is famous for injecting into his films. Utilizing a sensational mix of style, setting, and costumes, he has brought the essence of the fashion empire to life and unleashed the desire to dive into the products and history of this family. With fantastic music to further paint the picture and acting that really shines for most of the cast, this dramatic biography gets lots of Oscar nods towards several of the big categories of fashion. Yet, in terms of story, there feels that more needs to be done to fully get the malice promised in that trailer. Perhaps it's due to time constraints and the cornucopia of information the nearly two decades held with them. Maybe, it was budget and Covid constraints that led to cuts in order to maximize profit? Yet it could be the source material and trying not to go too far down the movie magic hole. I don't know, but something is off in the time lapses and inconsistent details that does not destroy the film, but also limits the potential. Perhaps we will get a director's cut in the future, but until then, the film is definitely worth a visit to the theater for quality drama.My scores for the film are:
Crime/Drama: 8.5

109,13,vengeance20,"It's Alright, But Way Too Long & Boring Mostly!",3/10,29 November 2021,"Heard much about this film & saw plenty of previews & interviews about it prior to release & thought to give it a watch as I myself have obviously heard of the Italian Clothing Brand Gucci.The film basically tells the story of the controversial feud behind the Italian clothing brand & the paid assassination of Rodolfo's son Maurizio by his ex wife, Patrizia.I found the film to be pretty slow & boring. Not a lot happens & when it does it's not great, the pay off just isn't there. At 2 hours & 31 minutes, this film is stupidly long & has terrible pacing issues. A lot of scenes could've easily have been cut out & did nothing but drag the film out. 30-40 minutes easily could've been exercised from this film as well as some added action, yes I know the film is a drama about the real life clothing company but come on, you need to keep the audience investigated otherwise it just falls apart.But aside from that, the story was interesting enough, the eye candy was ace with Lady Gaga & some of the scenery was nice too.Overall, it's a long film that's mostly boring & lacks impact of action, aside from some eye candy & a few scenes, the film sadly fails.3/10.",House of Gucci
110,14,martimusross,"Al Pacino & Jared Leto Brilliant, The Rest Was A Snoozefest!",6/10,27 November 2021,"House of GucciOverall I'm afraid all the ingredients were present but this soufflé failed to rise. This movie had multiple problems with perhaps the most glaring one being the main lead was missing in action ""Gucci"", where was the glamour, the fashion, the branding, the fashionistas, all this buzz was absent and we were left with an Italian family arguing about spaghetti!About 45 mins in to a glacial 2 hours and 37 minutes, the whole thing sagged, it was baggy and lugubrious and lost all dramatic impetus, there was little script to speak of so it must be the editing, someone needs sacking!Now drilling down to specific woes:A movie like this cannot rest on the TV acting method style of Lady Gaga, it is so unfair to her, as it is way beyond her range. (less is more). I would have suggested that Salma Hayek and Lady Gaga should have swapped places, this might have worked. I don't mean to be overly critical but two crucial things are missing in Lady Gaga's acting, firstly the high polished surface and characterisation is sterile artifice, as there is just nothing in the eyes, it is emotions by wrote and numbers, secondly there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Adam Driver. This is a repeat of a Star is Born we saw the same sterility with Bradley Cooper.The script was awful, nothing happened, well make something happen, if you can't, then you haven't got a movie script or indeed a movie!The music, what a disaster.What was brilliant, Al Pacino and Jared Leto, wow is all I can say, they just bounced off each other, with pathos and comic timing. Adam was good but his range was limited in this role.Ok, overall this is a very weak 6 outta 10, I was bored, I fidgeted, I thought when will it ever end, I thought I've seen Lady Gaga's ""A"" face and even ""B"" face will I see ""C"" before this torture is over. I would say skip this drivel but Al Pacino alone made it worth the price of the ticket.Many reviews on here seem to have been made by Lady Gaga fans who can just see no wrong, I am a fan, but I am not deluded either, this was mediocre at best and we all know it!",House of Gucci

Director Ridley Scott has given us another modern classic, after The Last Duel(2021). Despite its long runtime, you don't get bored even for a single second.

112,16,jp_91,"Not amazing, not bad.",7/10,26 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" is a biopic that unfolds over low heat resulting in a decent but not incredible film, the direction is solid but I expected more from the great Ridley Scott. The performances fulfill their promise without standing out, except for Jared Leto who puts on a great performance. Salma Hayek, Jeremy Irons, and Al Pacino just put on good performances. The costume design is obviously focused on contemporary Gucci designs, making the story feel not even set in the '70s, '80s or '90s, decades in which the script is developed based on a true story. The greatest success of the film is the cinematography. The film was promoted as the one that would be the best of the year 2021 but it fails in the face of such an ambitious promotion. ""House of Gucci"" is a dry film, it can be seen but it remains a duty.

113,17,CANpatbuck3664,Lady Gaga is as Fantastic as Advertised but the Rest of House of Gucci is a Crazy Mess,6/10,27 November 2021,"I always have to start with the positive, that's always been my mantra even when trying to verbalize after seeing something horrendous. The tonal inconsistency in House of Gucci is insane but the movie does have a lot of polish. I must give credit to Dariusz Wolski (who regularly works with Ridley Scott) for the work he did filming this environment. The cinematography feels very cold and distant from all the high drama going on with the characters. The sets and atmosphere are pretty but instead of going with a hyper-stylized angle, Scott and his team went the other direction and it was an interesting contrast. More importantly, I cannot stress enough how much Lady Gaga's performance as Patrizia is dragging this movie up the mountain. Her back's got to be sore from carrying this movie. Despite the iffy dialogue, the weird character dynamics, the rest of the cast being all over the map and the strangely muted plot, I was entranced by her committed work in this. Despite the rest of the movie being a gong show, she does deserve award consideration for her portrayal in this and I applaud her going the extra mile. I also would add that while I was mostly flummoxed by this movie, it wasn't boring and while I got more than a few unintentional laughs, House of Gucci kept my attention and that should count for something.Going into House of Gucci, I was expecting Patrizia to be painted as a ruthless, and power-hungry tactician who saw Maurizio as nothing but her ticket to the good life. This isn't completely different from what we got but that kind of description is too simplistic for her character. By the end of House of Gucci, I didn't despise her like I expected to but that was more the result of the movie not presenting anyone to care about. She's still manipulative, nasty and arrogant but everyone else is so self-absorbed too. Maurizio is a sap who shows little emotion at first (to the point where the beginning of movie is extremely cringe-worthy) and he inexplicably buys into his own hype at the end of the movie when he's done very little to achieve what he has. Aldo is coasting of previous success, he overestimates his importance to the company and he is completely two-faced. Rodolfo is stuck in his ways and needlessly prejudicial and Paolo is a moron and lacks any awareness of the consequences of his actions. By the end of the movie, there are no sympathetic characters and despite the crescendo in the final scenes, I felt very little for any of them.I also expected some shady back-room deals being crafted, some tense power struggles between family and some insight into how Gucci became a high-fashion empire. You get none of that in House of Gucci. Any subplot involving how Gucci made its fortune or achieved business success is picked up and immediately dropped. The characters scream and holler but then are crying and professing love in the next moment and to some extent, they're all acting like a buffoons. The corruption isn't hidden or surprising with how the creative team chooses to present it and the excess of the Gucci family is treated with a collective shrug. Sure they're spending millions of dollars on toys when they don't have the money.....but they deserve that because their last names are Gucci? It was surprising how little depth there is to the plot and while I understand the decision to focus on the characters, I wanted more from the story.Let's move past Lady Gaga doing stellar work in the lead role, this is a packed cast but it seemed like everyone showed up with their own ideas of what to do with the material and there was no moderator to establish a consistent tone. Adam Driver is normally great but combine his bland character with him just being so muted, I couldn't care about Maurizio's problems. Put Jeremy Irons in the underacting camp as well, like Driver, his character seems to be drawn that way. He can't circumvent that however and he doesn't leave much of an impression as Rodolfo. On the other side of the spectrum, God bless Jared Leto for trying his best. I'm worried that this will be another Razzie nomination for him. His performance is akin to his Joker portrayal in Suicide Squad. To be fair, he's got serious acting talent and he's fully committed to the role. But he's so out of touch with the rest of the movie and I think he's supposed to be the comedic relief? His choices and the dialogue he's given are so outlandish that I didn't laugh or snicker, I just sat there is awe of how out of sync he was. Pacino is over-the-top too, just not to Leto's extent. I'm used to him being the tough guy and this character represented a curveball. Salma Hayek was fine, I had more questions about her character than comments on her performance.Its a small not but I also couldn't help but notice how off key the score is with the tone of the movie. The tone isn't consistent at all but the music in House of Gucci varies from opera to classical to contemporary pop and how they picked where each song was going to be inserted into the movie is a complete dice role. There's very little flow from scene to scene through the score. This carries over into the editing too, the movie feels really choppy. We'll get emotional scenes that smash cut to a board room negotiation for example and it just throws the narrative that much more out of whack.How in on the joke was the creative team for House of Gucci? That probably seems like a mean question but between the insane tonal shifts, the over and under acting, the messy score and editing and the bizarrely shallow plot, were they setting this up to be a campy masterpiece? This is a great so-bad-its-good movie for me. If I were to purely rate it on quality, its a 3 or a 4 but with Gaga's performance and the sheer insanity of the rest of the movie, I'll bump it up to a 6. The most similar movie I can think of is London Fields but even that's not an apples to apples comparison. I can't recommend seeing House of Gucci in theatres but if you're into this type of movie (ludicrous but entertaining), its absolutely worth streaming when it comes out on your preferred platform.",House of Gucci

This is not your average biopic mostly thanks to terrific performances (especially Driver, Gaga and Leto in my opinion). It has good pacing, excellent direction and photography, nice soundtrack. This is a great movie going experience!

115,19,elicopperman,The Story behind the Gucci Family Debacle,7/10,30 November 2021,"While the Gucci fashion brand has left an everlasting legacy for decades, many people don't know much about its controversial history. Although author Sara Gay Forden made a detailed biographical book on the Gucci dynasty in 2000, acclaimed filmmaker Ridley Scott has presented a film inspired by the events this year, with an ensemble cast such as Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Al Pacino & Salma Hayek. Despite obtaining a mixed reception from critics and not performing too well at the box office, it has been getting a good amount of attention from the media for its portrayal of the famed Gucci married couple corrupting each other for the sake of the company.Set in Italy, the film follows a young middle class working woman named Patrizia Reggiani, who ends up pursuing Maurizio Gucci, a shy privileged man who hails from the famed Gucci family. Upon marrying one another, their initial affectionate romance transitions into a ruthless fight for control of the Gucci brand. Similar to Forden's aforementioned book, the film recaps numerous events that led to the broken relationship of Patrizia and Maurizio, such as the class distinctions between their families, constant pushing to aim higher, Maurizio's own family members getting in the way, and even illegal financial turmoil. While it doesn't go into every detail about the Gucci's lives, it does highlight how overly persistent Patrizia is in taking over the lives of her husband, let alone an entire empire. Even if Patrizia does love Maurizio, it's only in lieu of her own selfish drive to push the Gucci brand further to suit her own ego. As quick as the pacing of the plot can be, it justly summarizes how one woman led her own in-laws down a path of deceit and corruption. Destruction of marriage is one thing, but destruction of human behavior can bring out the worst in a clan of people.That being said, the actors are what people will remember this movie for more, and the filmmakers definitely delivered on that front. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver steal the show in presenting the contrasting personalities between the seductive manipulator Patrizia and the anxiously minded Maurizio, mainly through specific facial expressions and aggressive actions over their otherwise exaggerated accents. Al Pacino shows so much love and passion as Maurizio's uncle Aldo, but can also flip to furious and overly hurt when confronting the differences in his New York lifestyle and how law is handled in Italy. Meanwhile, Jared Leto borders on caricature playing Aldo's oddball fool of a son Paolo, but the pressure from his family's standards and Patrizia's conniving nature allows for a ripe amount of sympathy in the otherwise weird man. Alongside Jeremy Irons, Salma Hayek, Jack Huston and Camille Cottin contributing a lot to the story with fewer scenes, the film allows a lot of logic to seep from the supporting cast to bounce off of the insane madness caused by Patrizia's malicious drive towards the Gucci brand. Sounds like the Oscars have some homework to do in terms of the cast.In terms of other qualities, it's impressive how quickly the film was shot and edited during the pandemic, in under a year. With that in mind, the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski paints an authentic view of Italy from the late 70s to the mid 90s just as much as the flawless production design. The filmmakers made excellent use of the time period by showing how grandiose the Gucci life is, especially from the perspective of the middle class Reggiani clan. Whenever the film showcases the Gucci brand work itself, one has to wonder how much effort it took for the people behind the film to secure any rights in displaying the immersively beautiful attire. The costume design also adds in to the film's believability, as the men tend to wear conservative outfits common for upper class business folk whereas the women have a more tight and unveiling wardrobe. The film gets a lot of creative mileage when the work of former Gucci fashion designer Tom Ford gets a spotlight in the third act, even if the hard work from the Gucci family has been left to the wayside. Perhaps many of the film's artistic choices are a result of style over substance, but at least the style adds into the narrative poignantly.So while it may juggle its tone between inspired camp and mournful drama, House of Gucci is an enjoyably interesting look into the events of the Gucci brand family downfall with a lovable cast, gorgeous set and costume design and important historical context. If you're interested in seeing the film, bet it for a historical perspective or for the cast alone, it's a solid enough recommendation, unless you'd rather stick to Sara Gay Forden's aforementioned biography. Even for a two and a half hour long venture, it doesn't feel the length as much as other overly long features these days. As far as infamous career scandals go, this feature has one heck of a downfall.",House of Gucci
116,20,PedroPires90,"Entertaining, fun, funny, over-the-top: what cinema needs the most!",8/10,27 November 2021,"House of Gucci put a smile on my face for over two and a half hours. It's a movie where Gaga shines at every moment, where Leto doesn't get tired of making us laugh and where the entire cast seems to have a great time. At 84 years old, Ridley Scott has nothing to prove and now makes movies for pure pleasure, caring nothing for what others will think. The tone that mixes comedy and drama may not be the most conventional for a crime story, but to talk about a crazy family, nothing better than a crazy movie.

118,22,ethanbresnett,Welcome to the House of Gucci,9/10,29 November 2021,"I found myself absolutely transfixed by House of Gucci. From the opening voiceover by Lady Gaga I was hooked and couldn't take my eyes off of the mad story that unfurled before me.As has been mentioned in numerous other reviews Lady Gaga's performance is a tour de force. Her portrayal of Patrizia Reggiani was incredible to watch and I would gladly watch this film again immediately purely to experience it for a second time. She was unstoppable in this film and everyone should see House of Gucci purely for her. It was a tough role with lots to the character and plenty to explore and dig through, and she managed it with great aplomb.As if that wasn't enough there's a terrifically entertaining (if slightly characitured and ludicrous) turn from Jared Leto who injected so much humour and light into the film. Adam Driver was brilliant, as was Al Pacino in a fantastic supporting role. All of them gelled so well together and I couldn't have asked for a better cast. The characters they played were so colourful and rich it was great exploring them and getting to know them.Telling the story of the rise and fall of various members of the Gucci family over a span of decades could have been quite lethargic and slow, but the story was well balanced and well handled. Perhaps a tad too long, 15 minutes could have been cut if I'm being honest, but that's such a small gripe. It was such a fascinating and outrageous story that I couldn't take my eyes off it and was always excited for what would be coming next.Much like the high fashion world it explored, this film oozed style and opulence. The sets, costumes, hair, makeup, all of them were spot on. It made the film feel so rich and refined.Really there isn't much to complain about with this film. Stunning performances, colourful characters, rich detail, intriguing story. One of ,y favourites of 2021 so far!",House of Gucci

122,26,Okonh0wp,One of the cinematic highlights of my year,9/10,28 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" presents us with an alluring view of the equivalent of the modern-day aristocracy (a European fashion dynasty) while simultaneously delighting us with an insider's peak of the the cracks in that facade. In other words, the film is sharply tuned enough to have its proverbial cake and eat it too.Set over a 20-year period, the film takes us through the many shifts in power in the Gucci family who ran an iconic fashion brand, back when being rich meant living the kind of visibly flamboyant life that would get you on page 6.Adam Driver as Maurizio is initially framed as the protagonist. He carries himself with suave in a way that someone can only pull off if they're born into class. Still, he's quiet and unassuming and just the right kind of stooge to have his world turned upside down when middle class opportunist Patrizia (Lady Gaga in a breakout performance) aggressively steals his heart similar to some of the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s when a matinee idol came face to face with a floozy like Barbara Stanwyck who could talk a fast game.As Maurizio and Patrizia get settled, Patrizia begins to Lady MacBeth her way through the relatives (Jeremy Irons, Jared Leto, Al Pacino) that stand between Patrizia and a greater share of wealth and power. And so begins a series of events that's darkly comic in a Coenesque way while giving the kinds of thrills from showing the financially mighty fall that makes shows like HBO's ""Succession"" such a huge hit.Considering she doesn't sing or don costumes made of meat, Lady Gaga immerses herself into this performance so well, it will have viewers doing a double take. Similarly, Adam Driver might have his best performance to date, Selma Hayek is a riot, and the cast's two elder statesman--Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons--command tremendous presence.Audience reactions might differ, but i found the film highly thoughtful and engaging through a plus-sized running time.",House of Gucci
123,27,eagandersongil,Post production problems,7/10,29 November 2021,"'A Casa Gucci', new film by the award-winning and great director Ridley Scott is a film with good moments but with several problems, especially in the script, we have many great characters that are left without construction while we have repetitive scenes, the more than two and a half hours of film are poorly used, the chronological transitions are painful and the story that is contacted, at least in my personal opinion, was not what we expected, I wanted to see the history of the brand as a whole and we see only 20 years of it focused on the couple that acted partially in command of the operation, this large zoom in a small part of a great journey leaves a lot to be desired, we have no explanation of the climax, we do not have the construction of important facts, often, great events simply happen and change the direction of the film without any impact to the viewer.Despite being better than the script, Ridley Scott's direction is confused, the director tries to use several techniques that don't talk, and in the end it looks like eight hours of film was recorded and they did an edit showing two and a half, because we have several continuity errors, strange transitions and bad use of the soundtrack, a soundtrack that is good, mainly its theme music, but as already mentioned, it is poorly used, the dark photography is a little frustrating too, but the costumes and makeup are good.What saves ""A casa Gucci"" is its cast, which is really, very good, all the actors steal the film at different times, it's impossible to name one, because in each tempo zone we really have a great prominence in the performances, perhaps the only actor and character that expected a little more was the one played by Jared Leto, but still, it's good.""The Gucci house"" disappoints a little, as we have a great director ahead of the project and a very good cast, several scenes work well and even in the midst of the film's hurricane, we felt Ridley Scott in some scenes, especially in details, but it was nice to see good actors acting together with a confusing but charismatic art direction. GRADE 7/10.",House of Gucci
124,28,movieman6-413-929510,"With more detail, different casting, and definitely better script writers, the movie could have been better.",5/10,28 November 2021,"House of Gucci is a new crime drama directed by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Alien.The film is inspired by true events surrounding the family behind the Italian fashion house Gucci. When Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) begins a relationship with the outsider Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), he is disinherited by his father Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons). He suspects that Patrizia is behind Maurizio's family money. That's how the two have to make it without the support of the Gucci family. Years later, the two are married and have a child together. Maurizio's uncle Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino) thus contacts him again and brings him back into the family business. The Gucci fashion house is once again going under multiple names, leading to creative differences, exposing betrayal, revenge and even murder cases.There have been many changes in the making of this film. Martin Scorsese, for example, could have directed the film at first, but Ridley Scott was eventually given a directing position. Together with the casting directors, he also had many ideas for the casting of the roles before they finally came to the chosen actors and actresses.After the many changes in casting and direction, they probably should have looked back at the writing crew of the film, because the final script was written by more novice writers, which can sometimes be seen in the film. The story can sometimes seem a bit messy and so long-winded, because the story makes many jumps in time. Some relationships come across as rushed, which can cause some loss of credibility.What comes out best in the film about a well-known fashion brand is therefore the costumes and make-up of the characters. Janty Yates can expect film award nominations for this. Still, the film has received complaints from actual members of the Gucci family that the relatives were better dressed in real life compared to the actors in the film. They also credibly convey the places where the story takes place.Al Pacino comes out the best of the film cast and knows how to provide the best and most believable accent compared to the entire cast. Lady Gaga and Adam Driver have good chemistry together in the film, but their relationship sometimes comes across as weak. Patrizia is clearly showing signs that she is more behind the Gucci family's money than she really loves Maurizio. Their accents can also come across as a bit unusual. Lady Gaga has more of an Eastern European accent than real Italian. Her characters seem to come more from Russia in some scenes. Of the entire cast, Salma Hayek is the only one who has received help with speaking in the correct accent. This is probably because she is married to the man who now owns the Gucci brand. If they had helped the entire cast a little more with their accents in the film, they would have come across a bit more like people from the same country. Who even seems to play in a completely different film is Jared Leto, because in the film he wears a fattening costume and also has a strange shaved hair style. In the film, he comes across as too exaggerated compared to the rest and speaks excessively in a high-pitched voice. He sometimes sounds just like the video game character Mario.",House of Gucci

126,30,tccandler,A mixed bag of good and dreadful...,5/10,27 November 2021,"The rise and fall and subsequent rise of the Gucci empire is an interesting story. The two leads are very good (Gaga and Driver), somehow holding all the disparate pieces together. However, director Ridley Scott lets the pacing get away from him. This film is easily 45 minutes too long. Also, there are some atrocious performances from Jared Leto, Al Pacino and Salma Hayek in supporting roles.

128,32,darkreignn,"Not really that good a film, but it is extremely entertaining",8/10,28 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" is an exercise in over-exaggeration - from the soundtrack, to the accents, to the performances, the only word that can be accurately used to describe this movie is ""ridiculous."" That said, this ridiculousness makes for one incredibly entertaining movie experience.I almost didn't go see this in theatres because I was somewhat taken aback by the 2 hour and 37 minute runtime. However, I begrudgingly dragged myself to the movies, and I'm so happy that I did. ""House of Gucci"" is self-indulgence at its best; if you ever wanted to see a story of vain, rich, and powerful people who want nothing more than to further grow their power and wealth, then this has you covered. Everything, from the performances to the way the movie is edited, feels amplified by the fact that the movie is portraying a group of narcissists, and I think Ridley Scott took this into consideration with his choice of direction. It would've been so easy to take this film, with its admittedly dark subject matter, and turn it into a depressing, dreary drama. Scott instead injects this film with telenovela level ludicrousness, and the movie is all the better for it.It's hard to say that anyone in this movie is good - that said, I can't exactly say that anyone was necessarily bad because of how much they entertained me. Everyone is certainly playing a character in this movie, and that character's name is ""Narcissus."" From Lady Gaga's raw hunger for money and status to Jared Leto's strong desire to be recognized for his ""gift"" in fashion designing, practically every actor and actress in this movie is playing someone who wants more; because of that, everyone over-exaggerates. And I loved it. The Italian accents? Bizarre. The dialogue? Pretentious. The performances? Totally scene-chewing (don't even get me started on Jared Leto's performance - completely bizarre, but extremely fun). But all of it worked strictly because this movie is depicting people who are completely separated from reality because of the fact that they have money and power.I feel like I've been repeating myself for three paragraphs, so now I'd like to simply answer this question: Is ""House of Gucci"" a good film? To be completely honest with you, I'm not so sure it is. As a whole, this movie is less of a coherent story and more of a collection of vignettes. The plot feels very jumbled, with the film moving from scene to scene with little narrative cohesion. Sure, we know the story involves Patrizia Reggiani ordering the killing of Maurizio Gucci, but that is barely explored in this movie. The consequences of that act? How Patrizia and crew were caught and convicted of such a crime? The effects that crime had on Patrizia and her children? These aspects are not touched on at all. Instead, the movie tells many individual stories about each character, and the Gucci brand. It wasn't the narrative choice I was expecting, but I didn't necessarily dislike this decision, as the ins and outs of the fashion business, and all of the backstabbing therein, made for some riveting viewing.Look, this isn't a great movie by any means - anyone can watch this and realize that it feels like a parody of the fashion business and the people that work in it, but I think that's all on purpose. Ridley Scott forgoes seriousness and embraces farce, and in ""House of Gucci,"" it works. I had an absolute blast watching this, and when rated on entertainment value alone, ""House of Gucci"" definitely is worth the theatre experience.",House of Gucci

130,34,herbqedi,Terrific Entertainment if a tad overlong,8/10,27 November 2021,"Vintage Ridley Scott entertainment - somewhat reminiscent of All the Money in the World. Great acting by entire cast - especially Lady Gaga and Adam Driver. Jeremy Irons always terrific but his accent faded in and out. Pacino at his best. Jared Leto was directed to play his part as an operatic caricature buffoon and did so impressively. Photography stunning and operatically themed music perfectly arranged.My only minor criticism is that Scott got a bit too much into his own operatic allegory with characteristic overplaying of dramatic scene endings. Some of the cinematic allegories also went on a bit longer and were less subtle than I personally would have preferred. Again, very minor. House of Gucci is a lot of fun with Oscar-nomination-worthy performances from its two leads and possibly Leto. As a movie, I thought both Belfast and King Richard were more Oscar worthy but if this gets a nomination, it would also be on merit. Expect a very good but not a great satire on the fasion industry and its celebrities and you won't be disappointed.",House of Gucci

132,36,bastille-852-731547,Bloated Gucci epic doesn't fully satisfy,5/10,24 November 2021,"Ridley Scott assembled an all-star cast for his period crime drama ""House of Gucci,"" but unfortunately the film's quality doesn't match the talents of those involved. The film tells the story of the relationship between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga,) as Maurizio tries to exert greater control over Gucci and expand its financial footing. Despite what the trailers may have you believe, most of the movie isn't about the assassination of Maurizio. While the film tries to settle on a variety of tones and plot points to emphasize, it ends up being a giant mess on many levels.The performances are a mixed bag, as each of the main actors seems to be acting as if they are in a different movie from one another. Adam Driver tries his best as an ambitious, no-nonsense Gucci, but performance lacks range and can feel cold at times. Lady Gaga is mostly solid, although some might feel that she overacts a little. Al Pacino is good, but unfortunately underused. Jared Leto's character is almost cartoonishly annoying and ridiculous. The screenplay isn't terrible, but it is rather generic and contains tons of unnecessary filler. Even scenes that could be potentially interesting on paper, such as a masquerade party where Maurizio and Patrizia met for the first time, are stripped down to predictable clichés when shown on screen. The film's aesthetics are uneven. As one might expect, the costumes are gorgeously and intricately detailed, while the cinematography of northern Italy is often potent. Yet the film suffers from poor editing, as some scenes are punctuated or accentuated by a quick finishing or starting cut to another moment that seems wholly unnecessary or abrupt. Yet ""House of Gucci""'s biggest flaw is simply that it is just dull and often boring. By failing to make its primary characters engaging or stick to a well-paced narrative structure, viewers may question whether the film really needs to be 157 minutes long. It's unfortunate that this film ended up being a misfire, given that both Ridley Scott and the talented actors making up the film's ensemble cast are capable of so much better. Not recommended. 5/10.",House of Gucci

134,38,varun-25071997,"Greed, Glamour, Glitz and Gucci",10/10,27 November 2021,"A star studded cast including the best actors of our generation and also veterans is bound to be a film of conflict and House of Gucci is exactly that. The 157 minute runtime goes like a bullet, not a single frame or shot is wasted here. Ridley Scott has delivered arguably his best work since Blade Runner. As far as performances go, this film is bound to get multiple nominations in the awards season with Lady Gaga, Al Pacino, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons and Adam Driver.The aura of Vice or American Hustle loomed over in the trailer but the writing and direction here is second to none. The film manages to give every character a good buildup and execution of their story. House of Gucci's biggest plus is that it has minimal nudity and sexual content and doesn't force it like in other movies to look ""raw and realistic"".

136,40,Benslie,Story is complicated to follow but great acting perfomances,7/10,28 November 2021,"The story of this movie seems simple enough but honestly, the story for this movie is super complicated and hard to follow. This story takes place over three decades but during those three decades, it's hard to figure out how much time has passed due to there being zero-time stamps to help out and when you do get them it's for a new decade. What doesn't help with being able to follow the story is the editing in this movie. The editing in this movie made it feel like different clips just mashed together to make a movie. Most of the time the editing for this movie just cuts away to a different scene with zero transition and it's very startling. With both of these combined, it's obvious that the pacing of this movie isn't the greatest. Almost nothing interesting happens in the story and the editing makes it seem like time is moving fast in the movie when in reality it's moving very slowly. Honestly, the only saving grace for this movie was the acting in it. Everybody in this movie, except for Jared Leto, gives it their all and I wouldn't be surprised if they all got nominations. Lady Gaga cements herself as a big-time actress with this movie with her portrayal of this manipulative and conniving person. Adam Driver was surprisingly really good in this movie and I don't mean that in a bad way. It was interesting to see how he portrayed the development of his character and how different he was from when the movie started to end. I mentioned that the only actor that didn't impress me was Jared Leto, who plays Paolo Gucci, and that's because I feel like he was given a completely different script than everybody else. His performance would've been perfect for the original movie I thought this was going to be but, in the end, he stood out like a sore thumb.

138,42,severindringel,When Americans pretend to be Italian...,5/10,26 November 2021,"The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.Yet Gaga is still a relative unknown in Hollywood-speak. She made her big breakthrough in the 2018 music film A Star is Born. Scott, as he did in The Last Duel, has assembled an incomparable star ensemble. Adam Driver, who seems to be establishing himself as the director's new darling, evergreens Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons and an unrecognisable Jared Leto embody the key roles in the Gucci clan. In addition, Salma Hayek emerges as a kind of mentor for Gaga's character. But who is Gaga playing anyway? She is the young and rebellious Patrizia Reggiani. An extroverted perennial who worms her way into the millionaire family with charm and fascination. She is courted by the ambitious Maurizio Gucci, played by Driver, who actually wants to leave the intrigues and sometimes shabby business dealings of his predecessors behind. Once he falls in love with Patrizia and marries her, he is left with no choice but to get involved again. Driver and Gaga share a very passionate chemistry in the first act, which you fully buy into with little dialogue and through pure body language. While Driver plays rather reserved and shy, this quality emanates especially from Gaga, who doesn't hold back in any of her intimate scenes. At least the two characters are able to unfold their own approaches here. But when Al Pacino's character Aldo Gucci, Maurizio's uncle, insists on his nephew's re-entry into the family business, the two lose all closeness to each other. Rather, it is only an extremely manipulative relationship that both actors have to show in a few scenes. All the more Aldo and his son Paolo Gucci, portrayed by Leto, come to the fore. From this point on, the film lapses into a few minutes of megalomania, largely due to Leto's performance. He is exclusively eccentric and desperate and all in all a tragic figure. Whether you find this Super Mario caricature brilliant or miserable is a matter of interpretation.House of Gucci begins extremely quietly and shows the rise of the lovers in well-done visual sequences. The performances are generally fitting and although the film seems anti-Italian, I love it when Adam Driver cruises through Milan on his Vespa. But as interesting as the pecking order and hierarchy within the Gucci family is, from the second act onwards the film devolves into an overplayed and hyperactive tragedy that, despite the craziness of its scenes and actors, actually manages to be long-winded. Fashion, creativity and the business idea are not a theme at all, which in no way brings us closer to this brand that is so present. In the end we have a family epic (the film lasts 2 ½ hours), with exclusively unsympathetic characters. One more request to Ridley Scott: just let your actors speak English and don't embarrass them with Italian stereotypes with accents.",House of Gucci

140,44,mageh,weak movie with bad choice of leading actress,6/10,24 November 2021,"I like Ridley Scott and i think he is a good director. But this is not his best movie: it is quite slow and boring, and it lacks quality due to the poor choice of Lady Gaga as a lead. She is NO actress, quite terrible. And she totally ruined the movie. Her accent is NOT Italian but sounds like bad imitation of Russian one, like the one I have. Actually, other actors are so much better that her lack of acting talent is even more obvious. With better actress it could be a good movie, but with her and slow story line, it is more of a lackluster. Skip it!

141,45,guskeller,"Gaga, Driver and Leto are exceptional",8/10,26 November 2021,"House of Gucci is a Machiavellian story brought to life by exceptional performances. Gaga, Driver, and Leto all deliver stellar skills to their roles and elevate the overall experience. Undoubtedly, their acting is worth the price of admission and the clear centerpiece of the movie. Leto vanishes into his makeup and provides the perfect amount of pathetic comedy, Driver is forceful with his quiet deceit, and Gaga pilots the show with madness cloaked in charisma. Meanwhile, the direction of Ridley Scott is assured and steady, giving space for the cast to shine and accenting the narrative with touches of glamour.However, while House of Gucci is certainly very good, its technical aspects prevent it from being unequivocally great. The music and production design are both very strong because they convincingly capture the era and extravagant lifestyle, but beyond that, there isn't much filmmaking that stands out here. The imagery, editing, and sound are all proficient, but none are used in any particularly memorable way. Therefore, House of Gucci just isn't quite complete enough to be iconic as a whole. That being said, it still brings plenty to appreciate and is time well spent.Writing: 8/10

142,46,OGmacadamia39,NGL -,7/10,28 November 2021,"I was excited for this movie - but weary as well. Ensemble casts are make or break, but somehow, House of Gucci managed to land itself in the middle, a little broken.How did it keep from breaking altogether? The acting. Everyone did actually do a great job in their roles. Where I believe things didn't align was in the way it was written and filmed.This was an incredible story. This was an awesome cast of actors who managed to do well in their roles / performances.But that didn't come through on screen. I wasn't captivated into their ""falling in love"" aspect of the story. I wasn't rooting for anyone. At first Patrizia is the heroine and you want to see the ""villian"" win - but that was from the trailer cuts, not from the film. I'm the film she was just whimsikku bleak during the breakup, vs enraged and vengeful. One scene played out around that topic, and it was a hire force a hit? How is that even possible. Poor storytelling. Each scene somehow met its duty, but missed the mark.Haters gonna hate and who am I but / IMO /
Ridley Scott is over-rated. I think someone else could have done a better job at creating this. Having heard some of the previous few that had been attached to it prior like the cohen brothers, it's interesting to imagine what it could have been in their hands.It's not bad - But you're kidding yourself if you don't think it could have been better.",House of Gucci

The only two actors that escaped this film with dignity was Adam Driver and Jeremy Irons and some of the secondary cast members, Lady Gaga, Al Pacino and Jared Leto came to this party and gave the audience some of the best scenes of overacting in 2021, Jared Leto kept you howling with laughter playing Paulo Gucci, I laugh at scenes that was not intentionally funny, Al Pacino as Aldo Gucci, his portrayal of this person, like that of Big Boy Caprice with a Gucci suit on, Pacino and Leto have a unforgettable scene together that was probably the most dramatic and also the most hilarious, Lady Gaga as Patrizia Gucci did a good job as the villain of this drama, but she went a little over the top with the accent and was hard to understand at times, very ambitious and glamorous production, but it was very campy at times and I believe it was unintentional, I enjoyed watching this film and the cast did a decent job, but the original Dynasty T. V. show was a better program in my opinion.",House of Gucci
144,48,montgomerysue,surprisingly good,8/10,28 November 2021,"I intentionally did not read anything about the Gucci family and the murder before seeing this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised by how good and fascinating their story is. This is an excellent production with wonderful sets and costumes and the acting by everyone is outstanding. I am not a big fan of Lady Gaga. I can take or leave her music and her real life personality, but, here, she is terrific, giving a memorable performance that far exceeded my expectations. Al Pacino continues his development from a leading man to one of America's best character actors. He is a hoot to watch. The others are also top notch and the direction by Ridley Scott is very good indeed. The only problem is the script. At times, it bogs down with over-developing the relationships between the characters, while absolutely no time is spent on the investigation of the murder. It would have been fascinating to see how these conspirators reacted to being investigated and charged with this sensational crime. But, all in all, a very good film that contains some of this year's best acting and a story that is quite engaging.

145,49,Bek204,Very disappointing and the writing ruined everything,7/10,28 November 2021,"House of Gucci has only one problem and that's the writing which is very disorganized and cheesy. However, the acting alongside the directing and cinematography are absolutely spectacular. Although there might be a few mistakes and problems in them that are noticeable and make certain scenes seem ugly and cheap.Ever since A Star Is Born (2018), Lady Gaga has proved herself as a very talented actress that is able to portray a character accurately. She was amazing especially in terms of doing her accent and being able to transform into a different kind of person especially since her character goes through that transformation phase slowly through the whole film. Adam Driver is also amazing and kind of surprised me, I was expecting a good performance but I was not expecting a great performance. Shoutout to the make-up and hairstyle department for making Jared Letto completely unrecognizable. His acting completes his great performance alongside the great makeup and hairstyling. Even though the supporting cast like Al Pacino and Jermy Irons had less screentime than the other 3 main actors and actresses of the film (Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, and Jared Letto), but their presents left an impact on the film because they present a great performance as usual.This film is based on a true story and it tells the story on many different timelines in which the movie jumps suddenly without the audience would know which makes the film confusing at some points and hard to follow in terms of the events and timeline. In addition, the film takes so much time to tell a specific action and takes much more time than it is required to take only to tell the story and the rival competition that is happening between the Gucci family. Therefore, it would seem very boring because it is long and once every scene or action that happens is over, it does not have something special that would leave the audience with something to remember or memorize afterward which therefore makes the whole movie unforgettable and would not be revisited again. 2h 37m is for sure way too much for a film like that especially since it can be boring at times and hard to keep track on. At some points in the film, you will get bored and lose interest in the story even though it is an interesting one, but the representation is very bad. It is supposed to be a serious story that is represented seriously, in which it is represented in the complete opposite. It becomes a funny, cheesy, boring, and not interesting story at all. The film succeeds in terms of the comedy side which is something that is upsetting but entertaining at the same time. Upsetting because this is a story that should be serious and dark not funny snd cheesy. Entertaining because they are actually funny, any joke or a try from a certain character to make the audience laugh, are most of the times successful and indeed funny and entertaining.Most of the time the song choices would not fit a certain scene or action that is shown which makes the scene very cheesy and ruins it as it becomes annoying just because of one bad annoying song that does not fit or go with the action that is happening. The custom designs are obviously great because it is a film that is about ""GUCCI"", so what do u expect other than good-looking customs? The cinematography and camera movements work perfectly alongside the set design to present stunning images that are very catchy to the eyes.Finally, House of Gucci is disappointing especially that its story is very interesting and has a great cast and big names like Adam Driver, Lady Gaga, and Al Pacino. However, the writing completely ruined it and made the film easy to forget and would not be revisited again.My rating is 7.5/10

For the most part, it succeeds.The performances are all so eccentric...they're actually kind of mesmerising. And the plot-though scatterbrained-is bursting with intrigue and surprising betrayals.Sadly, though, there are so many incidents in which characters' motivations are half-baked at best. It makes it difficult to become particularly invested in what's happening emotionally, because I just didn't understand these people.This is an ambitious film, and it hits the mark more often than it doesn't but it just tries to carry more than it can lift.

149,53,michaelxqh,Ridley Scott Needs to Focus,7/10,24 November 2021,"Personally, I really enjoyed The Last Duel which explains from 3 perspectives of the entirety of rape, lies, and power: clear moral and with a distinct director's style. Now to House of Gucci, I feel like the movie simply wants to tell a story that I couldn't relate to. Is the film about the renewal and iteration of a fashion empire, the subtle realization that led to the collapse of a marriage, or the prosperity and demise of a proud family? The right timing of incidents, tear, and sex gives the audience with just the right amount of every different impressions. However, the aftertaste is plain -- ""that was such a formatted movie"" I thought to myself. Ridley Scott needs to focus on what he, as a director, would like to shout out to the audience, instead of shooting everything from the script. Lastly, let's take some time to applaud to the devotional actors and actresses: Lady Gaga with her unsatisfied, active, and insecure Lady Gucci, Jared Leto's dramatic, incompetent, and tragic Pablo Gucci, along with Al Pacino performing the respectable, vivacious, prideful businessman, Aldo Gucci. They are the reason for the seven stars.",House of Gucci

Lady Gaga does an okay job along with Adam Driver but their characters are just boring. They need 2 hours of set up for 10 minutes of murder and they still were unable to make me interested in any character. Pacino and Irons don't do anything special either. The accents and Ad-libs are also terrible. In fact the whole script needed a major overhaul that it never saw. The film has no pacing. Avoid this film if you can.

153,57,nlsteven-attheMovies,Fashion victims,7/10,25 November 2021,"Fake Italian accents? Hmm..I assume the filmmakers intended it as (culturally insensitive?) satire rather than to give authenticity to a story about a native Italian-speaking family. Accents aside, House of Gucci is glossy, beautifully filmed and probably Ridley Scott's best work in ages. Lady Gaga digs deep into her Italian roots to deliver yet another impressive performance. Oscarworthy? Perhaps - sans accent. Pacino is the one to watch though. House of Gucci is a long movie, and I feel that the editors could have done a better job cutting out some of the sub-plots with an outrageous Jared Leto - he completely misses the mark as the insufferable Gucci pariah. Nonetheless, I'll go see it again just to revel in the Italian high society lifestyle. It's a sight for sore eyes.

155,59,kelboy10,Outstanding Cast and what do you know? An actual story of today's times,9/10,26 November 2021,"House of Gucci ensembled a magnificent group of actors with an actress in Lady Gaga leading the line of duty. After her performance in 'a star is born' I was intrigued to see what she could bring to this role and I must say she didn't disappoint. I must say I was never really a big fan of her music although I always respected the artistic music videos I saw of hers. Alongside her she is spoilt for choice with unlimited talented actors. Brought to us by one of my favourite directors in Ridley Scott we get to explore the Gucci family in all their glory. Ultimately we see the downfall of having a successful fashion brand; the target it puts on ones back and the dysfunctional family that comes from it. I particularly liked Jared Leto's performance as I felt he added a comedy element to the film, he was unrecognisable at times had I not known the cast beforehand. Lady Gaga has proved her worth as an actress as Patrizia Reggiani creating many layers and depth to her character. Firstly she displays integrity, is very stern, a lady with balls only to switch in contrast to an emotional damaged woman. Adam Driver gives a ruthless display in what originally seemed all charm and innocence. Al Pacino plays Aldo Gucci, my personal favourite actor had a lot more to do than I thought, he'd come across like the peacemaker. He'd wanted everybody to like him alongside Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo Gucci who are the backbone of Gucci. Although Rodolfo Gucci is much more cautious, he has his guard up in what he feels is in the best interest of the Gucci family. Jared Letto plays Paolo Gucci, Pacino' son constantly trying to seek the approval of his ideas from his father, but Pacino's character is not in the slight bit interest and sees his son as dim to say the least. Mauricio (Adam Driver) is studying to be a lawyer and is son of (Jeremy Irons) character Rodolfo Gucci. When Maurizio bumps into Patrizia (Lady Gaga) at a party, much like Paolo can't get his fathers approval; the juxtaposition of Maurizio (Adam Driver) trying to convince Rodolfo of his new girlfriend, soon bride to be is equally proving as difficult. I thought the story had good contrast in characters with a great cast that was needed to pull it off. It's nice to see some compelling story telling in the cinema for a change compared with the usual CGI led projects of today. I'd recommend giving this a watch in the cinema, it feels refreshing and it really shouldn't!",House of Gucci
156,60,sherylchilders82,"Aesthetically appealing, just like the brand",7/10,26 November 2021,"Artistic cinema with a story that takes patience and commitment, but is worth taking the time to enjoy. The mixed reviews are a result of a realistically portrayed tragedy, that is complicated and unsatisfying, as in real life. This makes it a true piece of art, rare in blockbuster form. Lady Gaga is brilliant, but I was most impressed with Adam Driver, who suspends your attention in his portrayal of Maurizio. This is not a glamorized story, but a true story of upper class people, which makes it seem more glamorous than it is. Which is perhaps why the tragedy seems so pronounced. These things simply do not happen to people like this, at least not very often. I think there is a lot to unravel in themes, depending on one's perspective, and I loved that.",House of Gucci

However, the rest of the movie is great. The rest of the actors are great (Lady Gaga and Adam Driver especially killed it), the story is fascinating, there are some funny moments, it's beautiful to look at, the costumes obviously are great, and the soundtrack is amazing.

Her Italian accent and over acting are laughable. In fact, there were more laughs at Lady Gaga overacting by the audience than at the humor in the movie. JARED LETO and JEREMY IRONS are remarkable in their roles and deserve Oscars as well as perhaps AL Pacino. Adam Driver seems miscast in his role as well but as the movie progressed, his character is fairly well acted by him as the spineless GUCCI who suddenly gets a ""spine"".For me, this is Ridley Scott's worst film. I am a fan of his work. But, this film leaves details unexplained. The soundtrack to many of the scenes just doesn't work for me. There are a multitude of scenes with people getting in or out of cars......too many.The only thing that makes this movie watchable is the story. The story is horrific.

169,73,tkmce2008,Lady Gaga & co. are fantastic in Ridely Scott's House of Gucci!,8/10,28 November 2021,"Ridley Scott's second movie (The Last Duel) of the year is another page to screen adaptation. Based on the book by the same name by Sara Gay Forden; the film follows the romantic relationship between Patrizia Reggiani & Maurizio Gucci that transforms into a battle for the control of the iconic fashion brand.Set between 1978 & 1995, The House of Gucci, introduces us to Patricia Reggiani, who is the daughter of trucking firm owner. She falls for Maurizio Gucci at a party and they get married against the wishes of his father. Patricia's entry into the Gucci family radically changes the dynamics between its members. What follows is a turbulent time for the fashion brand.Lady Gaga is star of the film. She is front and center and is responsible for most the events that transpire in the movie. The way she manipulates the Guccis is incredible. It is sad to see the fate of a family owned brand plummet but like they say; an outsider is needed for a new perspective.Jeremy Irons, plays Rodolfo Gucci the intolerant father to Maurizio. Al Pacino plays Aldo Gucci; brother to Rodolfo and the man behind all of Gucci's success. Adam Driver plays Maurizio Gucci, the eventual head of Gucci. And the most innocent of the lot; Paolo Gucci played by an unrecognisable Jared Leto. Leto & Pacino were my personal favourites from the film. The former's naivety & the latter's boisterous nature appealed to me.House of Gucci boasts of excellent production value with the Gucci family captured in all its glory. House of Gucci gives us an insider's view of all the family secrets and their ugly fight for power.The film is overlong at 157 minutes but it keeps you hooked with memorable performances; with Gaga assured at least a nomination if not a win at the Oscars next year.",House of Gucci
170,74,yzsnfcg,Fascinating.,9/10,26 November 2021,"Another brilliant Ridley Scott movie, incredible story that is amazing to think is an adaption from real life.

Looking forward to the Oscar's this year!

172,76,michaelschuddinck,"Not so good as I expected it to be, still very much enjoyable",7/10,29 November 2021,"I went with high expectations in this movie, which is often not a good idea... but we had a big set of amazing actors, the turbulent life of a fashion house and Ridley Scott directing. The pacing of the movie is great, but the intro is maybe too long, and the end a bit too short. I was awaiting more story in the end, what happened to Patrizia. The music was good, but a bit confusing to have disco tunes pumping on 80s-set scenes. Most of the acting performances were grand... Gaga and Driver play amazing character arches and developments during the entire movie. Some say Leto was a bit too much... maybe so, but it brought in some humor. Wasn't also a fan of the accents, or with some the lack of missing an accent. But overall it was camp, funny, I kept on being interested in the story and characters and had some amazing one-liners. I wouldn't say House of Gucci is the best movie of the year, but for sure not the worst... and keeps you entertained for 2.5h.

175,79,melwinbauer,Aesthetically pleasing but otherwise disappointing,6/10,27 November 2021,"House of Gucci is a distinctly average film with its flaws covered up by some good acting and pleasing aesthetics.The movie suffers from some poor pacing. The first hour or so is highly intriguing and you quickly become immersed in 70s Italy, but from there and onwards the story simply spirals downwards. The story becomes slow and lethargic and also slightly tedious.While leaving the cinema and speaking to other viewers a common critique was the usage of an italian accent among the characters when speaking english. In hindsight it was a bit odd but it did not take away from my viewing experience in the slightest.Where this movie shines is in its aesthetics. Ridley Scott does an incredible job in immersing the viewers in the late 1900s Italy with the picturesque sets and stunning fashion. Even as someone not all that interested in clothes and fashion, one couldn't help but watch the dashing clothes and styling in awe.Another positive to take away from this film is the acting. Lady Gaga comes through with another great performance and the supporting cast housing the likes of Adam Driver and Al Pacino also put on some great displays.To summarize House of Gucci is a movie which the fashion-interested will love and if a rather slow movie with a lack of action doesn't bother you, you might like it too. However to the average viewer I wouldn't go as far as to actively recommend this movie.",House of Gucci
176,80,freeway-6,"Yes, She Is Italian!",8/10,26 November 2021,"Who better than an Italian, Stefani Germanotta, aka Lady Gaga, to play Patrizia Reggiani, the enticing, social climbing, determined daughter of a small transportation company family in quest of a wealthy husband.Although there have been numerous critics here of her acting and of her accent--which is absolutely perfect, coming from this Italian reviewer--Miss Gaga's casting was genius on the part of Ridley Scott and his creative team. An Oscar nomination is likely.Much of the film was shot in Italy in the middle of the Covid lockdowns. Having just returned from Milan, I was thrilled to see a small portion of the magnificent Cathedral utilized for Patrizia and Maurizio's wedding, along with the equally beautiful adjacent shopping and dining arcade in the Piazza del Duomo.While the film's length is a major problem--judicious editing was definitely in order--much what is on screen is stunning to the eye...the Italian exteriors, the Manhattan exteriors, and the beautiful people that inhabit the world of design and fashion.Jeremy Irons plays the aristocratic Rodolfo Gucci flawlessly, Al Pacino does his usual Al Pacino as Rodolfo's brother Aldo, the controlling half of the Gucci family business. Adam Driver, who doesn't look very Italian, grows into the part of the heir apparent after Rudolfo's death.The big surprise is the totally unrecognizable Jared Leto as Paolo, the son of Pacino's Aldo. Viewed as a loser, he is at times both funny and sad, and ultimately a broken shell of a man. Also somewhat in disguise was Salma Hayek as a television fortune teller who Patrizia grows increasingly dependent upon for marriage advice.I did not find this film to be a comedy in any sense of the word. True there were funny lines and comical scenes, but in reality, House of Gucci was a tragedy. The end of a family dynasty, the corporate takeover and the resulting mass marketing of the major fashion and jewelry names.",House of Gucci
177,81,omegura,"A film with a great cast and potential, but terrible pacing",3/10,28 November 2021,"A great cast, beautiful environmental imagery, but a slow and messy story with very uneven time jumps and even worse pacing.This was something I wanted to see since the trailer was released. I love Lady Gaga and Adam Driver, so I was really excited to see them on screen.The beginning of the film started off strong, and was engaging, funny, and intimate, showing the beginning of Gaga and Driver's relationship.As the film continues, it began to drag on, and was filled with awkward time jumps and pacing that made the timeline of the events taking place really distracting and messy.The time jumps messed with the continuity of the film too. I felt like the events taking place were years and years ahead, but at the end, we were told that the events took place long in the past.It was hard keeping up with the story, and the slowness slowly made me lose interest. The finale was also really quick, bland, and predictable, for a few reasons.One, the finale was spoiled in the first shot of the film, and was really really obvious from the get-go, so when the film gets to the story building up to it, it tries to engage you but fails miserably.Therefore, when the finale happens, it just happens and that's it.Only good thing I can say is the cinematography. The cinematography takes advantage of the environment and weather to add depth and beauty into every frame.Overall a really bland and slow film that leaves you sitting in your seat bored for almost 3 hours.",House of Gucci

179,83,FernandoRainer,"A well-tempered film, with some good mixes and some too pungent.",8/10,28 November 2021,"It is clear the progress that the acting of Lady Gaga has made, of course it is always possible to improve in one aspect or another, but yes, we can consider Lady Gaga an actress who overshadows landscapes. The actress is unforgettable and overflows with personality, sometimes exaggerated, but just the right measure for a film that is extravagant from beginning to end, in short, she fulfilled her role very well and committed one hundred percent.It's unavoidable to start talking about the great diva Lady Gaga, but now, getting right down to business I say, the movie is exaggerated, and how can it not be? They are divine clothing models, dressed by dramatic and exuberant characters, in scenarios full of exorbitant scenes. The film fulfilled her role, told her story amid an outrageous controversy from the Gucci fashion world.The film made me laugh in several scenes, sometimes it was difficult even to take it seriously, maybe that would be the intention, as it is a film full of characters and peculiar scenes. Despite his impeccable aesthetics, cuts and direction, he could have focused more on deepening each character, thus developing and reaffirming the essence of the narrative in its entirety, I repeat, this I missed, thus leaving the story with a TV news feel, or even from a soap opera, but in any case the film fulfills the understanding of its history, events and dated facts as stated.",House of Gucci

After seeing the movie, I decided to know the real story and I can say that the movie is not exaggerated in any way.Ridley Scott has done an amazing job of which I can only point out one criticism - the choice of Lady Gaga for the role of Patrizia Reggiani. In my opinion, Lady Gaga's meager training as an actress gains a huge dimension in films of this kind. Not even the role of noisy Italian made her shine, I think one should stick to music movies...So great story, spectacular cinematography but poor choice of actress.

181,85,loveasklin,Impressive visuals but underwhelming conclusion,7/10,27 November 2021,"""House of Gucci"" is a beautifully shot picture with great people involved. It is somewhat underwhelming and a tad too long, but there are great moments sprinkled throughout the movie.The film is based on the real murder of Maurizio Gucci and the downfall of the Gucci family. It all begins when Patrizia Reggiani marries into the Gucci family and the rest is history.Lady Gaga is great as the ambitious Patrizia Reggiani but she is also inconsistent with her performance. Pacino, Driver and Leto are good per usual. It is however a daring choice by the filmmakers to have the actors speak in English with an Italian accent. It is not a huge problem, but it does occasionally take the viewer out of the experience.The first forty minutes of the movie are great. The characters are well introduced, and the plot is intriguing. The rest of the movie does not maintain this standard. The last 30 minutes are beyond underwhelming and the climax is cold and emotionless.There are issues with ""House of Gucci"" but the production design is not one of them. The film is beautifully shot and the locations look great. ""House of Gucci"" is very stylish and the costume department really outdid themselves.With everything said, ""House of Gucci"" is a decent film with outstanding visuals and great acting. If you like fashion, then you should give this movie a watch. It is beautiful and quite enjoyable despite its excessive runtime.",House of Gucci
182,86,Mr-Topshotta,"""HOUSE OF GUCCI"" REVIEW",8/10,26 November 2021,"""HOUSE OF GUCCI"" REVIEWDirected by Ridley Scott. Starring Adam Driver as ""Maurizio Gucci"" and Lady Gaga playing ""Patrizia Reggiani"". Who would eventually become ""Maurizio's"" wife. This is the true story of the iconic fashion brand ""Gucci"". This film is about the family of ""Gucci's"" and how a woman ""Patrizia"" maneuvered her way into a family looking for a pay day. Once achieving the ultimate goal (financial stability) it shows how greed, Deceit, revenge and madness that Ultimately resulted in the unthinkable tore this family apart. With ""Patrizia""being the main reason why.With a call sheet of A list actors showing off how phenomenal their GOD given talents are. From Al Pacino playing ""Aldo Gucci"", Jeremy Irons playing ""Rodolfo Gucci"", Jared Leto who was Unrecognizable playing ""Paola Gucci"", Salma Hayek who we just saw in ""ETERNALS"" playing ""Pina Auriemma"" and Jack Huston playing ""Domenico De Sole"" who we all might remember from ""Board Walk Empire"" as ""Richard Harrow""(Nucky faceless Assassin).It's crazy all this madness took place because a beautiful woman saw a nerdy rich guy that didn't know his own worth. She played a Strategic game to set herself up for life. The only problem, well one of the many I should say is that ""Patrizia"" even though she was smart, pretty and cunning. All those traits were equally matched with how crazy she was. She saw a water fountain of
Power and wealth and refused to stop drinking from it.I didn't know the back history at all about Gucci so it was cool learning about it all. I thought it was cool seeing some of the adversity the company went through. Seeing a young Anna Wintour was cool. I enjoyed seeing a young Tom Ford portrayed, while learning about his involvement in Gucci.Lady Gaga, and the whole cast Immersed themselves in their characters. Jared Leto being unrecognizable with the hair and makeup. Mixed with all the actors using Italian accents. All of them could win an Oscar. Lady Gaga like Will Smith coming from music is having an amazing acting career. I think she will win another Oscar for leading Female. If I had to compare ""King Ricard"" with ""The House of Gucci"" yet drastically different but still a autobiography I still think ""King Richard"" should win best picture at the Oscar's, with Will Smith winning best leading male.The only real critique I can give about this film, is it's a little long. But overall director Ridley Scott has given us some great pieces of cinema this year. Also I don't know what it is but man the fashion industry is dangerous. With Versace, Von Dutch, and Gucci to name a few. You wouldn't think about fashion being deadly but it definitely can be.I hate that Bob Ross, Gucci and the countless others all have the same thing in common. The family members with the actual last name, that started that company has no involvement with the company. They always get cut out some how. So all those millions go some where or to someone else. It's sad when you think about it. The acting is top notch in ""House of Gucci"" its five more fires quality acting. The movie as a whole though I give four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥

183,87,alanramirez1,The amazing cast saves a very flawed movie,7/10,25 November 2021,"I was really looking forward to this movie as after Gaga's amazing performance in A Star is Born I was really eager to see her future performances.House of Gucci has good things and bad things, let's start with the positive things:
1. Lady Gaga's performance as Patrizia Reggiani is wonderful. She's an amazing actress, her expressions, accent and mannerisms were on point. It sure feels like she did her research very well because she always seemed really on character and she was always 100% believable. She was a delight to watch on screen and should be able to get nominated for the Oscars and Golden Globes.2. Salma Hayek and Jared Leto do an amazing job as supporting actors and even though their talent is mainly used (and to be honest a little wasted) to be the comedic reliefs, they are entertaining to watch on screen and they will keep you entertained. The movie's comedy is always on point and well-done.3. The costumes don't disappoint. All the looks but especially (of course) Gaga's and Adam Driver's looks are always amazing and really great to look out.4. The story, even though it's told with several plotholes and several things explained in a poor way manages to entertain you through the almost 3-hour length.Now with the negative aspects.1. The length of the movie is really unnecessary. I feel like they could have done a better job making it a little shorter, the editing is not that good. A lot of scenes could have been deleted and I don't think anything would have really changed as the pace is really bad. Some acts of the movie are really long and others feel so rushed and this is the kind of movie that needs your whole attention at all times, otherwise you will be lost and asking what just happened.2. I feel like they left out several key moments of the story. I'm happy I knew the whole story before watching the movie, because if you don't know it you won't really know how some things happened as the movie does a bad job explaining (or totally avoiding) several key moments. For example I would have loved to see the aftermath of what happened after Maurizio was shot. I found the ending very rushed. It would had been awesome to see the police investigating and realizing that Patrizia was behind everything. The ending feels very meh because you don't get to see anything of that. Really hoping they shot some of that and they include it as deleted scenes on the Blu Ray release.Overall I do think House of Gucci is enjoyable but the amazing cast saves the movie more than once because the pace and editing are bad. I managed to be entertained the whole time but I feel like the regular moviegoer will find it very long and boring.",House of Gucci
184,88,pedroautreto,The most weird Italian accent ever made,7/10,28 November 2021,"In 21th century and we watch a story about Italy spoken in English. That is weird. What is terrible is that actors try to mimic a sadly horrible Italian accent. We have a lot of examples about really nice movies spoken in other languages than English. Netflix, hbomax ... come on Hollywood.I give 7 stars because of Lady Gaga! Fantastic! She is what we can get of the best in this movie. Congratulations.

Leto was hard to recognize and was endearing as a character.The pacing of the film was slow and details were lost. Did I care about the main characters? No.So, meh.

186,90,DownBrush,How did it go so wrong?,4/10,27 November 2021,"This movie has enough things to be amazing, a spectacular cast and a great director, but it turns out to be a huge disappointment. The cast does their job, nothing particularly amazing but it definetly still is the highlight of the film, but what is so bad about it then....? THE WRITING, whoever wrote this movie should not get any more jobs in the film industry unless they change something. It is the longest 150 minute movie I have witnessed in my life, it felt like an eternity in the cinema. The writers have taken a very interesting topic without any success. The screenplay feels like it has come out of that one whispering game where someone whispers a sentence and then everyone whispers to the person on their right in a circle until you have a final sentence. This story feels like the final sentence compared to the true events.

187,91,asteroisa,Was a 7/10 but,6/10,25 November 2021,"When I went home I searched the Gucci family member story and pretty much nothing from the movie happened irl and I wonder why. Did all the budget go to Gaga and not to her supposed second daughter with Maurizio or Aldo's other kids ?Besides that, the movie had too many messy time jumps and awkward scenes. On top of that it was a little too long but had some great acting and score.

188,92,vladsedyh,One time watch.,6/10,24 November 2021,"Did not have high expectations, maybe just some because of the cast, budget and director attached. Film turned out to be silly. People speak with grotesque Italian accents, and it looks or sounds even more weird when you hear a British Italian accent versus American English Italian accent. It throws off right away, thank god they did not gesture a lot in this film, other wise it would have been way too caricatured.Second comment is that the story is not unfold fully. Feels like some moments were rushed, especially in the first part. Because of this, you I did not connect to the characters well enough, and for the rest of the film I did not care what was to happen to them. The story overall is not very catching, but it least it's based on true events, so you can write it off.Thirdly, the whole Gucci aesthetic was not showed enough. You would think this film would contain fashion elements, luxury, big money, but from the set design standpoint it looked pretty regularly. This film could be as well about any other family that had inner mind games. It felt like the production did not exploit the theme of Gucci well enough.I guess this is it. It's not the film I would rewatch, but it was worth just this one time while snacking and sipping a drink.",House of Gucci
189,93,akdjreview,Disappointing star-studded cast,6/10,27 November 2021,"House of Gucci was incredibly disappointing but not worthless. With incredible actors that all almost failed to perform. Nevertheless, it was beautifully shot and capitalized on the classic Italian style.I got the feeling that the movie mostly played on the name Gucci to rush a story to get famous and make money. You can't say much more about the story since it's mostly based on facts. But they used many stories from Maurizio Gucci's life that were unnecessary from a movie perspective and served no purpose for the story.The choice of language in the film was also disturbingly odd. All characters spoke English which in itself is weird when most of the film is set in Italy. Even so, the characters suddenly also spoke Italian in strange situations. All the characters also used an incredibly strange Italian accent that wasn't fitting at all. Meanwhile, some were so bad you could tell they were American.As previously stated the movie was beautifully shot, but that was pretty much all it had going. I'd also say every single actor had surprisingly bad performances which were disappointing.Overall not that good of a movie. I don't recommend it if you're not a huge fan of Gucci or the actors.",House of Gucci
190,94,gjgmwr,Overstuffed,6/10,28 November 2021,"A movie which just extends on forever, especially towards the end, dragging itself on with seemingly unnecessary details.Visually appealing, and unlike most people are saying, I don't think anyone in the cast was particularly bad, although no one was excellent either.The ending was undramatically raw, and unfortunately I don't mean this to be good.Overall, despite Adam Driver's, I am awkward type charm, the beautiful scenarios and the fake Italian accent, 6/10 is a fair rating.

192,96,dukereel,Now THIS is the purpose of a biographical film! So damn juicy and interesting!,9/10,26 November 2021,"TAKEAWAYS:1. The evolution and consequence of the seven deadly sins, patriarchy, and power-this is one key theme of this film that had a pretty solid follow through.It takes a little moment to take shape in Act One when following our lead character, played by Gaga; and even then it's mainly stated vs seen by ""father Gucci"" himself to his son, played by Driver. However, the quick focus on the Gucci family is what saves Act One's role in setting the theme in motion because the family itself is the theme.Act Two is all about Gaga's character being slowly immersed in the Gucci environment. We see her go from sampling the family lifestyle with a ""forced / testing"" humility, to taking advantage of the all you can have buffet, thus becoming a replica of them / the theme. Then, while this is happening, we see the patriarchy and power aspects of the theme emerge in response.Act Three is the collision of the theme on all characters involved.2. As my friend said, ""AND YOU SUGGESTED YO MAN FOR THE SHOW!"" That last lunch meeting in Act Three...3. But the outfits, though...4. When I tell you, Father Gucci was SO shady... #TheTriumphOfMediocrity5. House of Gucci tells the origin story of the now global luxury fashion line. I learned SO much from this film, and it was so juicy while also being effective in its execution.This film definitely holds true to its title, and the each act ensures we get the understanding, legacy, beliefs, and motivations of this family as it relates to the theme. Act One wastes no time with us being able to get a glimpse of both Gaga's character as well as the Gucci family separately, and then together. I also appreciated the slow merge with the 1-1 (Gaga and Driver) to then 2-1 (Gaga & Drive with father), and finally the blending of the families.Act Two is the complete dive into the Gucci family mainly through the lens of Gaga's character and her steering of the theme, and then Act Three... another perspective of ""when in Rome...""6. Personally, I found the pacing to be solid. Act One quickly gets Gaga into this family without it feeling rushed. Act Two is just a fun and scandalous pacing via Gaga with every convo, move, and visual feeling intentional and perfectly timed by frame.Act Three is where the debris from Act Two gets it juicy. A friend of mine who was with me felt the pacing started to slow down a bit at this point (he also was on his second glass of theater wine...lol), and I felt the start of Act Three move a little differently after going through Act Two, but it was brief and necessary to me. It wasn't long before the act picks up steam again. It was like driving on an open highway, then coming to that random short stretch of 2 lanes becoming 1 due to construction, but once you go through it you're back to speeding again...7. I didn't think seeing Salma and Gaga together would be one of the most entertaining duos on screen.8. When Gaga spoke to Franco about trying to teacher her child to not touch other people's stuff...9. ""You can call me Señora Gucci..."" #Periodt10. I adored every character performance, and every character carried the weight of the theme in their own way. I really enjoyed Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci who seems to be someone who embodied this internal battle of the virtue patience with the sin of envy and wrath, even though at times it felt like he was having a keekee session / queening out with Gaga (but I blame the chemistry and not him, which is also a good thing).Father Gucci who was the epitome vainglory. Uncle Aldo who embodied a form of gluttony and sloth-ness. Maurizio Gucci who had an amazing arc from embodying this virtue of humility to having aspects of his family rub off on him eventually. And then we have Gaga's character, Patrizia.Her arc and development was the strongest in acts 2 and 3-seeing this greed, vainglory, and wrath mold together. BUT...Act One doesn't explain much about her motivation. How the seed was planted. We do get this ""lust"" aspect from her, but again... why based on her life-context at the time...* * *
Overall #HouseOfGucci gives The Eyes of Tammy Faye - meets The Crown - meets The Addams Family - meets the Candy Mossler storyThis is one fun, scandalous, and messy (in a gay, juicy way) ass biographical story. That's it. That's all.SN: I would LOVE to see my girl who does the make-up and crime stories on FB tell the summary of this story in her way.",House of Gucci
193,0,MartinHafer,"A big improvement over the first film, but it still doesn't quite hit the mark.",7/10,16 November 2021,"""Dune"" is a great book and it, along with its sequels, are compelling reading. However, they are NOT short nor light reading and to make a decent version of the first book, it's hard to imagine doing anything other than making a mini-series. This was one of several reasons why I hated the David Lynch version from 1984. It crammed so much stuff into such a short film that it often was confusing....and the director himself hated the film. Apparently, the studio took the movie away from him and hacked it to pieces...thus making it so confusing. Because of this, I was not interested in seeing this 2021 version....until I learned it was only part one and the second film would complete the first ""Dune"" book.So, from the outset, this film can't help but be better than the 1984 version. BUT, it manages to do something I didn't expect...it's actually TOO long...or so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candy...along with very moody music. In many ways, it reminded me of the first ""Star Trek"" movie...which was so long and tedious...and had too many scenes where you just see a ship flying through space! And, in ""Dune: Part One"" there are too many scenes like this and not enough emotion and dialog. In other words, it seems to need a more personal and human tough to make it a truly great film. Now I am not saying it's bad or to avoid it. But the film could have been tightened up a bit and paced better.Fortunately, if you have never read ""Dune"", this film is approachable and does follow the book closely.",Dune
194,1,SnoopyStyle,Villeneuve epic,8/10,21 October 2021,"Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.",Dune
195,2,Hitchcoc,The Beginning,8/10,22 October 2021,"Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.

196,3,Horst_In_Translation,"If this film was a planet, then it could be fine for temporary stay, permanent not really though",6/10,26 September 2021,"""Dune"" is a really new American movie from 2021 that just got released and I saw that people really liked it, so I got curious and decided to check it out myself. It is a pretty long movie at slightly under 2.5 hours and the director is Denis Villeneuve, perhaps one of the most influential filmmakers right now and maybe number one from Canada. He is also one of the writers and the writing staff also includes an Oscar winner. You can check out the names there yourself. I shall instead elaborate a little more on the cast. Villeneuve being in charge resulted in many big names becoming a part of this project. The lead actor here is Timothée Chalamet, definitely a rising star, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of him really. This is a bit of a problem as he is basically in this movie from beginning to end, but luckily, the supporting cast includes more than a handful actors that I like quite a bit. These would be Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. With Brolin and Bardem, it felt like a bit of a reunion from No Country for Old Men, especially during the one brief scene/moment in which they clash to some extent. And as we are already talking Coen Bros movies, Isaac's Inside Llewyn Davis deserves a mention as well for sure. So you will find a few actors in here who have worked with the maybe most famous filmmaking brothers duo in the past. Brolin is featured heavily in the first half of the film, but then vanishes completely. Isaac also has more screen time early on. Bardem has a brief scene when his character is introduced, but appears in the last 30 minutes again. I personally thought that he would not show up again with this film, but play a central role in the second movie. Yes, there is a sequel indeed. This already becomes clear when this film here starts as we see a ""part one"" or something and also the way this one ends makes it very obvious that this is not it.As for the rest of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson is almost lead as well, which was okay. Zendaya I am still not buying the hype and she is only really in it near the end. Momoa is on the good side, while Skarsgard and Bautista are on the enemy team. The latter is really making himself a career now if you take a look at everything he has been in, even if it is always supporting parts. His recognition value probably helps as well. Oh yeah, Charlotte Rampling also has a memorable scene in here. I will get to that/her later. Of course, people will immediately think of the David Lynch Dune movie from decades earlier. I will not talk about parallels or differences now with that one because I have not seen it. Let's just focus on this one here instead from a standalone perspective. There is enough to elaborate on anyway. I must still say that I struggle with seeing Chalamet as some kind of hero or chosen character. I don' think he has the props to really pull it off. Of course, this is the idea that he does not look like Hulk or Thor or something, but when I see him show his dedication like how he really wants to join Momoa's character or how he can defeat Brolin's character in a duel or how he leads his mother in the desert and knows exactly how his items and uniform work because he is such a natural or how he in the end says his path leads through the desert, it is difficult to believe. Also how he of course wins the battle against this fella near the end who challenges him. And he has to kill in the process, which also shows us how much of a kindred spirit he is that he has never killed somebody before.Death is a crucial component in here. Still I must say seeing how literally every single good guy, be it Isaac's character, be it Momoa's, be it the seer, goes out in a heroic manner that puts harm to the enemy side was a bit much and eventually also repetitive. There were other issues I struggled with here in terms of the plot. Take a look at the idea of Chalamet's character playing a real hero. Basically he is the future. And yet, his own folk (Rampling's character) were ready to kill him immediately with this poisonous needle if he pulls out his hand from this box that caused so much pain to him. Or his dreams and premonitions linked to Zendaya's character were also not exactly new or inspired the way they were put on display here. I could go on by saying that for example the introduction did feel too long and this movie could have been (or should have been) half an hour shorter perhaps. What I cannot say anything negative about is really the way in which the bad guys attack. When they come for Isaac's character and the others, it is really spectacular and this is when this film is at its very best and an incredibly tense thrill ride. In the middle of the film. Unfortunately, when this is over and the bad guys have won for the moment, it gets a bit weaker again and here and there it drags a bit and has some lengths. What also can be said is that this film is never really intended for comedic purpose. The way you could see it a lot on another Bautista fantasy/sci-fi movie. There was this one moment when Momoa's character talks about Chalamet's character's muscles that was a bit on the playful comedic site and maybe one or two other inclusions as the film went on, but yeah this is not a movie to pick for light relief or something. It takes itself very seriously. Does it have the right to? I am not sure.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sets, cinematography, costumes and all other visual/audible production fields, but this is pretty much a given now with a film of this dimension, even if we maybe should not see it as a given. With the likes of Zimmer, Roberts and West in charge, however, there is at least as much competence available in ""minor"" departments as there is in front of the camera. If not more. But back to the action itself: With the spectacular visuals, this is definitely a movie you'd rather want to check out at a theater than at home on a small screen. Unless you have a home theater of course. Oh yeah, another moment that will maybe make you smile is how Isaac's character tries to get Brolin's grumpy character to smile really early on. The latter reminds me a bit of the man Brolin played on Sicario. Anyway, I guess we will see more from Brolin's character in the sequel here as well. As for Villeneuve, I must say I liked his earlier stuff like Prisoners, but his recent take on Blade Runner did almost nothing for me unfortunately. Quality-wise, this movie here is somewhere in-between. It's not a revelation or anything and I think the reception is way too positive (I even saw people consider Chalamet for an Oscar nomination, like come on!), but it is worth seeing if you like the genre and some of the cast members I suppose. Not a must-see by any definition though. Seems as if Villeneuve really enjoys giving us his take on some films that are considered classics. It certainly could have turned out worse here, but I hope that with whatever he does in the future, also after this sequel here, he can manage to be a bit more essential again. The pathos felt a bit much at times and did not always ring true. This maybe also could have had to do with Chalamet for me though. If you like him more, you will maybe not see it.The attention to detail at times was still pretty good. I liked Brolin's words during the training sequence linked to Chalamet's character expressing he is not in the mood for fighting or so and how he has to fight when the time is right and how this felt connected to his battle with one character near the end. Completely aside from that, I initially struggled with the sand component, but in the second half they turned the background and location into something special and you could feel the endless desert element finally. Also the idea of these sandworms was depicted nicely. Or how a ring is used to print a seal or signature. Or these helicopters that look like insects. Or the little drone, so it is not just the big spectacular inclusions where you can see all the talent that was included in the making of this film. Unfortunately, there were also many struggles. I mentioned most of them, but while I already stated that the introduction felt too long, the real introduction at the very start felt incredibly rushed and it was impossible to remember all they mentioned there. Pretty much a no-go for a film with this running time. All in all, I still give it a thumbs-up and I think the good is more frequent than the weak, but there's no way I would say that this is among the very best films of the year 2021 so far. Maybe the better, but not the best and I hope that Villeneuve can step things up with the second film, but given the lead actor I kinda doubt it. Anyway, if you like this one, you can probably keep watching. Maybe said sequel is out already once you read this review of mine and then you can decide for yourself anyway. (tt1160419)",Dune

199,6,classicsoncall,"""He shall know your ways as though born to them.""",9/10,22 October 2021,"It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.",Dune

It's an impressive movie. Not just the visuals, but in the story's complexity. Timothée Chalamet continues to reaffirm himself as one of the greatest actors of his generation.I'm eager to see part 2, as well as David Lynch's adaptation.

201,8,jboothmillard,Dune,7/10,1 November 2021,"The 1984 David Lynch movie was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews over the years, but the trailer for the new movie, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, looked like it would be much better, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, in the known universe, Duke Leto of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune. It is the universe's only source of the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice is also critical for safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, who threaten Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet, and an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is part of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female order with advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter to descend and become the Kwisatz Haderach (""one who can be many places at once""), she instead gave birth to a son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul has been trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul talks to Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions he has had of the future. Due to these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a deadly test. He is subjected to experience excruciating pain to his hand, to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Later, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to not kill Paul and Jessica during his coup. He agrees not to harm them but intends to cause their deaths indirectly to end their bloodline. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, capital city and fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan and an advance party have been learning about the world and the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist and imperial judge Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). Kynes explains the dangers of spice harvesting to Leto, Paul, and Halleck, including the giant sandworms. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching an active spice harvester with a stranded crew. Leto and his team rescue the workers moments before the sandworm swallows it. Paul's exposure to spice-laden air triggers intense premonitions. Following an attempt by a Harkonnen agent to kill Paul, Leto's soldiers are put on high alert. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) disables Arrakeen's critical protective shields, allowing Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal with the Baron to deliver him in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh poisons Leto with a gas capsule and is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing himself and members of the Baron's court, but the Baron survives. Duncan escapes and steals an ornithopter (an aircraft with rapidly flapping wings). Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica and intend to drop them in the desert to perish. Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors using a Bene Gesserit power called ""The Voice"" to control others verbally. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent. Paul experiences visions of a ""holy war"" spreading across the universe and him leading it. The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban aka ""Beast"" (Dave Bautista) and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart production to recover the cost of the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes and head to an old research station but are soon tracked down by Sardaukar. Jessica, Paul and Kynes are allowed to escape the facility when Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves. Kynes, ambushed by Sardaukar troops, lures a sandworm that devours them along with her. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them are Stilgar and young warrior Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has seen in his visions. Their admission into the tribe is protested by Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), so they have a ritual duel to the death, and Paul is victorious. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul states they will remain on Arrakis with the Fremen to reclaim the planet. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries, Benjamin Clémentine as Herald of the Change, Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes, and Roger Yuan as Lieutenant Lanville. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet makes for a good young hero, Skarsgård is good at being the nasty and grotesque villain, and the all-star cast, including Isaac, Brolin, Rampling, Zendaya, and Bardem all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the second part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure. Very good!",Dune
202,9,paul_haakonsen,"Visually impressive, but rather unnecessary remake...",6/10,18 October 2021,"Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story ""Dune"". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of ""Dune"", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then ""Dune"" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then ""Dune"" doesn't disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timothée Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of ""Dune"" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgård on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsgård in the movie.And while ""Dune"" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to ""will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch ""Dune"", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of ""Dune"" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade.",Dune
203,10,CinemaSerf,Classic and sophisticated sci-fi at it's best.,7/10,25 October 2021,"Fans of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) might recognise the bleak scenery around Wadi Rum, one of many stunningly beautiful and evocative locations used is this epic piece of cinema. It is that photography, and another hugely complimentary score from Hans Zimmer, that perfectly sets the template for this adaptation of Frank Herbert's story of family, avarice and power. I was sceptical about it being split into two parts (especially given the lengthy delay between this and the sequel) but it really works well. The unseen Emperor of the Known Universe commands that house ""Atreides"" take over the mining of the valuable ""spice"" from their arch enemy the ""Harkonnen"", and so the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his wife ""Jessica"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and son ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) must prepare to relocate to their new and distinctly hostile desert world. It is clear from the outset that young man is troubled. He sleeps fitfully with strange dreams all set upon a planet he has studied but never visited. Upon arrival, they are betrayed and the young man and his mother must find and befriend the local ""Fremen"" population and learn how to survive and to fight back. Now I won't fib, it does drag a bit at times, and if you already know the story from either the book, or the David Lynch version from 1984, then that can lead to you wanting to shout ""get on with it"" at the big screen, but being patient with this brings it's own rewards. The attention to the detail, and the grand scale of this feature is immersive, it draws you in and there is enough action, and food-for-thought to sustain that interest for the most part. Chalamet offers us a strong and engaging performance. He is growing as an actor, maturing - and though he still looks like a decent meal would kill him, he owns the picture in a way (for me, anyway) that he never has before. The remaining cast members gel well together, and the mysticism and political manoeuvring that underpins this story is subtle and nuanced but potent in it's presentation. The costumes and visual effects are splendid - I want one of the locust-copters (though heaven only knows what the vibrations must be like onboard!), and we do get a sense - but really only that - of the enormity of the giant worms that patrol the desert looking for their quarry. The second part of the novel was always the more interesting. We will see the characters develop more, and we will learn more of the troubled ""Paul"" and of whom he really is - as well as there being much more actually going on. If this is the standard of the opening gambit, then what is to come ought to be wonderful.",Dune
204,11,zardoz-13,Villeneuve's Greatest Sci-Fi Film,10/10,29 October 2021,"Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel ""Dune"" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled ""Dune"" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before ""Dune"" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, ""Dune"" never degenerates into a juvenile ""Buck Rogers"" space opera. ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timothée Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, ""Dune"" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of ""Star Wars"" and ""Game of Thrones,"" and you'll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, ""Dune"" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård of ""Good Will Hunting"") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of ""Ex-Machina"") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Doctor Sleep"") and their teenage son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet of ""Lady Bird""), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of ""Sicario""), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of ""Aquaman""), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul's dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto's palace topples his rule, and the Baron's soldiers annihilate Atreides' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between ""Dune"" and ""Star Wars"" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, ""Dune"" takes itself far more seriously than ""Star Wars."" When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. ""Dune"" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and ""Prometheus"" writer Jon Spaihts and ""A Star Is Born"" scripter Eric Roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, ""Dune"" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom.",Dune
205,12,evanston_dad,"Lifeless, Emotionless, and Dull",4/10,8 November 2021,"At the very end of ""Dune,"" Denis Villeneuve's attempt to make a screen version of the novel that isn't a disaster, a character says, ""This is only the beginning."" The line is meant to be an enticing promise of what's yet to come. To me it sounded like a threat. I knew this was only the first of a two-part movie, and yet this bit of news still managed to be one of the most demoralizing things I've heard in a long time.The creators of ""Dune"" clearly love the source material and have attempted to make something true to it with much care and love. But they've somehow still managed to make a lifeless, dramatically inert bungle of it. I didn't feel a single thing during this nearly three-hour movie, except the urge to pee, which I knew would happen given the size of the Modelo I bought at the concession. Seriously, you should have seen this Modelo. I paid $13 dollars for it, which was almost as much as the amount I paid for the movie ticket and parking combined. At first I was astounded, but then I saw the can they were handing to me. It was like I got my own personal keg of beer. This is the first time I've ever had a movie end and realize that I still had beer to drink, which I chugged during the closing credits.Wait...did I wander away from the subject of ""Dune?"" That's because the story of my beer is more interesting than this movie. Have you ever seen the musical ""Urinetown?"" If you have, you know that there's a song at the beginning about how the characters don't want to overload the audience with too much exposition right off the bat. The creators of ""Dune"" should have watched ""Urinetown."" This movie is nothing but exposition. We have to have someone explaining something to us in every scene. At one point, there's even a five minute scene where one character literally tells the other characters how their suits work. It's like a mechanic explaining to you how a car engine works when you're not that into cars. There's an audience for it, but I'm not it.One brown, ponderous scene follows another, while Hans Zimmer's screeching score drones on and on. At first it was just there, but by the end of the movie the music had me wanting to climb the walls. It becomes a parody of itself. By the time a bunch of female vocalists came on the soundtrack wailing in something resembling a Middle Eastern way, I had decided that this might be one of the worst scores Zimmer has ever composed.The movie never changes tone. I mean never. It never changes pace. I mean never. I suppose during some action scenes the editing literally gets faster, but the scenes still somehow manage to remain lifeless and unexciting. I never felt a sense of adventure, which is odd for a movie about a young man who gets the opportunity to leave his home planet and experience something new. I never cared about anything. None of the actors seem to be having any fun being in this movie. Timothee Chalamet is pretty as a postcard, but he has exactly one facial expression. Oscar Isaac is in this. So is Jason Mamoa. So is Josh Brolin. So is Javier Bardem. Lots of good talent. All of it swamped by colorless production design.This is the kind of movie with rabid fans who will tell you that there's something wrong with you for not liking it. I can just hear them saying things like ""Stick to 'The Fast and the Furious' you nincompoops who are too stupid to understand such profound things as 'Dune',"" as if they have any idea who I am or what my movie tastes are. Let those people get their knickers in a twist, and let those who also thought this movie was a boring slog join me for a keg-sized Modelo. Cheers!Grade: C-",Dune
206,13,neil-476,At last,8/10,26 October 2021,"Spice, a substance mined only from the deserts of planet Arrakis, is the most valuable commodity in the galaxies since it enables interstellar transport. The violent and sadistic Harkonnen family have help the spice mining franchise for 40 years, becoming immensely wealthy in the process, alienating Arrakis natives the Fremen in the process. The Emperor abruptly appoints the Atreides family instead, infuriating the Harkonnens who sabotage equipment left behind, and plan a violent takeback. This results in heir apparent Paul Atreides and mother Jessica being abandoned in the desert, where they need to fall in with desert experts the Fremen in order to survive. Trouble is, after 40 years of the Harkonnens, the Fremen aren't very keen on offworlders.And.... end of part one. We are halfway through the story, with a part two which may never be greenlit if box office doesn't justify it which, in this post-covid world sounds somewhat unlikely. So what's part one like?My history of Dune and director Denis Villeneuve meant I was not hopeful. I read the novel in my teens in the 1960s and found it dense and impenetrable. David Lynch's movie had its moments, but got hacked about by the studio. The later TV series was more lucid, but suffered from some really poor casting and acting. And I had problems with Glade Runner 2049 and Arrival, both of which were a bit too cerebral for me, and less clear than I would have liked from a narrative stanndpoint.Dune (part one) 2021 is a fine film. It looks amazing, which one would expect these days. The casting - and acting - is excellent. And the script/adaptation is first rate. The power games which underlie the main plot are clear and obvious, the interplay of character dynamics is solid, subtle story points come through, all the little bits you need to understand are explained organically without huge obvious information dumps, and the story flows easily throughout the two and a half hours.I have two reservations. One, the film isn't as significant as it sometimes seems to think it is. And, two, Hans Zimmer's score is dissonant, intrusive and aggressive and I actively disliked it.But I liked the film very much, and I greatly hope there will be a part two.",Dune
207,14,ferguson-6,stunning visuals,7/10,21 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been nearly 40 years since David Lynch directed DUNE (1984). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, and has since been a cult favorite, though not one I'm particularly drawn to. All these years later, Frank Herbert's 1965 novel (there are 5 sequel novels) has been re-made by acclaimed writer-director Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, 2016) and his co-writers Eric Roth (Oscar winner, FORREST GUMP, 1994) and Joe Spaihts (PROMETHEUS, 2012). The new version looks absolutely fantastic, even if the story is a bit convoluted and the characters don't always make the best, or even logical, decisions.The year is 10191, likely the most futuristic movie we've seen. Oscar Isaac is Duke Letto Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica Atreides, though the story mostly focuses on the son, Paul, played by Timothy Chalamet. The story revolves around the protection of spice, the most valuable resource in the universe/galaxy. However the real focus is on politics and power plays ... so I guess not much really changes over the next 8170 years - except, of course, the colonization and travel between multiple planets (surprisingly, none of these planets is named Elon or Bezos). There is much talk of ""the plan"" with emphasis on whether young Paul is ""the one"" mentioned in their legends. Paul does have some special abilities, but Chalamet's understated (and mostly monotone) portrayal makes everyone, even Lady Jessica, a bit unsure of whether he's the leader they need.The supporting cast is impressive and all do their part to drive the action and story forward. Jason Mamoa is Duncan Idaho, the warrior who humorously belittles Paul's fragile physical frame. Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, the bodyguard to the noble family, and Charlotte Rampling plays the Reverend Mother (a creepy nun). Oscar winner Javier Bardem is under-utilized as Stilgar, while Zendaya shines as Chani, one who bonds with Paul. Of course the most outrageous role finds Stellan Skarsgard (with some heavy make-up and special effects) as the grand emperor of Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista as his brother, the Beast.For me, the movie's technical aspects are what stand out. It deserves awards consideration in multiple categories, especially Sound, Visual Effects, Cinematography, and Score. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer really delivers a score that compliments and enhances what we see on screen. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has been involved in numerous high profile projects, like ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) and the highly anticipated THE BATMAN (coming in 2022). The effects are special and include the sandworms, as well as dragonfly choppers that are quite impressive. It was a bit annoying to see the desert sand blowing constantly, yet goggles and masks are hardly ever used. I guess these faces are too expensive to cover up!Familiarity abounds as some bits recall MAD MAX, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, STAR WARS, and THE MATRIX. Director Villeneuve shot the film in Norway and Jordan, and to answer the question from fans of the original ... no, Sting does not make a cameo appearance. The film looks stunning and will likely satisfy the target audience. Whether it's enough to expand the audience is something we will know soon enough. The film ends with ""This is only the beginning"", and Mr. Villeneuve has Dune Part Two in the planning stages.The film will be released October 22, 2021 in theaters, on IMAX, and streaming on HBO Max.",Dune
208,15,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Fear is the mind-killer.""",10/10,26 November 2021,"Buying a bundle of Sci-Fi and Horror books on eBay shortly after the first Lockdown started in the UK, one of the books in the selection was Frank Herbert's Dune. Hearing over the years about it being a heavy-going novel, I was happily caught by surprised, when from the ""Fear is the mind-killer"" set-piece on page 19, I became completely gripped by this epic tale.Introduced after reading the novel by a friend to auteur film maker Denis Villeneuve's mesmerizing Arrival (2016-also reviewed) I started to look forward to his upcoming adaptation, leading to me booking a ticket for at The Printworks IMAX in Manchester (the second largest screen in Europe) to see the spice flow.View on the film:Building upon the cartel land desert of Sicario (2015-also reviewed) and the high granite walls of the alien spaceship in Arrival canvas, co-writer/ directing auteur Denis Villeneuve is joined by Foxcatcher (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Greig Fraser to walk across the sand dunes with Villeneuve disincentive long establishing shots, which unleash an immerse atmosphere as long panning shots glide on the seamless blend of CGI and the real scotching hot heat from the Jordan and UAE locations.Opening up the aspect ratio to 1.43:1 for 60 minutes of the runtime, Villeneuve & his regular editor Joe Walker intelligently use the contrasting ratio to bring the startling visions of Paul, (played with a fitting dreamy haziness by Timothee Chalamet) into harsh, startling wide-shot white light focus, which melts into Hans Zimmer's excellent burning score engulfing the Atreides family in up-close realistic depictions of violence (a major recurring motif of Villeneuve.)Greeting Paul, Duke Leto and Lady Jessica (played with superb gravitas by Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson) as they land on Arrakis, the screenplay by Villeneuve, Doctor Strange (2016-also reviewed) co-writer Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth lovingly captures the vast universe Frank Herbert created, from the shadowy figures of the Baron (played by a chilling Stellan Skarsgard) and the Bene Gesserit Shakespearean witches, to the anti-Heroes Journey Paul goes on towards the mirage of Chani.The writers brilliantly bind all who inhabit Frank Herbert's world with the graves and recordings about other families who have tried to tame Arrakis for the Spice, only to discover that Arrakis is the graveyard of empires.",Dune

But this remake is certainly something else. The progress we made now, technologically speaking, is just from another world. The visuals in Dune: Part One are just stunning with amazing spaceships and other tech. That alone is worth watching this movie. If you're a sci-fi fan you really can't go wrong with this one, it's all very mindblowing. The story itself is also entertaining. I can't wait to watch the second part to be honest. As for the acting, the whole cast did its best, they all gave convincing performances. At first I thought did we really need another remake of a 37 year old movie? Can't they come with something new? But I was wrong, this movie is totally worth watching, just for the visuals alone it's already worth it.

210,17,siderite,"More of a remake of Lynch's film, rather than an adaptation of the book",8/10,22 October 2021,"I am one of those few people who thought Lynch's 1984 Dune was great. It was terribly edited and had other flaws, but it captured what I feel is the essence of the book. Of course it wasn't exactly like the book, it couldn't have been. Enter Denis's Dune, 2021, everything can be done on a computer, actors have had decades to refine the craft, films are not forced to be one hour and a half anymore, the budgets are astronomical. So how is it? I liked it, but I feel that it was something closer to what someone does after thinking for a long about how they would fix 1984 Dune rather than a reinterpretation of the book or even a very dry rerendering of it like the 2000 miniseries.There are two things I really didn't like. One of them is the flat refusal to do anything that might be considered R-rated. The film is butchered to blandness, even when it features vicious knife fights, large scale warfare and sadistic Harkonnen. Second is Jessica's character, who is portrayed as a weakling, rather than the incredibly resourceful Bene Gesserit who has been trained for years that she is. I love Rebecca Ferguson, but she is not right in this film and nor is her character.The visuals, while impressive, were kind of subdued, too. The mutated Navigators don't even make an appearance, the Harkonnen look big and fearsome, but clean and not really vile, the worms are shown with restraint, the colors are muted, the clothes and overall attire are simple, functional and uninteresting.Bottom line: I am sorry to say that I think Lynch's film would have probably been better if the same resources and artistic freedom would have been awarded to him. This Dune doesn't really show as much an improvement as 37 years of thinking about it should have warranted. And it is tame and lame, refusing to take the artistic risks that should have been taken to portray with today's technology and knowledge a world 8000 years into the future and described with so much care and attention in Herbert's books.Well, back to reading all the books again and dreaming for the next 40 years of an adaptation of God Emperor of Dune...",Dune
211,18,thesar-2,"Long, Over-Dune",4/10,4 November 2021,"I'm so obsessed with going completely cold into a movie, I read nothing, watch no trailers/vids, observe anything to do with a movie prior to seeing the movie. In the case of DUNE PART ONE, that plan backfired.Had I known this was only Part ONE of what appears to be a 5+ hour SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW film, I wouldn't have bothered. Yes, in the opening couple of minutes, it actually does say: DUNE PART ONE. But, I read that as JUSTICE LEAGUE's Part 1 of 6, as in chapters, not actual movies.That all said, this movie deserves 4/10 stars for its incredible cinematography, visuals, special effects and score. Those should absolutely be nominated for Academy Awards. But, the rest, including another convoluted DUNE script, was pretty much crap.The technology they showed in this movie felt more like 8 years into the future vs. The 8,000 they want us to believe. But, on the flipside, the certainly not Tatooine planet had too much of...everything. How on that planet do they have any supplies or creatures or ""humans"" when there doesn't appear to be a drop of water on the planet's entire surface? If it's underground, how did they drill with no natural materials to build anything on the planet?I was also obsessed with that planet and how anyone could live there. But, that's besides the point. I hate this plot and barely made it through, even turning it off at about 48 minutes, but I was interested just enough to come back to it in about 10 minutes.Again, had I known this was just PART ONE, I definitely wouldn't have returned.***Final Thoughts: Just saw both DUNE films for the first time within the last 2 months and I have to say, if you loved the book or just curious about the film-format, I'd probably recommend this one over the David Lynch one. You can't go wrong with this score and these visuals. I understand the other movie was from the mid-80s, but frankly, I've even seen way better FX long before DUNE (1984) came out.",Dune
212,19,cherold,painfully tedious adaptation of an overrated novel,3/10,31 October 2021,"I wasn't a big fan of Dune when I read it. It was like a sci-fi/fantasy take on an old sword-and-sandal political intrigue thing, complete with dull characters and dumb story.On the other hand, it had this wonderfully anthropological creation of a desert world and its people. That was the only reason I got through it.Dune Part One is the first part without the second part. The characters are still dull, the plot still dumb, and the sci-fi world-building almost non-existent. The scenery and special effects are quite good, but nothing is interesting; even action scenes are listless.Will Dune Part Two offer the world-building that was the only good part of the book? Doubt it. Anyway, I certainly can't take any more of this.

213,20,FeastMode,visual and auditory explosion of beauty,7/10,22 October 2021,"I want to start by saying the most important thing. If you want to see this movie, WATCH IT IN IMAX. Or at the very least any premium screen (ultrascreen, emax, etc). Definitely don't watch it on HBO max unless you have a full theater system with surround sound. Whoever made the decision to simultaneously release this on VOD is a moron. It benefits from a theater viewing more than any movie since Tenet, maybe longer.The other most important thing to know is, this is half of a movie. It's basically incomplete. The first part of a 5 hour epic. I wish i knew that going in. I started becoming anxious because the story didn't seem to be progressing as fast as i would expect. I finally realized that the ""part one"" in the opening title was for the entire movie. It feels more like a setup movie than it's own story.The things i liked... there is so much. From a technical perspective, this is an absolute masterpiece. The directing, cinematography and music are all maximum top-notch quality. This isn't surprising, we've seen this from director denis villeneuve (omg arrival). And of course hans is the GOAT movie composer. They are why this movie is epic, to the fullest extent of the word. They are why half the scenes feel like the biggest moment of a normal movie.More on the music, i've been asking for something like this for a while. Where the music is the driving force of the scene, but not just for one or two scenes, but the whole movie. Forget about dialogue during these parts, just marvel at the visual and auditory explosion of beauty.So my dilemma is, how do i score this. I really hope they make a second one (now greenlit!!!), and if it's awesome, i can see myself always rewatching them back to back as a single long movie. But if they don't make one, or if it sucks, i can't see myself coming back to this more than once.I will give it 7 stars (awesome) for now. Depending on the outcomes mentioned above, i could see myself dropping it to a 6 (good) or upping it to an 8 (amazing). (2 viewings, opening night 10/21/2021, 11/3/2021)",Dune
214,21,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,The most anticipated movie of 2021,9/10,12 November 2021,"I have never read the book. I didn't know much about the subject. I watched the movie at the cinema today. Unfortunately, I watched it in 3D, 3D movies are still coming to Azerbaijan, I get angry about this situation. First of all, the movie is a very, very good movie. Denis Villeneuve is already one of my favorite directors, he did a great job. The acting, Hans Zimmer's music, scenario, visuals, camera work, sound design, effects in the movie are very good. I enjoyed the movie very much and watched it carefully. My score for the movie is 8. Actually, it would have been 9, but because I didn't know the subject, I had a bit of a hard time understanding it while watching. It was difficult to follow, but because I did not know the subject well.But overall it was a great experience, I'm looking forward to the second movie.

215,22,inkblot11,"Certain to be a classic, just like the novel, SUPERB!",10/10,3 November 2021,"Based on the elaborate, spellbinding novel by Frank Herbert, Dune tells the tale of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) far into the future. Born into a royal family who has ruled the planet Caladan for 26 generations, Paul expects to follow the same path as his noble father, Leto (Oscar Isaac). Paul's Mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a well known member of the Bene Gesserit, powerful and magical sisters. However, the Universe is ruled by a capricious Emperor who has become jealous of the Atreides. Therefore he allows the Atreides arch enemy the Harkonnens to plot to bring them down. This is disguised as an offer to rule a different planet Arrakis aka Dune. The most valuable element in the galaxies, Melange is only found on Dune. The Natives of Arrakis called the Fremen have been suffering for years under Harkonnen rule. To be sure, the Duke and his trusted staff and fighters guess there will be a trap somewhere. What they don't anticipate is betrayal by one of their own. Pretty soon, Paul and all those he loves are in mortal danger. Yet, Dune has legends about a ""chosen one"" to lead the Fremen to defeat all their enemies. Is Paul this person? It's very hard to give a decent summary of the story's many layered tale. But Villeneuve the director does a grand job in staying faithful to the book while covering all the major plot elements. The cast is terrific, with Isaac, Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård and so many others. But, Chalamet is especially fine and should get an Oscar nod. Then, the scope and magnitude of the visual effects and fabulous settings are worthy of the highest honors also. Dune is the type of towering spectacle that is rare to behold. Don't wait.",Dune
216,23,851222,Amazing cinematic experience,9/10,17 September 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!",Dune
217,24,tabuno,The Movie Falls Short of Lynch's Movie,7/10,22 October 2021,"Director Denis Villeneuve's attempt to improve on Director David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune fails in a number of respects. First. The pacing of this movie is slow and plodding. Second. The absence of the any Emperor scenes that Lynch so lavishly displayed on the scene offered up a spectacular science fiction motif missing in Villeneuve's version. Third. The absence of the powerful use of spice, a crucial element of the movie in space travel. Fourth. The casting and directing is rather mundane without the sharp and powerful characterization that Lynch cast. The Baron's character is a dull, a toned down shadow of Lynch's version while Duke Leto is a weakened version of Lynch's more dignified and royal persona. Lady Jessica seems too young and dismissive and also less than royal while his son Paul also does not seem to have the royal statue either. Fifth. The color, backdrop were wrong. Most of the scenes were shot in unnecessarily darkened shadows, Caladan, the water planet, had too much earth in comparison to the striking Arrakis, the desert planet, and anybody who has experienced the desert would realize how bright and powerfully sunny such scenes should be. It was hard to see what was going on in detail with many scenes. Lynch was able to incorporate this light and darkness, water and sand to a brilliant contrast. Sixth. Little important details went missing, especially the poor use of voice over that Lynch captured the thoughts of Frank Herbert's novel that helped to enhance many of the scenes such as the observation that people were more important than spice or how Paul was able to fit a skinsuit so well. Seventh. Unnecessary fillers that included a scene of Jessica and Paul in a after a crash that was not included in Lynch's version while Lynch included an extended fight training scenes and the use of the voice that enhanced the development of the plot even even though the special effect was crude using the box. Dream sequences were not photographed well as dreams like Lynch nor the blue eyes as effectively presented. Villenueve also used too many dream shots unlike the more selective and carefully edited nuanced use of dream scenes. Eighth. Villenueve offered up too many reveals too soon instead of the more tantalizing surprise discoveries of the audience to experience. It is really hard to describe in detail all the problems with this movie with one screening, but it seems that what Villenueve created was a mainstream popularized version of a science fiction classic with plenty of special effects but without the compelling edginess nor the strong characters that Dune requires.",Dune
218,25,UniqueParticle,Epic cinematic masterpiece,10/10,25 October 2021,"This is one of the best IMAX experiences I've had with an exhilarating soundtrack that flowed so well! I'm glad I got to see this with a good friend named Joe he's great to be around. Anyway Denis Villenvue directed such a wild ride that enthralls you from start to finish and I would say there's no complaints Dune has everything you'd want in it! I think if anything I'd say I don't understand why so many people get up during the movie there was a big audience a portion of which got up often I'd much prefer being prepared to see everything. I loved Dune worth every penny.

219,26,paulclaassen,"Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.",6/10,26 October 2021,"Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.",Dune

""Dune"" is more like a drama, science fiction movie than action due to the very few action scenes. I enjoyed it because I knew the story, the music was simply amazing and the direction which was made by Denis Villeneuve was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Timothée Chalamet who played as Paul Atreides was breathtaking and he made the difference. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Oscar Isaac's who played as Duke Leto Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson's who played as Lady Jessica Atreides, Jason Momoa's who played as Duncan Idaho and Stellan Skarsgård's who played as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Lastly, I have to say that ""Dune: Part One"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Dune
221,28,cruise01,Spectacular and visual feast in a epic scope.,8/10,22 October 2021,"4 out of 5 starsDune is a beautifully done epic science fiction film that is the start of a new sci fi franchise. Or an attempt to revive one. Even with the opening title saying Dune Part one. I never read the novels. Only knowing the film is the first half of the first Dune novel. Leaving the film with half a story and no climax. Which is frustrating and exciting to see more films. One can hope this film is a success for more. Which it does deserve more films.The plot is good and does open up for an epic story. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) is from the House of Atreides. Which he accompanies his parents to Arrakis which is a homeworld that has spice produced in the desert. Spice can be used for intergalactic travel. House of Atreides is looking for a reasonable peaceful trade. While House of Harkonnen lead by Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) is sending his army to Arrakis for an all out war.The cast ensemble is huge and every one did great playing there characters. Timothee Chalamet taking the main role was phenomenal. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. Along with Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa was good. Zendaya is fantastic even if her role was short. But saved for a sequel.Script did a great job with the world building and details on setting up the story. Great with the character building. Even for being a complex book. Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job in making this film a cinematic masterpiece. You can expect great cinematography set up in capturing beautiful landscapes. Visual effects. And having Hans Zimmers music score blasted at a high volume. Every sequence is designed for a cinematic scope to be seen on the big screen at the theatre with a great sound quality. Also, a down side on what you can expect from Denis Villeneuve is the slow pacing.The film does have some action sequences with great visual effects. The giant sandworm sequence is cool. Do not expect any big battle sequences. There is a brief battle scene in a dream sequence that is hinting towards the next film.Positives: the film is a good start for a franchise. The scope with action, visual effects, cast ensemble, production sets, music score, and direction all aims high for a cinematic experience that is epic and loud. It is one spectacular experience. The action sequences were good. Also ending abruptly for more films, do not expect a big climatic battle.Negatives: director Denis Villeneuve is fantastic in making a cinematic visual feast. He does take his time with his storytelling even with a slow pacing. Which he suffers in all his films.Overall, Dune is a good science fiction film which is spectacular and epic. I am excited and hoping to see more films. It delivered with a great world building for the story, visual effects, and action. It deserves to be seen on the big screen theatres.",Dune
222,29,zkonedog,Director Villeneuve Ascends To Film Stratosphere,9/10,28 October 2021,"Despite being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy fare, I had never read Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" novel. To be honest, the plot summaries of trade wars and odd names didn't exactly appeal to me. So, I came into this film armed only with the expectations that director Dennis Villeneuve (one of my favorite film helmsmen) would probably do a good job with the material. That sentiment turned out to be an enormous understatement.For a very basic overview, ""Dune"" tells the story--set thousands of years into the future--of the planet Arrakis, notable in the galaxy for its rich deposits of a spice that powers interstellar travel. Once ruled by House Harkonnen, Arrakis is being transferred to a new bloodline, that of House Atreides--with much political intrigue afoot. Central to all this is Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), a young man who not only is being recruited into a behind-the-scenes string-pulling society inhabited by his mother (Rebecca Ferguson), but also begins having visions of fulfilling a savior prophecy amongst the Fremen (Arrakis' desert inhabitants). Truth be told, trying to sum up ""Dune"" in a few sentences is nearly impossible and comes off sounding boring or trite. Rest assured, however, that the film is anything but.Perhaps the biggest draw here is the work of director Villeneuve, who may now be nipping at the heels of Christopher Nolan in terms of directors with the prominence to create a project with this type of scale. His ability to take a plot that, yes, essentially stems from a trade war and make it utterly compelling cinema is remarkable. It's Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings with the best themes of each franchise being showcased.Having a stellar cast certainly doesn't hurt, either. Besides Chalamet & Ferguson (both excellent), veterans of the craft like Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellen Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, & Zendaya play key roles. In a film that requires characters to look and feel epic in nature, that is easily accomplished with such a distinguished group.The visuals and music soundtrack also heavily contribute to the sense of scale in ""Dune"". While not flashy in any way, this is a film that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the planetary geography, interesting technology, and swelling score from Hans Zimmer can all best penetrate the senses.Yes, this film is technically ""half a movie"" in that a sequel will be released at a later date to cover the rest of the source novel. But never for a moment did I feel in any way cheated or frustrated by this fact. In this case, I actually appreciated the way the filmmakers set the groundwork without rushing to try and cram everything into a single runtime.Overall, my theater experience while watching ""Dune"" was one of the best I've had in some time. Truth be told, the only reason I deduct even one star is because I have to wait to pass final judgement until the sequel is finished. But I'll have absolutely no trouble going back to re-watch this effort again in anticipation of that conclusion. In a film era of endless sequels and IP-related projects, ""Dune"" felt original and fresh in a way that is (sadly) growing more and more rare.",Dune
223,30,Top_Dawg_Critic,"Epic visuals, stellar casting and great acting, but...",8/10,22 October 2021,"...the story was convoluted and plotless in the 155 min runtime of boredom.I'm sure anyone that's read the novel may have a better understanding of wtf was happening, but to me, this was a long dragged out middle episode of a series I wasn't following.All the visions - of which most were tacky, really resolved to nothingness. I know this is only supposed to be the first part of two, but leaving the viewer with not much to root for or care about, does not make an inviting viewing to any part 2.I also found Timothée Chalamet annoying as his character. Not sure why, but he didn't convince me.Although the score was typical ""Hans Zimmer"" amazing, I had difficulty understanding most of the dialogue when it was mixed in with the score.I hope many of the complexities of the story become more explanatory in part 2, but I'm not going to hold my breath.Sadly, even with all its high budget esthetics, the lack of any cohesive story gets a 8/10 from me, and I know it could've been more.",Dune
224,31,digitalbeachbum,"Visually stimulating, but tedious and verbose, with audio difficulties",6/10,23 October 2021,"I have never read the books that Frank Herbert wrote. I have friends who were big on these books and told me about them and how the original movie adaptation was lacking much content. Apparently the books are laboriously detailed and complex.Immediately I noticed there is a lot more filler in this production. Is it needed? I guess it depends on the viewer. The first production by David Lynch was abridged and rejected by many, but I enjoyed it for the efforts and the constraints put on him by the executives. He had a limited budget and had to keep the run time down. This was pre-LotR trilogies and 3 hour movies were not acceptable.The second production I have watched is the SciFi mini series which was good but forgettable. It was too complex and detailed. That casting was more than acceptable and the effort in to special effects was visually entertaining.This production is amazingly wonderful visually. I wish I would have read the books so I have something to compare the scenes to, because it might give me a better perspective to what I'm watching.Several of the scenes in the first 35 minutes are very similar to the 1984 version of Dune. The hand in the box/fear is the mind killer scene I think was very well done. The fight scene with Gurney is good, I liked the special effects but the scene felt cut short.When I saw the trailer I was put off by the casting choices, specifically Paul. However, here I am in 36 minutes and I've been pleased with the most of the cast's performances. Again, I wish I had read the books so I would have a better understanding of the descriptions of the characters.Some of them are very similar to each production, but others are complete opposites! I do not care for Jason Momoa being cast. He seems out of place. I noticed the dramatic changes in male/female of some of the characters as well, the age and the height of them. I'm not sure of the book and the description given. I did like that they used an Asian for Dr. Yueh.I've never understood the plot where Dr. Yueh turns off the shields. This seems more like deus ex machina to me because the writer needed a betrayal. I don't care for how simple the process was for this character to commit the betrayal. It should have had more of a complexity to it. Then in the reverse, the whole ""buy freedom for my wife"" by putting a hollow tooth with poison in the Duke's mouth so he can blow the poison on to the Barron? That's about as complex and convoluted of a plot device as you can make, but they do one then the other back to back. It is a low point in the story.The one thing that immediately disappointed me is the audio. I normally listen to my movies on a 12/100 level while using headphones. Sometimes I have to raise the volume to 18 or 20, but this production I had to raise it to 58/100 just to hear some of the voices. The voices were not brought to the forefront. When a character whispers, you don't keep their voice at a whisper. You bright it forward in the audio track so it is raised above the music or the ambient sounds. I also do not like how the volume rises and drops when transitional music is played. The audio is definitely a problem, and this is a production issue. I blame the director and the audio technicians for this.There are several scenes which I feel aren't needed. When Paul is talking to the servant who is watering the palms. I didn't feel this was necessary. It is more filler than it is to story development.As I stated, there are many scenes which are not in either of the previous productions. I think many of them added to the story which I did not understand previously. Some of them are worthwhile, others are filler which the production could have left on the cutting room floor.Overall, I think it is a good script, produced in an attempt to be true to the book. There are highs and lows. Some scenes great, other scenes meh. I question some of the casting. I think they did as good as they could do given the two different productions before it, but failed to find a middle ground.",Dune
225,32,SAMTHEBESTEST,The most beautiful visual spectacle ever created by Denis Villeneuve. A splendid narrative is little hurt by slow pace but is still worth watching.,7/10,23 September 2021,"Dune (2021) :
Brief Review -The most beautiful visual spectacle ever created by Denis Villeneuve. A splendid narrative is little hurt by slow pace but is still worth watching. Dune is feature adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. It covers only half of it and takes 150 minutes for it which makes it often boring and it's little complicated too for mass lovers. But the same loss is recovered by the spectacular visuals which shows us an unimaginable future world. Set mostly in desert, the film has almost every single property looking new in sci-fi genre, and that fictional imagination of the visuals deserves credit for thinking out of the box. Not just that but the cinematic experience is excellent too. Look at the background music and how turns a simple scene look thrilling almost every single time. Dune has a big cast so it's unfair to name just few names here but yes everyone does their best with the characters they are portraying. If that's not enough then watch out for the costume designing of every character followed by brilliant VFX work and innovative action sequences. The action is less and not hard-core in that sense because as we know the film isn't a superhero flick. Yet, it fetches your attention with that ideation about the results of the action scenes. One has to think what would happen rather than thinking what's happening. That's some fun you know. However, i won't deny the fact that Dune is terribly slow in the first half with no proper conclusions about setting the plot. Thankfully, the second half comes as an improvement and even though we don't get to see a full stop at the end, it leaves us excited for the part two. Overall, another Worth Watching Villeneuve flick but please don't overhype it as if it is too great and Nothing like we haven't seen yet.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",Dune

Nit-picking aside, this is giant, bold, gorgeous, epic, compelling, exciting, capital-C Cinema at its finest.

Unfortunately Dune fails at being excellent in many categories...The bad: the leading actor has little to no charisma. Just my personal taste. But besides him, even the other (good) actors look out of place and even look a bit silly (Josh Brolin). That's really annoying, that the acting isnt up to par for what should have been an exciting dramatic scifi epic.More bad: the entire look and feel of this movie is rather mediocre and kinda cheap. The visual effects (from the very start) are NOT impressive at all. They look really cheap. Nothing like the terrific special effects in Bladerunner 2049.Even the music, the editing, the photography, all those technical details which can lift a movie up to the stratosphere, are all quite mediocre. What a disappointment.Even more bad: I hate it when there are voice overs that constantly start explaining to me what is happening in the story. Too many characters and periods in the story have to be contineously explained to me as a viewer by this irritating voice over. I dont mind if I dont understand everything I see, I dont need a voice over nanny...Not any good? With so much money, time and potential available to make this movie, I felt really disappointed, that this isnt even near anything like other classic scifi movies.Not terribly bad, simply mediocre. And when it comes to epic scifi movies I really hate mediocrity!",Dune
229,36,southdavid,Come to the Party.,9/10,27 October 2021,"My prior relationship with Dune was thus. I've never read any of the books, I've seen David Lynch's film a couple of times, but couldn't tell you much about it beyond Sting in a mankini. This is to try and demonstrate that I come to this film on its own merits and not with any built-in feelings for the franchise. Whilst I can understand anyone that argues that not much happens, personally I absolutely loved it.The planet of Arrakis is a desolate desert inhabited by a native people who have learned to live in its harsh environment. The planet though is covered in ""Spice"" a substance that is a vital component to interstellar space travel. The Emperor takes the planet from the cruel Harkonnen family and into the hands of the noble Atreides clan. This, however, is not an act of benevolence, but a calculated move to stretch the Atreides' resources thin, before the vengeful Harkonnens will take their revenge.Again, right up on Main Street, I absolutely loved this. I went to see an IMAX presentation, which was a great decision as the scale of the film is one of its star attractions. Giant space armadas, the size of the sandworm all benefit from the extra scale. The all-star cast is another pull, with all the main characters played by a recognisable face and some, such as Javier Bardem and even Zendaya who must have signed on knowing that they were likely to feature much more in a sequel, than in this film. The central relationship is probably between Paul, played by Timothee Chalamet, and his mother, played by Rebecca Ferguson. I thought that was believable, despite the age differences not really stacking up. This is perhaps only the second film of Chalamet's I've seen and I thought he carried the film well.I can't argue against anyone who found the film slow or lacking in action. Those opinions would be understandable, though I disagree, and liked that the film spent time building the relationships and telling us about characters before they are separated. To me, it made the losses feel greater. As I left the cinema, my immediate concern was that, as much as I enjoyed it, if the sequel and the rest of the story was never forthcoming, then the film becomes set up for a journey we'll never experience. Hopefully, based on the latest news that is not the case, but if you're reading this at some point in the future, and for whatever reason this is not followed up on, then knock a couple of marks of the score.",Dune
230,37,paul-allaer,Denis Villeneuve just proved once and for all that Dune is unfilmable,6/10,24 October 2021,"As ""Dune Part One"" (2021 release; 156 min.) opens, we are in the ""Year 10191, Caladan"", and we are introduced to Paul and his mother Lady Jessica. Paul's dad is Duke Leto, who is assigned by the Emperor to go to Arrakis, a desert planet that produces a certain spice which is indispensable for interstellar travel. At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: director David Lynch gave it his best shot to turn the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi novel ""Dune"" into a worthy film in 1984, and more or less struck out swinging. Now almost 40 years later comes another respected and bold Hollywood director's attempt to do the same. Let me state upfront that I am a big, big fan of Denis Villeneuve, in my humble opinion one of Hollywood's very best directors these days (""Sicario"", ""Blade Runner 2049"", just to name those). My hopes and expectations hence were quite high, and I am sorry to report that they weren't met. It certainly isn't for a lack of trying or a lack of resources or casting. The production budget is a reported $165 million. The movie sports a veritable all-star cast (Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem). There is a noteworthy original score by Hans Zimmer (who else?). The production itself is out of this world. So what sinks the film? It is the byzantine plot, period. Almost from the get-go I found myself utterly lost, and I never caught up (I read the book decades ago). While this worked in the book because there we get all of the nuances as it plays out page after page, in the movie there is simply no time to explain all of it. That was true with the 1984 Dune film, and now also with the 2021 Dune film. In my mind, this proves once and for all that Dune the novel is unfilmable, period. Two of Hollywood's best directors gave it a shot, and they both misfired. So in the end the Denis Villeneuve interpretation of Dune turns out to be a beautiful mess. But still a mess. Please note that in the movie, the title shows as ""Dune Part One"", and it is clear that a sequel has been intended all along.""Dune Part One"" opened in theaters this weekend, while also streaming on HBO Max. Even though I have HBO Max, Dune is the type of film that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. The Sunday matinee screening where we saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but by no means anywhere close to a sellout (I'm guessing 40% attendance in a large theater). The movie's opening gross in North America was a better than expected $41 million, all but assuring that the sequel will receive the green light soon. If you have read the book and/or seen the 1984 film adaptation, or you're simply curious what the hoopla is all about, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on HBO Max, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Dune
231,38,kevin_robbins,This is an all-time great science fiction movie,10/10,22 October 2021,"Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see. This is an all-time great science fiction movie that is an easy 10/10.",Dune
232,39,DarkVulcan29,Amazing sci-fi epic,9/10,29 October 2021,"I won't lie, I've never been a fan of Dune, even the 1984 film, although I found it amusing in spots. A friend of mine wanted to see this, so I thought i'd give this the benefit of the doubt.Now the film started out slow, to the point ya'll be dozing off and on, but once it started to pick up, it gets real interesting, and becomes more watchable. The scenery is very well designed, and all the actors really give it there all. Action scenes are okay, but the effects are oscar worthy. I liked the movie but it still didn't make a fan of Dune, I might check out part 2 when it comes out.

234,41,stevendbeard,For the Fans,7/10,22 October 2021,"I saw ""Dune"", starring Timothee Chalamet-Lady Bird, Love the Coopers; Rebecca Ferguson-Doctor Sleep, The Greatest Showman; Oscar Isaac-the Star Wars movies, Inside Llewyn Davis and Zendaya-the Spider_Man movies, The Greatest Showman.This movie has great special effects and a stellar cast but it is for the die hard fans-of which, I am not one of-and it is also part one of a two part movie. I vaguely remember the 1984 movie and the giant sand worms-yes, they are here too-but not much more. Oscar is the noble ruler of a planet that is trying to bring peace to all the other planets. Timothee is his son and heir and he has been having dreams of a planet with Zendaya on it. Rebecca is Oscar's....well, not really his wife but she is the mother of Timothee and lives with both of them. Oscar and family go to another planet to mine a rare spice and spread peace but some people don't want them to succeed. The rare spice is a valuable commodity-not as just a food additive-which if controlled by someone, would make them very powerful and the planet it is from is overrun with giant sand worms, as well. As I said, the effects are great and they have lots of cameos-I remember seeing Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem & Dave Bautista-who may or may not have bigger parts in the next installment.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours & 35 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental if you are a fan.",Dune
235,42,Jackbv123,Part 1,8/10,7 November 2021,"The only major complaint I have with this movie is what the opening title credit revealed. This is only Part 1. In general, I hate waiting around years to see a conclusion and usually avoid seeing the opener until the conclusion is available. Yet, after watching it, I wouldn't have wanted to try to squeeze the entire story into anything less than 4 hours which begs for having multiple parts. The ending to this movie marks an appropriate place to pause the story while providing a climatic scene.Timothée Chalamet plays Paul quite well. His dramatic timing is excellent. His physical features are not intimidating, but his bearing makes up for that to some extent. All of the acting is good.The script is amazingly faithful to the book as I remember it. Yet it didn't lack for suspense. Intimate familiarity with the book has rewards that compensate for the obvious foreknowledge. There are several symbolic images that might elude the newcomer. My mind automatically supplied ""Muad'Dib"" when Paul comes out of the sand tent and sees the desert mouse. Yet I don't think the newcomer will have too much trouble following the story since the movie provides explanations where they are necessary.",Dune
236,43,JoeB131,Dune- as Endless as a Desert.,4/10,23 October 2021,"There is probably no point in warning about spoilers for this film. You've probably read the book or seen either the 1984 Dino DeLaurentis version or the 2000 Sci-Fi mini-series.... If you've seen either one of those, you've seen this movie. This movie only covers half the story, the sequel we'll probably never get to see will cover the other half.So how does it stack up? Not well, in my opinion. It's a loud, dull action movie, with an ear-splitting soundtrack. It has all the scenes you might have seen if you watched either of those two versions, but didn't do them nearly as well.At two and a half hours, it drags on. The Lynch version of the film was 137 minutes, and got the whole story in. This film leaves key aspects out, and only tells half the story, and it just goes on and on and on.To start, let's talk about characters. DeLaurentis got a cast of largely unknowns back then, many of whom went on to distinguish themselves. Kyle MacLachlin, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Sean Young. Heck, even the little girl actress, Alicia Witt, went on to have a career as an adult. This movie uses a cast of people you've heard of, and their screen time is often based on ""I know who that is."" Other characters, more critical ones, were kind of shuffled to the side.I'll give two examples. A key point in the book is that the betrayal by Dr. Yeuh, (played here with no charisma by Cheng Chen) because as a Suk Physician, taking a human life is against his conditioning. No build up, no nothing, he just does it.On the other hand, because Duncan Idaho is played by Jason Momoa, he gets a lot more screen time than his presence in the book. (Duncan's clones become a much more important part of later books, but that's neither here nor there.) His final fight scene goes on interminably here, while they were quickly brushed over in the previous versions.Similarly, while Peter DeVries is a key player in the book, here they don't even mention him by name, and he's just ""Henchman who gets poisoned"". Other characters are omitted altogether, including Emperor Shaddam, Princess Irulan and Feyd Ruatha. Concepts such as the Mentats, Guild, Bene Geserit, are kind of glossed over to get to those sweet, sweet action sequences.The movie rises and falls on the actor who plays Paul Atreides... and again, he's actually closer to the age that the character is supposed to be at the beginning of the book, but he comes off as a little Emo.Again, trippy as it was, the 1984 version did this better. The Sci-Fi Channel did it better...
Now, this film really LOOKS good. The visuals are immersive. But without strong characters and story to back them up, what's the point? It's almost like watching a Transformers movie. The thing is, they HAD strong characters and a story... they just didn't use them.",Dune
237,44,drqshadow-reviews,"Herbert's Dense, Moody Sci-Fi Classic Springs to Life",9/10,2 November 2021,"Tough to miss the marketing buzz for this high-profile, big-budget lunge for the blockbuster mantle. And, what a surprise, this time it's actually worth all the promotion!In Dune, the latest effort to convert Frank Herbert's intimidating and production-challenged novel to the big screen, creative heavyweight Denis Villeneuve has finally realized its potential. This is the rare case of a smart, lofty SF adaptation that remains fiercely loyal to the source material while also growing in more accessible, stimulating directions to appease a broader audience. Dare I say it... I think I might actually prefer this to the book? It's certainly more coherent than David Lynch's screwball 1984 adaptation.Clearly, plenty of thought and care went into interpreting and adapting the first volume's dense, tangled themes for the cinema - Villeneuve has confessed to being a lifelong fan - and, as such, it requires a comparable amount of scrutiny and undivided attention for newer fans to parse. But where the novel elaborates upon its wealth of interests (a deep dive of far-flung politics, culture, economy and revolution) through long, dry monologues and descriptions, the film is more fluid and efficient. We don't have to be told when we can be shown, and that's a particular area of strength for a work with this much world-class production design to spread around. God, it's rife with visual wonders.Even the expository bits, necessarily wordy by nature, are effectively managed to keep the viewer's head in the game. Everything doesn't have to be about talking heads, we learn, as Dune 2021 makes abundant use of subtitles to convey unspoken cues or nonverbal communication. That allows us to go far into the conceptual weeds without feeling verbose or static, a real godsend to a story that's so inherently brainy and long-winded. The ending is a mild letdown, a full hundred-fifty minutes of escalating stakes that culminates in a few meaningful glances and a ""see you in a few years,"" but the ride to get to that point is so well-balanced and riveting that I'm willing to let it slide. How long until part two hits the screen?",Dune
238,45,pixrox1,You can watch this flick with an eagle eye 100 times but . . .,8/10,18 November 2021,". . . you'll never learn exactly to which specific dune the title refers. Perhaps DUNE is trying to reference Lorna Dune. Maybe it's connected somehow to the Dune's Berry comic strip. Possibly it has something to do with a popular cookie. At any rate, you can sit through the three or four hours of DUNE without necessarily hearing the word DUNE used in any context. Is there some sort of treasure buried beneath the title location? If so, what? Maybe DUNE conceals a spring promising Eternal Life, or the ability to read other people's minds. Perchance DUNE offers a restorative rest, allowing its finders to emerge renewed for their next adventures. Though there are geographical features on the Planet A. Resembling Earth's sand dunes, there are also rocky outcrops, tors, mesas, buttes and hills. Therefore, DUNE would make about as much sense if it were entitled ROCK.",Dune
239,46,alindsay-al,A Good Film that Is a positive start for a new franchise,7/10,29 October 2021,"It has felt like forever but Dune is finally out and I have now watched the film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man attempting to find his place and learn how to be a leader while staving off enemy forces.Main Character
Timothy Chalamet plays the lead character Paul and he is good in this film. He just portrays the role well and you can see him struggling with his identity and the pressure that is put onto him, as the film progresses he grows in confidence and capability and he really does a great job of that. He isn't a character you will get that invested in emotionally but he has an interesting character progression and is an effective lead.Supporting Characters
Rebecca Ferguson plays his mother and she is really good. For me she was the real emotion of the film and you see this woman really get broken down due to her allegiances and loyalty to two different ways of life. She is a really strong actress and manages to stand out despite the top quality talent on show in this film. My other two favourite performances were from Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin, they don't get tonnes of screen time but I really like the heroic awesome warriors and they both do a great job at it and add some life into the film. Oscar Issac plays Paul's father and he is good in the role, I don't think it's his best performance ever but he is solid and you believe in his relationship with Paul and the dynamic that they have. Stellan Skarsgard, Javier Bardem and Zendaya also all do good jobs but they have pretty small roles here.Story
The story is a real coming of age story for Paul and in that I think it is effective and does its job really well. It introduces us to this new world and as an introduction I think it was also good at making me interested in the world and how things were done and run. But this film does have some issues, as a novice of the source material, I felt like so much was being thrown at me that it was hard to take it all in and really get to grips with exactly what character motivations are. Also the story feels a bit all over the place, it wants to fit lots in and it gets lost within each other.Script
The script is very dramatic and dark and it mostly works, I wanted to see these characters succeed in what they were doing but I did feel like that was mostly due to the quality of the acting. The humour is barely here, I am not asking for a laugh fest but it feels awkward when all the people are always monotone and incredibly serious.Style
This film looks gorgeous, the real star of the film is the cinematography and sound design as I was in awe watching it and listening to this incredible soundtrack. I liked all the technology and fight scenes too with some really interesting ideas put on the screen. But I had a real issue with the pacing of this film, it has a slow pace and it turned this 2 and a half hour film feel like a 4 hour film. I think this film could have ended at a certain point and I would have enjoyed it so much more, but it ended up dragging and overstaying its welcome.Overall
Overall Dune is a good film but for me felt short of my expectations. It feels like it is setting up the now confirmed sequel so much that it doesn't focus on the film at hand, it is still a good film and if that sequel really delivers then maybe it will all be worth it.",Dune

241,48,henry8-3,Dune,8/10,22 October 2021,"The Emperor gives Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) control of spice (the most valuable thing in the galaxy) mining on the desert planet of Arrakis. He travels there with his son Paul (Timothy Chalamet) wife Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and his council and army to begin. It is clear though that this shift in control is not favoured by the warlike Harkonnen or the mysterious desert people, the Fremen. Paul keeps having strange visions and at the same time there seems to be a belief by the Fremen that Paul may in fact be the 'one'.Villeneuve has clearly been attracted to the almost biblical epic nature of this vast and complex tale with its myriad characters and settings but has bought it to the screen particularly well. If ever a film has to be seen on the big screen with a stonking sound system, this is it, as hardly a scene goes by without breathtaking visions and sounds of a totally compelling and frightening world - this is truly a grand vision. It is pretty slow and often quite low key, but never boring and completely absorbs you from scene 1 punctuated by vast panoramas, amazing effects and spectacular battle scenes. The cast are fine with Chalamet holding his own as the hero with Ferguson even better as his wise but frightened mother. Watch out also for Stellan Skargard as the vile Baron Harkonnen - fabulously revolting creation.It should be remembered as per the opening titles that this is Dune Part 1 and as such you get the beginning and a large chunk of the middle of the story, there is clearly more to come (fingers crossed) for this to complete the full tale so don't be surprised when it ends. A great epic - see it at the cinema, it will not be as good on tv.",Dune
242,49,Fluke_Skywalker,Lacks Spice,6/10,25 October 2021,"More so than even 'Lord of the Rings', Frank Herbert's 'Dune' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. All of the novel's many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn't possible in the format. Therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way David Lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. Or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the SyFy network's 2000 attempt. Here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. Unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. Half a story simply isn't satisfying.The film itself is handsomely shot and the f/x are strong, though I dare say the design work is rather bland. The score by Hans Zimmer is an oppressive yet forgettable kit-bash of the ""exotic"" white noise that litters so many fantasy and sci-fi films in the 21st century. The characters are under-cooked, but the actors themselves are by and large solid.As someone who has read the novel three times I have a difficult time deciding if the uninitiated will have even an inkling of what's going on. But even if they do, I can't imagine that what we get here will ultimately be satisfying in a substantive way.",Dune

244,51,Pairic,A Darker Dune,9/10,19 October 2021,"Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.",Dune

246,53,masonfisk,THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED...!,10/10,18 November 2021,"The much maligned & bruised epic seems to finally reached the big screen in a successful form (the film's opening credits reveals this entry to be Part 1 w/the follow-up to be released in 2023). Most know of David Lynch's 1984 version & the 2 part Sci-fi Channel miniseries from 20 years ago but there was also a version attempted by cult icon Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 70's (as detailed in the great doc, Jodorowsky's Dune) which fell apart at the financing stage which would've starred Mick Jagger, Orson Welles & surrealist Salvador Dali (along w/a score by Pink Floyd). Now our cinematic savior, Denis Villeneuve (Sicario/Blade Runner 2049) has boldly decided to mount a sturdy version w/an all star cast to make a film which may in time be the watershed example of how a modern epic is made. The only default for me is that so far there aren't any surprises in terms of plot since I've never read the books but have watched both the Lynch & mini-series versions many times so I knew who the characters were, who played them in previous entries & so on but that didn't detract me from appreciating it for what it was.

247,54,aidanratesmovies,Star Wars- eat your heart out,9/10,23 October 2021,"A breathtakingly beautiful and fully realized concept, Dune may still have a handful of sillier moments- but it still manages to be pure sci-fi gold. First off, director Denis Villeneuve is an absolute genius, making some of my favorite films of all time, and some of the best sci-fi films in this millenia. His take on Dune is not only inspiring to watch, but also mesmerizing. You won't watch Dune feeling it to be a sci-fi film, nor really at all. This film is an experience, as if we have been placed in the future itself and are watching it unfold and I am absolutely awestruck at how Villeneuve is able to accomplish this. The acting is all rather solid, everyone does their best, but it's the characters that seem to be more the focus this time around, and i'm glad we have stepped out of that hole of just casting famous people in sci-fi films for attention. Rebecca Ferguson was easily my favorite throughout, although Jason Momoa, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsgard. Oddly enough I didn't feel the film was particularly great in its performance of Timothee Chalamet- not that he was at all bad- nor was his character- but his performance seemed to lack the charisma of so many others on screen- as well as Spider-Man actress Zendaya who hardly appeared in the film at all. As for the other aspects of this film, it's absolute gorgeous to look at. The visuals are astounding, the special effects are brilliant, and I absolutely adore the worldbuilding of the film and how grounded it all seems to be. There was a few ridiculous things I feel obliged to nitpick at, a moment of dumb toxic masculinity and a robot mosquito- but besides that- Dune was an unforgettable sci-fi masterpiece that I truly did enjoy and can't wait to see more of.My Rating: 9.5/10.",Dune
248,55,questl-18592,Duned from the Start,5/10,29 October 2021,"I feel I should start by saying I have minimal context for this film. I've never read the book(s?) and I don't really remember the '84 movie all that well. So I'm going into this fairly fresh and with no real explanations. That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story. Still think it's worth checking out, just for the technical mastery and stunning presentation but... That's about all that's here.",Dune
249,56,valleyjohn,Zzzzzzz,6/10,25 November 2021,"I have never read the book or seen the original film but I had the feeling that this film wasn't going to be my kind of thing and unsurprisingly I was right.This is the adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy .I didn't dislike Dune . I just found it incredibly dull.Sure it looks great and Hans Zimmer soundtrack is good but I found everything else hard work and to think that this two and a half hour film is just the first part !To say this is a slow burner is an understatement.My biggest worry going into this is that I wouldn't understand it . I was told by more than one person that the book is complicated and the 1984 film made no sense but I would say I understood 80% of what was going on which is Just enough .I'm not convinced Timothee Chalamet had a big enough screen presence to carry of the lead role and sadly the same goes for Rebecca Ferguson. Maybe it's because the graveness of the story made them look so miserable all the time ?It's been confirmed that Denis Villeneuve will be making the second part to Dune but I won't be rushing out to the cinemas to watch it .",Dune
250,57,masonsaul,Phenomenal epic,10/10,24 October 2021,"Dune is a phenomenal epic that's thrilling, extremely engaging and emotional whilst also feeling extremely unique and different despite multiple adaptations already existing. Despite a slightly abrupt ending, the conclusion was still satisfying overall.Timothée Chalamet gives an incredible lead performance supported by Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa, who are also incredible. Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster and Stellan Skarsgård are all great.Dennis Villeneuve's direction is superb, it's extremely well filmed with cinematography by Greig Fraser that is truly breathtaking and awe inspiring. It's extremely well paced, satisfyingly slow and immersive. The CG is consistently really impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer is perfect and so unique.

251,58,davidmvining,A solid beginning,7/10,25 October 2021,"Reminding me of the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring without the assured satisfaction that the next part is definitely coming, Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part One is a beautiful looking film that sets out to accomplish the impossible: telling the first half of a story. David Lynch managed an adaptation in the 80s that stuffed the whole plot of the book into a single two-hour and seventeen minute film, but Villeneuve has about two and a half hours to tell just the first half. The story has time to breathe now, and even though the film is largely setup without much of anything regarding payoff, it actually feels like a story being told rather than a series of events.I still hold the belief that one could adapt Dune into a single two-hour film. It would just require the cutting of a lot of stuff while finding the core of the story and nurturing that first and foremost. Villeneuve and his writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth went the much more traditional route of an adaptation of trying to include as much as possible. Well, that's not entirely true. They cut certain supporting characters like Feyd-Rautha and the Princess Irulan completely, characters who do have some limited presence in the first half of the book itself. That is not to say that there is no core to this telling, and I think the core is right.I've always maintained that the core of Frank Herbert's Dune was Paul's journey from boy to man to king to godhead, and that is the center of everything in Villeneuve's adaptation, mostly revolving around the relationship between Paul and his mother the Lady Jessica. Sent into what everyone in House Atreides knows is a trap, Jessica has to build off of what the Bene Gesserit sisterhood had established on the planet, the idea that the Fremen savior was coming. Jessica knows that for her survival as well as that of her son, they are going to need to play into these superstitions. This is established early, and the evolution of the idea is how the film ends, providing something like an arc for Paul, though it remains truncated.Around this is as much detail as can be stuffed into this movie, but Villeneuve's steady hand along with the healthy runtime never makes the film feel overstuffed. There's a lot going on, but it never feels like we're getting too much information. In terms of the extra detail brought in, I think my favorite is the focus on Leto's father and his death at the hands of a bull. Excised from every adaptation up to this point, it provides a sense of familial history about the dangers of taking unnecessary risks that helps color the family's move to Arrakis. There's also more attention paid to Duncan Idaho, the Atreides man sent to Arrakis first to make contact with the Fremen (which makes sense if the plan is to extend the films into a franchise where Jason Mamoa will pretty much become one of the most important stars in later installments).One of the things I love most about the film is its design and sense of scale. I think I would prefer Jodorowsky's more colorful variations on designs in the end, but the embrace of curves and impractical shapes for flying machines is a refreshing take on science fiction technology. The idea that a civilization tens of thousands of years in the future is no longer bound by how we move objects through space is nice, and the ovals, squares, and flapping wings of the ornithopters (finally realized in film properly) is all fun to look at. The different planets all have distinct looks that easily place the audience. Caladan is green and blue. Geidi Prime is black and gray. Arrakis is orange and white.In terms of the actual story, I'm not going to run through it. I will note some things, though. The relationships between the core three characters of Paul, Jessica, and Leto is strongly handled. Jessica obviously loves her son, and Rebecca Ferguson is a standout in the film for her performance, bringing both feminine strength and emotional openness to a well-written character. Oscar Isaac is strong, reserved, and fatherly as Leto, pushing his son to be as good a man as he can be, but also worrying for his safety in the face of danger. As the lead, Timothee Chalamet is fine. He's at a bit of a disadvantage because the central arc of the story is his, but it doesn't follow through. He starts the film as an eager, confused young man, and by the end he has to step into his own, moving beyond the objectives of his mother. He spends most of the movie quietly taking in the world and changes around him, but he does get some moments to shine. The supporting cast is mostly very good, my favorite probably being Javier Bardem as Stilgar. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is largely a non-entity as Liet, though. I imagine someone with gravitas holding the role again (like Max Von Sydow in Lynch's film), especially with Liet's expanded role in this film, and those scenes could just end up working better.In terms of some of the more fantastical aspects of the film, I think the film really captured some sense of otherworldliness that helps sell the universe. The Voice used by the Bene Gesserit is guttural and primal, and the way we see it through Paul's eyes gives it a dangerous factor as Paul loses even basic consciousness of what's happening. The visions, though, are something I really like. Visions and prophesies in stories are usually pretty mundane, straightforward, and entirely accurate predictions of what is to come. The visions here have some kind of tangential relationship to reality, most exemplified by Paul's vision of Jamis. In the vision, Jamis is a kindly and helpful Fremen, offering assistance to teach Paul the ways of the desert. Well, in reality, Jamis isn't helpful at all, but he does teach Paul the ways of the desert. It's a very interesting use of the concept.I was loving the movie at about the halfway point, but by the end my reaction was more muted. I think there are two main reasons for it. The first is Yueh. He's a linchpin on which the whole movie operates, and he's barely present, relegated to a plot point and not much else. In a large film like this, downgrading Yueh may be necessary, but it makes the key actions feel kind of out of nowhere which is not great for such a large change in direction for the movie's story. The other is the film's structure. As just the first half, we're left with the movie pretty much just stopping after the movie quiets down for a bit and we get one small spate of violence to end the film. It resolves nothing. Everything that's been planted in the first two hours go unexplored. The Fellowship of the Ring had a similar issue, but it felt like the end of a beginning. Dune just feels like it stops in the middle of a scene, more like the end of The Desolation of Smaug.Overall, I had a good time with the film. It's got great design, a wonderful sense of scale, good performances, and interesting looks at the world all while circling the central idea of Paul's journey. It's hampered by some stuff here and there, but not enough to completely demean the film.EDIT: Just an added thought that I had leaving the theater but forgot to originally include: Hans Zimmer's score is borderline embarrassing. It's 90% just noise. Zimmer can be very good. He obviously knows music, but whenever he's given carte blanche he goes extremely experimental and produces stuff that could be generously called interesting noise. This is that.",Dune
252,59,rgkarim,"A Desert Of Drama, Style, and Story: Game Of Thrones Meets Star Trek In This Modern Telling",8/10,23 October 2021,"LIKES:
The Pacing is Not Bad (most of the time)
A big surprise to me, this political thriller surprisingly moves at a decent pace despite everything it is introducing in the dense piece of literature it's based on. The establishment of the factions, the shots of the world, and getting to the planet are done in a very balanced manner, that allows enough time for you to get to know the characters, without being stuck on something for too long. Villeneuve and his writers managed to adapt the dense material of Science Fiction into a version for a lot of audiences and keep that balanced speed pretty much up to the last fifteen to twenty-five minutes of the film. A challenge that many fail in this day and age.The World Building:
I have not read the books, yet, but I've understood from others how much world building and development this series thrives on for being entertaining to the masses. Villeneuve and his cohorts achieve this mark for me, bringing out an amazing world developing experience in the visuals, the storytelling, and costumes that fill your screen for the nearly three hour run time. It's not just fleeting shots of ships, planets, and frontiers as some choose to do for time and budget. No, this particular installment takes the strengths of the modern era, and gives you plenty of time with the galaxy built by the author years ago. You'll get plenty of legend to the things dwelling on the planets, the evil nature of the mankind in the empires, to the legends and theology everyone follows. Where many books lose the translation of this for favor of keeping to a time, Dune makes sure to explore the facets and try to bait you into falling more into the lore of the movie. It's one of the strongest features of the film, and in true political thriller fashion, has those devilish details that pulled fans into nearly 8 seasons of debauchery.The Visuals/Cinematography
Dune is a movie that does not have the cheeriest of demeanors and it does not try to portray that in any light. Fortunately, a strong visual element will assist with this theme, utilizing fantastic visual style to convey so much the film is trying to tell you that may have been lost in the previous saga. The grey and ashen filters add an immersive element to the mix, helping you to feel the grit and grime of the desert planet Arrakis, and how harsh the landscape is. Wide angle shots and use of good CGI, show proportions of ships and landmarks to the small humans who crawl around them like ants. And the dynamic use of the camera, finding every shot to really give you the moment of the scene and have you feel the emotional kick. Those who say that this movie is indeed a cinematic masterpiece, aren't wrong when it comes to the visuals, and like HBO, has found the way to wrap you into the world and get you integrated into the movie even further. Even seeing the scale of the sandworms and what they can damage is brought to life, that visuals in the past could not copy given they did not exist.The Story:
I have to give them props, because all these elements due make an immersive story that HBO and Walking Dead held long ago. Dune's story has many elements done in a well-balanced manner, helping to give story guys like me elements to latch onto to help mitigate the other elements I do not find as entertaining. You want drama involving factions trying to stab others in the back and formation of shaky alliances? Dune is engorged with these elements. Need some type of mystical mystery and legendary prophecy made famous in Anime and Hollywood? Dune's got that to a degree to help layer a character. Want the venture into the unknown and attempts to travel a harsh landscape of life in more ways than one? Again, you've got that in spades, alongside hints of other elements that make gigantic worlds that book series like this thrive in. It's layered, it's got character development, and it's all laced with intrigue and a pace to keep you immersed into finding the end of this very bizarre rabbit hole.DISLIKES:
The Pacing At Times:
The movie does a great job with much of the pacing as I mentioned earlier, but there are times where like a video game racing, you get hit by the shell and spin out. For Dune, those moments for me involved Chalamet character's ""unique"" moments, something I can't go into too much detail to avoid spoilers. In these moments, the artistic side comes out, providing some dives into the events that are sometimes a bit off place and too frequent for a movie and better at home in a book. These moments sometimes are time beautifully, but other times are just extra details I did not need to see in such detail to bloat the already high run time. The only other area I had issues with, was the ending, where the cut off moment for the next part, starts to really wind down and drag in an effort to squeeze out that last bit of info to tease you. They are not the worst moments I've ever faced, but they were noticeable.Unexplained Storytelling Elements:
While much of the movie is explained and laid out, I agree with others that there is still some elements brought out and barely explained. Villeneuve is known to take liberties sometimes to tell a story, and those who appreciate subtle hints and letting a shot tell the bulk rather than an exhibition with concrete explanations, is bad at times. Primarily with some of Chalamet's qualities, alongside some of the technology and history, these elements ironically could have used some more time and attention to really draw a more complete circle. Not the worst, but certainly room for improvement, and would try to not be so subtle with key information for the character.Zendaya:
More so the lack of Zendaya. For someone billed in the top cast, I can't say that she deserved the merit of the top billed. When she's on screen, she's amazing as she continues to prove, but in this movie, the hype is much more than she actually is. I'm sure more will come if this Part 2 is made, however don't get your hopes up for incredible amounts of time on screen in this one. It's disappointing given how great she has done her roles for me, so here is hoping for the next part really utilizing her talents next go around.The Action:
Don't let the trailers fool you, or the genre tags on IMDB. Dune is not an action series and the hints of things you see are much like what you will get in this movie. A few passing moments and tech heavy scenes are cool, and there is one or two moments that build some momentum, however they fizzle out quickly, with most not lasting more than three minutes. The ending gets some things revved up, but the ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord Of The Rings"" statements in the trailers are hyperboles, unless you look at the new trilogy Star Wars then we hit closer to home. While I'm told Dune was never much about action, the modern marketing hints it is and I was not really that impressed outside of the cinematography and scale that Villeneuve does super well to execute. However, the ""climactic"" moments are minor for me, and only around hour mark 2 did I get any ""suspense"". It's very Game Of Thrones for this reviewer, more of the subtle and deceptive motions and key hits, than the dances of choreography that I particularly light in my epic blockbusters. If that's the kind of action you want, you are right at home, and it does fit with the themes, but don't think this is the John Wick, or LOTR battles that we fell in love with years ago.The VERDICT:
Is Dune the best movie of the year? Hmmm, not for me, but it's a fantastic modernization of the legendary picture that will appeal a lot of fans thanks to Game of Thrones. More like Star Trek and Game Of Thrones fusing together, this spectacle is beautiful across the board for visual storytelling. It's beautifully shot, the worlds are crafted, and the experience is there in so many levels, you will feel you are on Arrakis ready to tear into the Dunes. The characters have much to them, the cultures open up to an immense universe to get lost into, and the acting is magnificent on cylinders to really pull you into the political mess this tale is. And unlike the previous version, Villeneuve's tale does allow more exploration and immersion that fans like me love in films. However, in that regards, the Part 1 approach does cut the tale short, and the pacing and details can be thrown off by the restriction he still puts on this movie. Certain characters and their more intense details are limited at times, primarily Zendaya, and so you are warned that your favorite actors/actresses are not on screen for much of the time. Some of the visuals and sound elements fluctuate at times, but the theater will fix this, while the action will be much more limited than the hype the trailers are painting. Overall, the movie is definitely a great Drama/Space Opera, worthy of the theater to offset the limitations and to get Part 2 earlier will require you heading to the box office. However, the most epic movie still eludes this reviewer and I would say I've seen other movies I've found better than this piece. My scores for the film are:Action/Drama/Adventure: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Dune
253,60,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Dune,7/10,26 October 2021,"First Denis Villeneuve decided to piggy back on Blade Runner. Now he's doing an update of 1984's Dune. Hey bro, how about coming up with some original material. Ha-ha just kidding.Anyhow, 2021's Dune is pretty uncompromising. I mean why wouldn't it be. This 155-minute flick is very epic in scope. It's sometimes Kubrick-an and almost every wide-angle frame is like a portrait. Villeneuve's lens is as big as Texas and you expect the Sand People from Star Wars to eventually show up (I mean the movie is called Dune). You'll sometimes be wowed by what's on display but you'll also be a little head-scratched.In truth, I've never seen David Lynch's '84 version and I've never read the book on which the film is based (I don't read). So yeah, I'll just lay out Dune's plot and get it over with. Paul Atreides (a smothering screen presence in Timothee Chalamet) is the ducal heir of House Atreides. Paul must travel to an evil planet to ensure that the safety of his family and people is secure. Dune takes place in the way-out future (10,191 ad to be exact). It's a stoned, fever dream that feels like total science fiction manifest.Denis Villeneuve's vision is completely assured even if Dune's story-line has thighs and ankles instead of legs. Villeneuve's vision will also creep you out as he gives us sandy white tropes, dragonfly spaceships, wonted opening credits, a glacial pace, and Hans Zimmer's almost demonized film score. Heck, you know this is a Denis Villeneuve pic from the first darn shot. As with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Denis the menace is a creature of sculpted habit.All in all, Dune is not thinking man's sci-fi because well, it doesn't give you enough gumption to think. It starts somewhere in the middle and yup, its coda is somewhere in the middle too (I suppose that's why it's listed as Part 1). Whatever. Dune looks and feels like a million bucks (or $165 million if you're talking budget). There's a lot to admire here even if its disjointed narrative doesn't allow you to admire all of it.",Dune
254,61,rannynm,"A Modern Masterpiece - Brilliant Direction, Exceptional Visuals, Incredible Score, Great Cast",10/10,22 October 2021,"I love Dune. This film is almost like an introduction to a great story. When at the end Zendaya's character says, ""This is only the beginning,"" the foreshadowing tells me that there will hopefully be a sequel.Dune is an exceptional film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from the original sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. Fans of the 1984 version directed by David Lynch - and newcomers to Dune -- will be fascinated to see Villeneuve's incarnation. I absolutely love the cast, cinematography, CGI, makeup and many other aspects of this film.The film takes place on an unfamiliar desert planet, Arrakis - the world of Arrakis is breathtaking. I love the culture of the planet, such as the languages they speak, the homes the characters live in, and, of course, the makeup and costumes have a huge effect on the aesthetic of this planet. The story centers on a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who has an important role: His family is responsible for mining a very valuable and powerful spice, which is the most precious element on Arrakis. As the story unfolds, it's easy to be captivated and mesmerized into the illusion that you as the audience are with the characters on Arrakis. At times, though, I felt I was almost missing parts of the story. Since this is an adaptation from a book, a lot of information has to be left out, and I left the theater wanting to know more about Arrakis. I also felt that the beginning is a bit slow and most of the action in this film takes place near the end, although that isn't a huge issue for me.Now let's talk about the acting and this great ensemble cast with Timothée Chalamet in the lead role and his peers: Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Oscar Issac and many others. I've been a huge fan of Timothée Chalamet for a long time and this is one of his best performances to date. I love his character - you can really see how at the beginning of the movie he is a vulnerable yet strong boy who eventually stands his ground and knows his place. I also love Zendaya's performance; throughout the entire movie I was waiting to see her appearance. I also love Jason Momoa's character, another one of my favorites. Finally, Oscar Issac and Rebecca Ferguson work really well together and deliver very engaging performances.The costumes are very detailed and intricate which bring out fascinating elements of the planet. And the cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual storytelling is so beautifully done and goes in perfect sync with the production design. It's important to acknowledge Hans Zimmer who composed all the music since his score brings the sci-fi storytelling to life.The message of the film is we all have a purpose, we should find our own voice and destinies and true empathy is as powerful as blood lineage in our world.I give Dune 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX if you can. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!",Dune
255,62,pc95,Villeneuve Cementing a Fan,8/10,31 October 2021,"After scoring with Blade Runner 2049, I was looking forward the Denis Villeneuve's re-creation of Dune, and I wasn't disappointed. The beauty of the sound and imagery is stunning, and the story giving a feel of both past and future. The look is undeniable. This movie's production design is a triumph. Acting meanwhile is earnest and straight-and-narrow. This was the best sci-fi movie I've seen since ""Moon"" with much larger budget and cast. It buries the funky 80s attempt which has aged fairly badly. Pity now we have to wait 2 year's for it's finale. Hoping Villeneuve tackles more Sci-Fi in the near future.

256,63,mhorg2018,"Not the travesty Lynch's version was, but far from a classic or decent adaptation",5/10,20 October 2021,"Dennis Villaneuve should be kept away from science fiction. This is his third loser in a row. He took a classic, talked up how it was going to be so faithful and... fell on his face. While this is closer to the book than Lynch's travesty, he picked and chose what he would use and what he would change. Changing the gender of Liet-Kynes made no sense. Dune is filled with powerful woman characters-so this was just a crass PC/woke move. The guy playing Paul, the pivotal character in the first two novels, looks too soft for the role-although his acting was all right. Where is Feyd-Rautha? Not here at all. How about a two second explanation of what a Mentat is. Nope. Not here. No mention of humans not using computers, either. At least they mentioned the navigators, although they didn't show them. The pacing of this film is, in parts glacial and design, with spaceships that look like blimps-unimpressive. Rebecca Ferguson looks too young to be Lady Jessica. The rest of the cast is ok. Some parts look like they're mimicking the Lynch version. The director should have watched the then Sci-Fi channels adaptation which remains the best. Unless this really rocks the box office world-I doubt there will be a concluding film.",Dune

258,65,nancyldraper,Grand,8/10,22 October 2021,"If you have been patiently waiting for this film to be released because you are a fan of the epic book trilogy, I don't think you will be disappointed. Denis Villeneuve spent a great deal of his budget on sound, special effects, music and the pace of performances to make you feel you were watching something truly big and epic (perhaps I should tell you I saw it in an UltraAVX theatre). I should probably also tell you that CALL ME BY YOUR NAME makes it hard for me to like Timothée Chalamet in any movie just as EX MACHINA put me off Oscar Isaac (perhaps I have to get better at distancing an actor from a role. Surely, if their performance is that good that you have an enduring hate for their character/person, they must be accomplished in their craft? - Sorry, I digress). All that to say, this film cleared the field for both Chalamet and Isaac (they will be relieved, I'm sure), I totally bought in to their new characters. The acting is outstanding in this and the stand out performers are myriad and stellar. Indeed, that was crucial, as more of this movie depends on character than it does on furthering the action. I only have two issues with this film: often I found the sound effects, accents or volume of the dialogue obscured the words (I'm looking forward to seeing it again with closed caption) and, as previously hinted at, I found the pace of the actual story telling to be compromised by the grandeur. I give this film an 8 (grand) out of 10. {SciFi Classic}",Dune
259,66,denis888,"To Tell The Truth, I Am Not Impressed",4/10,31 October 2021,"Well, where to begin here? Long, very long movie of a very slow pace, with very dark and gloomy lights, very dour mood and very depressing feeling overall. It produces a rather sour taste and this sand sees to ooze everywhere. Timothée Chalamet is OK, but he is not yet the star to save the whole production. Other more mature stars, like Rebecca Ferguson or Oscar Isaac seem to be slightly better off here but the whole plot does not allow the to be beyond very tight frames which stifle them a lot. Zendaya or Josh Brolin are so limited in their screen time that it is almost null and void. Maybe, Jason Momoa is the real winner here with his bright and powerful prsence.Generally, the aftertaste is dour and sour and leaves no desire to wait for the second part, as the unbearably slow tempo of the first part and dark brooding atmosphere produce very limited wish to persevere.I'd say I am not impressed. Surely, this one is better then the awful 1984 version but still leaves much too much to be desired. To tell the truth, this is not my Captain speaking.",Dune
260,67,zhyarTheChosen,Alright,7/10,13 October 2021,Well i really loved the music and soundtrack of the movie but the storay took too long for a 2h+ movie and even not finished they could cut on a lot of sences from the movie and it would be even too understandable.,Dune
261,68,valadas,Overwhelming,8/10,30 October 2021,"Even if this movie wasn't worth of a good mark for the story plot, it would undoubtedly deserve it for the magnificent images, sceneries and special effects full of fantasy and imagination. When we reach the movie end we become of couse aware that the story did not end and is to continue in another forhcoming movie. The basic story takes place in a galaxy of a distant future and tells the fight between two families for the rule of a distant planet, one of them being led by Paul Atthreides ,a predestinated young man. One of the best movies of the current year.

262,69,gianmarcoronconi,Good but not too much,6/10,24 September 2021,"Mammoth film, with wonderful settings and music. A special mention must be given to the special effects which are breathtaking. The film, however, has two main problems, the first is its monstrous slowness which makes it really difficult to watch because some scenes could easily be cut without impacting the perception of the film, the second problem is the ending because the latter is missing as this film is only an introduction and for this reason when you leave the theater you feel like you have wasted only time in a film that was absolutely nothing.",Dune
263,70,martimusross,Totally Brilliant!,9/10,18 October 2021,"DuneJust got back from the unlimited screening at Cineworld of Dune, a truly gargantuan movie at 2 hours and 35 mins.After a disappointing Bond and a tepid continuation that was Venom, this movie totally nailed it. I thought it was totally brilliant and we are at the start of a new fabulous franchise, a story we have waited for over 30 years for someone to make a decent fist of!It was merciless if you had been living under a rock and had no clue what Dune was, difficult to believe but it happens. It was dark, moody, complex, with a multiplicity of characters and layers of meaning and intrigue. Of course we had the three set pieces for the fans, the gom-jabar, the assassination and Duncan Idaho, and these did not disappoint.This movie was so brilliantly paced, dwelling on the characters during internal conflict and then rushing forward with the action.The two things that make this movie a classic of our time, the micro gestures and styling that stamp this movie as something brand new, the second is the masterful editing, we moved from inside Paul's head to Jessica's and back again.The casting was inspirational in putting Rebecca Ferguson (not a fan) and Timothy Chalamet together, they totally clicked and Mr Villeneuve really got them to act their socks off! Of course much was missing, but there is no rush as this can be included in the next part and it seems sensible to have some measure, as it was it was an exhausting watch.Special mention must go to the scoring, it set the scene and was inspirational, this is an obvious Oscar in 2022.Whilst controversial Timothée Chalamet is perhaps the most charismatic actor alive today (Tom Hardy is my number 2) there is nothing this man cannot do and here he delivers in spades. I have read some remarks that Timothee's acting is merely proficient or perhaps nothing special and can't understand the ""fuss"", in response I would refer to the layered nuance of the Bene Geserit test, we went from irritation, to burning, to pain, a physical manifestation, alongside shock, defiance then resignation, an emotional manifestation, all at the same time in a three minute section of the movie. If you think this is pedestrian you try it in front of a mirror.I find one fault with this movie so it's a 9 outta 10 from me, to gender swap and racially rinse Liet Keynes, a much loved and established literary character, for no other reason than a political statement will always be unacceptable.",Dune

265,72,lambiepie-2,Visually Wonderful Part One,7/10,24 October 2021,"There is no doubt that this DUNE is visually wonderful. Grands sets, wonderful costumes, Oh my goodness - spectacular! Great music from Hans Zimmer! That's what kept me interested to start.And that there are actors in this that are beyond prolific in their roles -- the adult main actors, Oscar Issac, Rebecca Ferguson, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Stephen McKinley, Charolette Rampling(!), Stellen Sarguard and so many more, when they came on screen were interesting and forceful and convicted in their roles. They had my attention from time to time too.But the main male character young actor, Timothée Chalamet, just couldn't bring me into this more than what Kyle MacLachlan's portrayal did - as Kyle had that twinge of a 'mean-boy thing' going on that comes across in the roles he plays; and Timothée just doesn't have that coming across the screen with this. Timothée was lost and a bit milquetoast in the role. (To be honest, I wondered if the film was done 8 years ago if Kit Harrington would have been the better Paul... eh..) But this is NOT to dump on Timothée as I saw other material he acted in and did well. He just doesn't work for me in this Part One.It is about 'story'. And just like the 1984 one, this too is, is eh -- for me but again...a visionary triumph no one can deny! It's not enough tho' to wrap myself around ""the story"" and be interested in ""it's hero"". Maybe because this is is 2 and a half hours of Part One.Will I see Part Two? Will Timothée have more to chew on and prove me wrong about him in this role? Eh. Like I wrote, I love the visuals, the costumes, the music, the other actors. Dropping into a Part Two though... to see who becomes King of the Spices...eh.",Dune
266,73,thekarmicnomad,A bit of an info dump with flouncy fight scenes - but I enjoyed it. roll on part two.,7/10,25 October 2021,"The characters and actors are amazing in this. I really liked all of them and I got a good feel for everyone and got invested.But this is Dune and there is so much to unpack.Most films have about four or five moving parts - to have any chance of understanding Dune you need to know about the factions, the planets, the politics, the bloodlines, the spice, the supernatural, the worms, the space ships, the weapons, even the clothes are important.There is so much that needs to be explained and so many vision sequences it leaves little room for anything else. This film warms up at about the ninety minute mark, where a lot of other films are rolling credits.The fight scenes broke up all the explanation but, despite having some great effects, the fights were a bit dull. At times I felt like I was watching Westside Story as the armies ran at each other, their little swords drawn and danced around one another.I am not sure the logic of the shields worked either - a lot of those blows didn't seem very slow.I did enjoy this though.The story was interesting and engaging (even though I already know it) and I was left wanting more.At times it is a big, dry slice of pie you have to gobble down, but it is a tasty one.There is a lot of space opera here - but I mean that in the best possible way.Of course this is in two parts and although it means paying twice I think that was the right decision.",Dune
267,74,drjgardner,Awful,2/10,3 November 2021,"Two confessions: (1) I thought the 1984 version was wonderful. (2) I watched it on a 65"" TV. My assumption about TV was I would screen it on TV and if I loved it as much as the original, I would go to the movies and spend the $. About 10 minutes in I was really bored. Acting is terrible. Not just poor, but terrible. Everyone was terrible. The ""special effects"" are certainly unimpressive. Especially considering it's 2021 not 1984. Then there's the music, which is so poor you probably never thought about it. And worse than anything else, the direction and the photography are film school level. There is nothing in this film that appealed to me. I stopped watching after 30 minutes.

268,75,educallejero,An example of why Movie Theaters should never die,9/10,26 October 2021,"One of the best visuals spectacles I've ever seen (and people that saw much more cinema, I'm pretty sure would say the same). Amazing interior and exterior designs; perfect cinematography and use of every type of shot to showcase the incredible sets (virtual or not); and riveting action sequences with a level of tension hard to find in the typical blockbusters.The acting from the protagonists Chalamet and Ferguson is as pristine as every shot (the rest of the cast either has simple characters with not that much depth, or not enough to do in this first part).To say something not quite as perfect: the dreamlike tone of the film doesn't mesh as well with the more exposition heavy parts of the second act. But even after some moments that might feel a bit too slow, there is often some high tension moment, a good action sequence, or something particularly interesting that balance that out until the third act, which gets back on track to the very high level of the start.",Dune

271,78,Anurag-Shetty,Can't wait for Part Two.,10/10,26 October 2021,"Dune is based on the sci-fi novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. Paul Atreides(Timothee Chalamet), the son of a royal family, is given the responsibility to protect the most precious resource in the entire galaxy.Dune is a mind-blowing film. Director Denis Villeneuve can absolutely do no wrong, after back-to-back masterpieces like Enemy(2013), Prisoners(2013), Sicario(2015), Arrival(2016), Blade Runner 2049(2017) & now this movie. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The action set pieces are fantastic. What's really impressive is that they shot most of the movie practically, rather than opt for the oft-used CGI. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is otherworldly. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Paul Atreides. Rebecca Ferguson is outstanding as Lady Jessica Atreides. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Duke Leto Atreides. Jason Momoa is excellent as Duncan Idaho. Stellan Skarsgard is unforgettable as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Josh Brolin is awesome as Gurney Halleck. Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Chen Chang, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian & Zendaya are amazing as Stilgar, Dr. Liet Kynes, Dr. Wellington Yueh, Beast Rabban Harkonnen, Piter de Vries & Chani, respectively. The supporting cast is great. Dune is a must watch for all sci-fi fans & Denis Villeneuve fans. Go & witness the cinematic experience of a lifetime!",Dune
272,79,bankofmarquis,The Definitive Film Version for the Fans,8/10,24 October 2021,"Fans of the 1965 Frank Herbert Sci-Fi Fantasy Masterpiece DUNE can finally rejoice - the definitive film version of this novel (at least the first 1/2 of the novel) has made it's way onto the screen.Lush, dense, rich, well cast and acted with eye-popping visuals that should be seen on the big screen, Directer Denis Villaneuve's DUNE is everything that a fan of the book (that would include me) has been waiting for in a film version. It IS the ""Peter Jackson LORD OF THE RINGS"" version of this book - finally!The question is, how does this film work for casual fans of the book - or for the myriad moviegoers that have never read the novel it is based on.And, I'm afraid, the answer there is ""not as well"". For Dune is a dense novel, filled with mythology that does go somewhat deep in the movie. This makes the pacing of this film problematic - especially at the beginning, for the novice - but is ""deep enough"" for those that have read the books.Let's start with what works - and that is the visuals that Director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and his crew put on the screen. They are incredible. Unfortunately, most casual on-lookers to this film will decide to check out this 2 hour and 35 minute epic at home for free on HBO MAX, and that would be too bad. This film needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible to totally immerse you in this world.Villeneuve perfectly cast this film from top to bottom starting with Timothy Chalamet as the hero of this book (and series) Paul Atreides. He brings the right balance of cockiness and unease to Paul who grows into something more than the ""perfect prince"" as the story progresses.He is joined by some of the finest performers working today. Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin bring their star power to the roles of Paul's Mother (who is something more than Paul's mother) and the head of the military (who is something more than the head of the military). Both of these roles needed to be played by a strong force - and both fill this need admirably.The always good Oscar Isaac is the right choice for the role of Paul's father, Duke Leto Atreides, who - by story necessity - is underwritten and, therefore, this film/role does not showcase his talents.However, Jason Mamoa SHINES as Warrior Duncan Idaho. This is one of my favorite characters from the book and Mamoa brings his ""A"" game to this charismatic warrior/mentor to Paul. It was the largest pleasant surprise of the performances for me.Alas, the villains of this piece - Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his nephew, Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) are relegated to background ""mustache twirling"" villains, they were not able to showcase their talents in this film. But, at least, we did not get the ""golden speedo"" that Sting wore in the 1984 David Lynch film version.Also, not being able to showcase their talents is Javier Bardem and Zendaya as members of the Freman (the subjugated native people of the ""Dune"" planet). They are both in this film, briefly, as their characters rise and shine in the 2nd half of the book - so, hopefully, we'll get to see more of them, then.Which is the other part of this film that will turn off the casual viewer - it only covers (by necessity) the first half of the book, so only tells half a story with no real emotional payoff. For me, a fan of the books, I was fine with this as I am eagerly anticipating the 2nd film - but as a viewer who is just gonna ""check this one out"", I'm not so sure that the visuals of this film will be enough to satisfy them.Come for the visuals, stay for the performances and the dense story and prepare for Dune: Part 2.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Dune

It ain't easy. I know it's a cult classic sci-fi book, but I've not read it or seen the original screen adaptions.It's brilliantly paced and beautifully shot, and the actors are all given sufficient time to show their characters and develop.

And here they go, they actually delivered on the hype. This might be the 21st century answer to Star Wars.No need to cringe at that previous statement as I know Dune dates before Star Wars and that Star Wars borrows many ideas from Dune's Novel. It's clearly evident in some of the similarities. My point is that we need a good sci-fi drama to replace what The Mouse destroyed. Warner Bros might be the company that brings us a new sci-fi trilogy we need. At least I hope their is a sequel. I would be disappointed if this film is just a one film.BTW, I loved the dragonfly helicopters :) and the acting performances from Chalamet, Isaac, Momoa, Ferguson, Bautista, Chalamet, Rampling, and Skarsgård were absolutely stellar.People, watch it in DolbyVision HDR on a oled tv.

Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait.

278,85,bob-the-movie-man,"""He's Not The Messiah - He's a Very Naughty Boy!""",10/10,19 October 2021,"Certain works of fiction have been labelled with the tag of ""unfilmable"", and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel ""Dune"" is one of those. It's full of exposition done as internal monologues - which screams ""movie voiceover"". And regular readers will know my hatred of those!Amazingly, Denis Villeneuve manages to pull off the impossible with his version of Dune (part 1), which I saw last night as part of a Cineworld Unlimited preview event. It's close to being a movie masterpiece.Positives:
My 10*'s for this one goes for the overall vision, which is grandiose with scenes that stick in the brain. As he demonstrated in ""Arrival"", Villeneuve likes to go for huge spacecraft that hang ""in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't""*. And the ships in this vision are just HUGE.The ensemble cast does a great job, with Chalamet, Isaac and Ferguson being particularly impressive. Stellan Skarsgård (looking like he is about to tell ""a very amusing story about a goat"", if you get that movie reference!) looks to have the most gruelling acting job, having to emerge from, and descend into, a bath of black goo!Much like Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2049"", this movie has cinematography that is worthy of framing and sticking on your wall. (Greig Fraser is the man behind the camera here).Hans Zimmer's music is phenomenal. I'm not sure it's a good 'sit down and listen to' sort of soundtrack, but it fits the movie beautifully.Negatives:
It wasn't a problem for me, but I expect some will consider the movie to be too much mood and not enough action. I've seen some comment that the film was ""emotionally empty"": but I really didn't feel that, and am well-invested in the story ready for ""Part 2"".This is probably faithful to the books, but given all of the advanced spacecraft technology on show, and laser/blaster technology, it seems bonkers that when we get to hand-to-hand combat between the armies that we get into ""swords and sandals"" territory.Deja vu?: There's nothing new under the Tatooine suns. And so much of this film has you linking the concepts back to ""Star Wars"":""The Force"" is now ""The Way""The Jedi are the 'Ben and Jerry Set'. (Well, that's what it sounded like to me... and I don't even like Ice Cream! 🙂 )Both films centre on a Messiah-like ""chosen one"", foretold by legend""Spice"" also features in ""Star Wars"" with ""spice runners"" (as in the Millenium Falcon doing the 'Kessel Run')
There's even a 'pit of sarlaac' moment in ""Dune"".Of course, since Frank Herbert wrote ""Dune"" in 1965, there's a significant question as to who is plagiarising who here!Summary Thoughts on ""Dune"": At 2 hours 35 minutes, it's YET ANOTHER long movie: cementing October 2021 as the month of long movies. But this is a movie that MUST be seen on the big screen. It's a memorable movie experience and highly recommended. I can't wait for Villeneuve's ""Part 2"", currently in pre-production.(For the full graphical review and video version, please search for #onemannsmovies online. Thanks.)",Dune

Both of them could have been far better with some minutes less and more focus on the main story.DUNE makes exactly the same mistake; most of the movie is in David Lean mode (Lawrence of Arabia) with too long takes on the desert, on the rocks or deep dramatic and profound looks of the main characters. Adding to the agony; the very confusing dreams or visions; and about a 1000 takes of Zedaya digitally enhanced blue eyes; there is very little time left in the two and half hours to complete properly the story. Solution; trust people to see the older movies, the tv series or read the book and take out essential parts. The Baron other nephew (Feyd), the Emperor and his daughter or transport union creatures are nowhere to be seen.The conflict of interest is barely explained in a few lines of dialog; the Duke achievements with the Fremen are not given any importance.A friend of mine, not familiar with the above, ask me what was happening and who were some of the characters; so do not expect to understand most of it if you are not familiar.In the acting department; Chamalet is fine but he does not look as a rebel fighter; more as a scared young boy some mother issues. Fergusson however is very good she even survives her many many face close-ups.For those who complained about Lynch's 1984; in this one story is the basically same but with slower pace. Lynch made a more compelling first part in 60 minutes with far easy to understand and with more character development than the 150 minutes in the new version. The only noticeable difference; the insinuation of some complot from the Bene Gesserit with Jessica involvement.Last but not least; while the visuals are too spectacular; action scenes are not and with little or not emotion.In brief; better visuals but not much more than the old movie and the series.",Dune
280,87,Snootz,A MIXED ADVENTURE,5/10,19 October 2021,"I'm not going to take the position of a ""Dune Fanboy"" who believes a Dune movie can do no wrong. This version suffers from a poor choice of actors. Leto does not have the screen presence of a Duke, Paul does indeed look like a boy and I'm sorry... that's just not Lady Jessica. Duncan Idaho was better portrayed than any other character and really, seemed the only heart and soul in the entire film.Deviation from the original book is okay; I expect such in a movie. But this deviated needlessly, in ways that had me yawning. Presentation was poor. In a major battle scene the suits worn by the Fremen and Sardukar were so similar it was difficult to tell one from the other. The sandworms are not nearly as impressive as prior movies. Many vital dramatic points of the book (and prior movies) were left out, which cost a great deal of essential character.I was disappointed to find out it was Part 1 of (what 2, 3, 4?). There was nothing in the trailers that indicated this would be a multi-year series. Gah. This wasn't a ""slow burner""; it was a fizzle. In this day of superb CGI in even the most basic films I wasn't impressed by the ""special effects"". There was far too much time spent on trivial drama without nearly enough focus on key plot elements.What was most missing in this version is the heart that made Dune such a masterpiece. The plot moves more slowly than the Baron, and in the end it was simply disappointing. I expected far more from a movie made in this decade than those made 21 and 37 years ago. Another reviewer mentioned this was very much like the TV miniseries created in 2000. I have to agree.I don't demand constant action/adventure in films, especially in a cerebral classic such as Dune. But I did expect some directing skill in both screen adaptation and directing. We're disappointed to find neither in this rendition. It's a shame to wait so long for a film, only to find the anticipated blockbuster is yet another mediocre attempt at bringing the impressive world of Dune to the main screen... and not all that different from what has gone before. I think that's what surprises me most is that it isn't significantly better than it is. They should have titled this ""Dune Retro"".",Dune
281,88,Sir_AmirSyarif,An immersive cinematic experience,9/10,19 October 2021,"Modern master Denis Villeneuve delivers a masterful, spectacular adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic. 'Dune' takes its time to build and present its universe, but Villeneuve makes the most out of his canvas, using score, sound, and design to tell stories, and building the atmosphere with Greig Fraser's cinematography. The performances are uniformly excellent with Timothée Chalamet holds his own in his first blockbuster leading role. An immersive cinematic experience.

282,89,Neptune165,"So many slo-mos and flashbacks in the movie, This movie was so boring",4/10,19 October 2021,"I fell asleep the 1st and 2nd time. Got 1 hour in and gave up on it bored. This movie is such a drag. There is not a single captivating thing about the movie. Not the plot, not the story, not the action, not the Suspense. So slow didn't even care towards the second half. What a huge disappointment after so much hype around it. Waste of time. The over dramatic seriousness of the characters made it even worst. The movie was boring, dragging and had too many unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute to overall plot of the story, they should've just made it a TV Series instead. Nowhere near as gritty or screwed up as 1984 original cat milk. Fun fact there are 3 versions of Momoa in movie. Long beard, short beard and no-beard. The movie More like long close-up shots of people's face while they're thinking, everybody talking Shakespearean, overemotional & overlong scenes of people doing NOTHING. It's an incredibly slow burning movie with little action, and the action they have is quite frankly boring. I get this is only part one but it didn't offer nothing in my opinion.",Dune

284,0,SnoopyStyle,golden hour Bond,7/10,11 November 2021,"James Bond (Daniel Craig) is married to Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux). She has a secret past. He's visiting the grave of Vesper Lynd when Spectre attacks. Blofeld claims that Madeleine is a daughter of Spectre. It's five years later. Bond is retired and living alone. Russian bio-weapon scientist Valdo Obruchev has been kidnapped by new baddie Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). MI6 and the CIA are at cross-purposes. Both are searching for Obruchev.This reportedly is to be Craig's final outing as Bond. This feels very much like a lot of James Bond's greatest hits. There is golden hour shot near the end where I realize that this is really the golden hour of Craig's Bond. The sun is setting on his tenure. Madeleine talking to Mathilde is tinged with nostalgia. She's telling her about his past. His chapter of the book is done.As for the movie, it opens great. There is a great chase in the narrow streets of an Italian mountain village. I love the motorcycle jump. It's so simple and so clean. There are no jumpy cuts or shaky camera work in that shot. Ana de Armas has a great introduction with her ""three weeks of training"". I like M's duplicity. I'm less enamored with Blofeld's transformation into Hannibal Lecter. I would rather they imagine something else, something different. Safin is definitely the weakest link. Rami Malek is forced to do a dull old fashion villain. Bond is talking to M and they actually made fun of the new villain as having the same old evil plans. It would have been a lot simpler if Obruchev is the new villain. He played M and has his own kill list. His joke to Nomi about killing all the black people is more chilling and more memorable than anything yadayada evil plan from Safin. Safin's best scenes happen in the beginning without showing his face. It's a long movie and by hour three, the repetitive gun fire keeps droning on and on. It gets a bit tired. It would have helped by cutting out one villain and concentrating the screen time. This is the end Beautiful friend.",No Time to Die
285,1,Horst_In_Translation,"Craig's time as 007 ends on a fairly high note, but I still hoped it could be better",6/10,24 October 2021,"""No Time to Die"" is a co-production between the United States of America and the United Kingdom from 2021 and this is of course the most recent James Bond film we have here. It is a definite contender for most awaited film of the decade because on the one hand the viewer numbers are self-explanatory and on the other hand this film has been delayed so many times because of the corona pandemic that it was truly high time for it to actually hit theaters everywhere. Which it did not too long ago. Being a a huge Bond fan myself, who has seen all the other films (no exceptions), I was curious enough to watch several hours of red-carpet broadcast from London a while ago when the film had its world premiere there and most key cast members showed up and the Royals were also there to check it out. It runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes which makes it a truly long film and even if it is an hour or so longer than another Daniel Craig Bond movie, nobody can really be surprised. It was already an option that Craig could end his Bond career before this one here, but he returned again for a fifth and final 007 performance. Unfortunately, as you can see from the title of my review, I don't think this was as amazing as it could have been. I still think that Casino Royale and Skyfall are his two best movies and clearly ahead of the rest, even if it's not easy at all to pick the number one. But that is another story. Let's look at this one here now. Director is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who is mostly known for his work on True Detective, so the outcome here is surely his biggest big screen success as of now. He is also one of the writers and the other two are again Purvis and Wade who were already there during the Brosnan era. Enough said. They could very well also be there again when the next 007 takes over. Whoever it will be. I mean we already have a Black female 007 in this film, even if I doubt she will become the new lead to the franchise. But we will see.As for the cast, there is nothing to say about Craig anymore. Some of the others are people who reprise their characters from previous movies. Especially the one before. Léa Seydoux is back playing Bond's one and only love interest in this film and it's very serious as we find out, not only because of the child that joins them, but also because of the long sequence early on, which is linked to Vesper Lynd again and her story of betrayal back in Craig's very first Bond movie, so it is a bit of a framework you could say. Is he betrayed again? This time by Madeleine? Christoph Waltz is in this film here too. No surprise obviously, but he does not have a lot of screen time unfortunately. He is an actor I like and I definitely think that there could have been much more to his Blofeld than there was in this film and the previous one. Let's be honest: With what they did with/to him here, it maybe would have been better if he had not been in the film at all. I think Fukunaga was basically only looking for a way to get him out of the picture somehow and put all his focus on the key antagonist in here. That would be the character played by Oscar winner Rami Malek. He is a new addition to the cast and (if we don't count the very first masked scene) it takes quite a while for him to finally join the action, namely when he sits there in Madeleine's presence, but once he is there, he is bound to stay. Great screen presence as always and his villain character is among the better aspects from this film, especially in that scene where he takes the girl from her with the aura of poison all around him. Another antagonist character is played by Dali Benssalah. Very easy to identify too with his physicality. Not just the eye, even if this eye, especially in the final fight scene, and how he/it is taken out is maybe the biggest cult moment from this film and I had to think of Oddjob's hat back in Goldfinger there. I could go on and on. Jeffrey Wright is there again, so is Ralph Fiennes. Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris. New faces with a decent amount of screen time include Lashana Lynch, David Dencik and Billy Magnussen. All no really big names, so they made sure nobody takes away too much attention from Craig's farewell performance.Comedy is once again nothing you find too frequently in here. There was some banter here and there between Bond and the new 007 about who is allowed to carry this number. There was this eye scene linked to the gadget, the one I just mentioned. Oh and maybe for my comedic highlight of it all I must mention Ben Whishaw. His talk about the guest he was about to have was more of a politically correct failure piece of comedy, maybe also linked to the actor's own sexuality, but when he tried to pretend in front of M that he had not seen Bond before this encounter, it was pretty funny. I give them/him that. Big smile there. As for the more dramatic moments, of course the one that stands out the very most is the exact ending. Bond has never died before in these films, so they were taking completely new directions here. I am not sure if I like it though. Big challenge and they probably could not have depicted it any better, but Bond always had this unkillable aura and maybe they should have stayed with it. Like breaking an unwritten rule. Oh well, this was not the first time Blofeld died either and they killed Leiter in the process of it too, but they will all be back sooner or later. In any case, these rockets hitting the island were pretty spectacular. Also bittersweet that they came from his side and 007 ordered them to be fired and you could say that M or MI6 messed up themselves by the fact that they lost this Heracles, this priceless killing program, to the bad side. So his own folks' shortcomings result in Bond's death in this movie. But he still makes sure that evil is buried with him and this gigantic factory of villainy goes down as well. The island between Russia and Asia here I liked the way it was depicted. The isolation of it all, but also these water areas (or liquid areas) in which people were working in thick riot gears. Not sure this is the right word.As for the Bond song by Billie Eilish, I remember not liking it too much when I heard it first. Then it grew a bit on me over the months in the process of looking forward to this film perhaps. Now, as I heard it connected to the movie, I again am not too big on it. Also felt to me as if it was not used on many other occasions except the opening sequence where they always use the Bond song. So yeah, this will surely be one of the more forgettable Bond song and I am pretty sure that it will not repeat the awards success that Adele and Sam Smith had with their previous Bond songs. But we will see. An Oscar nomination seems like a big success already from my perspective. The win is not an option as of now the way I see it. I should probably also mention Finneas as he is co-writer, but I just don't really understand the Eilish hype at all. The music that stands out way more here is certainly Louis Armstrong's ""We Have All the Time in the World"", a timeless classic that you will hear with the closing credits and you also hear the name of this song being referenced on several occasions during this movie, key occasions really. The timelessness of this piece is something Eilish and her brother can only dream of. And it's also a beautiful jump back in time because this was used back in the day during the early 007 movie days already. For Dr. No if I am not mistaken. So yeah, the film had something to offer on the music front as well, not only with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. The technicality we don't need to criticize. Costumes, sets, makeup, cinematography, sound effects etc. All this is in competent hands here and could not have been much better. But story is key and this is the reason why I don't give a truly high rating. By the way, I thought on some occasion that Madeleine's father here could be Blofeld. I mean we hear about him being a killer, a doctor which he is in the old film, always carries the title Dr. Ernst Stavro Blofeld and here in the previous film he even went with Mr. Bleuchamp, so a French connection was also there. So when we know that Bond can kill Blofeld with his hands because of the virus, I thought that he would kill Madeleine too, but they touched and kissed and she did not die, so we did not find out about her real father.As for Malek's character, he is of course also a tragic figure with what happened to his family earlier and his revenge idea in terms of killing the killer's family can be related to somehow, but what he turns into is definitely insane. I mean this was a touch of Thanos already I felt. Killing millions of people and causing some kind of natural selection this way. While with Thanos we were getting this idea of a relentless god, I still felt that they could have elaborated a bit more there on Safin's approach. Not the tennis player. Sorry, I just had to. Overall, this is of course unsurprisingly another Bond film that people who like the franchise should not miss out on and it is also definitely a better watch in movie theaters. Go see it on the big screen and preferrably do so now while it is still on because I have made the experience that at least here they do not really show past Bond films in movie theaters. The old ones. Maybe because they are all on television still from time to time and actually several times each year. I am not sure what you will like most about this movie, but I think there is enough to pick from and there are definitely more positive moments to the outcome here than negative moments. Actually, almost no negative moments. Ana de Armas could have been given better material. I mean she is second-cast on imdb because of her name, but barely a factor. Oh well, maybe we will see more from her character in the next movie. It's still also never really a great film unfortunately. I feel like Fukunaga was playing it safe overall, which hurt the film.

She never did have time to tell him her secret.However there is a new foe called Safin and he is bearing a grudge but it is against Spectre.The movie is long and lacks a spectacular action sequence. It also feels a lot like a Christopher Nolan film. Just check out all those black Range Rovers, the booming bass and the car action scenes.I also thought Safin himself was a weak baddie. I could understand his hatred for Blofeld but not against the world or Bond.The stirrings of a Louis Armstrong song at the beginning gives the impression that the movie will contain several farewells.For Bond there are also a few new character developments. He crosses swords with M.

It felt like a good movie, but it felt quite divorced from the Bond I grew up with ... the Bond I knew. But apart from that effort being a Bond begins sort of thing (and this being the other end of that ... line), the franchise bit by bit gave us certain things ... we as viewers yearned for. While keeping it fresh.Bond ... James Bond! That line - one of many that are (in)famous in the long list of Bond movies - gets a new spin here. As is the iconic Bond shooting towards the camera. Now I could name many more things that this film revisits and I probably still would miss some. There are many references here, either visually or via audio.The beginning is quite the introduction ... it is almost funny because it takes its time. And it is funny because the rest sometimes feels rushed. There are many loose ends the movie wants to (neatly?) tie up. Another day, another Bond song, another Bond intro - although quite late in the game.Bond has grown - grown not just over the course of the movie Craig played him, but generally speaking. Society changes and Bond has no issue sitting on on the backseat of a motorbike, while a woman is driving. That is not enough for you to go on a rampage and scream ""wokeness"".Many known faces return, but many new ones too. Be it the ever excellent if only shortly used Ana de Armas (no pun intended) or our uber villain Rami Malek. Now while I really liked what I saw and while the running time is 2,5 hours ... there are things that can be seen and called flaws. You can question Bonds love to Eva Greens character ... or him still holding onto her, you can question methods used and how convenient certain things happen - or how some stunts would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame ... but if you did that, you would derive yourself of a lot of fun.Not being aware of the previous entries may not be necessary, but you'll have a lot of things to discover and smile at, if you have seen at least some of them. Of course if it is only a few of them, make it the Craig Bonds, so you have the whole ... story. Generally speaking I can't wait to revisit all the movies.No time to watch (them)? Well make time ;) Also to conclude with a fun ""fact"": the title No time to Die has been used before ... by another movie in 2006. The year Daniel Craig became Bond! Coincidence? Or full circle? All kidding aside, I have not seen that movie (yet), so don't hate on me if it isn't any good. Otherwise, out with the old ... in with the new - whoever that may be and however the franchise is going to reinvent itself ... I'll be there - I hope you will be there too.",No Time to Die
290,6,jboothmillard,No Time to Die,7/10,24 October 2021,"The twenty-fifth Bond movie, reported as the last for the leading actor, was first delayed by the departure of original director Danny Boyle, due to creative differences, and then three or four times by the impact of COVID-19, with the lockdowns and restrictions. It became probably the most highly anticipated film in the franchise's history and was predicted to be the biggest film to bring audiences back to the cinemas. Finally, after almost two years of delays and waiting, it was released; I am a huge fan of Bond and I was super excited to see it on the big screen, co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag), directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation). Basically, in the opening flashback, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) visits the house of Mr. White, intending to kill him. He is not there, but his wife (Mathilde Bourbin) and daughter, young Madeleine Swann (Coline Defaud), are inside. While Safin kills White's wife, Madeline shoots him and flees, but Safin survives. He chases Madeline onto a nearby frozen lake, and she falls through the ice, but Safin rescues her. In the present, Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) is with James Bond (Daniel Craig) in Matera, following the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Bond's resignation. While he is there, Bond visits the tomb of his former lover Vesper Lynd, but he is ambushed by assassins from the Spectre organisation. The assassins, led by mercenary Primo aka ""Cyclops"" (Dali Benssalah), who has a cybernetic eye, chase Bond and Madeleine in Bond's gadget ladened Aston Martin DB5. Although they manage to overpower and evade the assassins, Bond believes Madeleine has betrayed him, despite her pleas, and leaves her. Five years later, MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) is kidnapped from a secret MI6 laboratory. With the approval of M (Ralph Fiennes), Obruchev had developed Project Heracles, a bioweapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica, where he is contacted by his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and his colleague Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). Leiter asks for Bond's help in finding Obruchev, which he declines. But then he meets Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an MI6 agent who has been a Double-O for two years, becoming his successor as 007. She tells him about Project Heracles, after which Bond agrees to help Leiter, despite Nomi's warnings not to interfere. Bond goes to Cuba and meets CIA agent Paloma (Knives Out's Ana de Armas), as they infiltrate a Spectre meeting for Blofeld's birthday where they believe Obruchev will be. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh, Blofeld uses Primo's ""bionic eye"" to lead the meeting and order his members to kill Bond with a ""nanobot mist"". But the mist instead kills all the Spectre members, as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them, on orders from Safin. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvous with Leiter and Ash on a boat. But Ash reveals himself to be double agent working for Safin, he shoots Leiter and escapes with Obruchev. With a bomb exploded and the boat sinking, Bond is forced to leave the fatally wounded Felix, but he promises, before he dies, he will finish the mission. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld in prison to try to find Obruchev. Safin visits and coerces Madeleine to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld, as she has been his only visitor since his incarceration. Bond and Madeleine are speechless seeing each other at Blofeld's prison cell, he touches her and unknowingly infects himself before she leaves. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper's tomb to appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him. Bond reacts by attacking Blofeld, unintentionally causing the nanobots to infect and kill him. Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), but she claims she is not his. Madeleine tells him that when Safin was a boy, his parents were murdered by her father on Blofeld's orders. Safin was the sole survivor of Mr. White's dioxin attack on his family, leaving him facially disfigured from chemical burns. Having avenged his family by killing Blofeld and destroying Spectre, Safin continues his rampage with Ash. Safin's army pursue Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde through the woods. Though Bond kills Ash and his thugs, Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde. Safin's headquarters is located on an island between Japan and Russia, and harbours a missile base, converted to a nanobot factory, where Obruchev is mass-producing the technology so Safin can use it to kill millions of people. Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate the base. Bond kills many of Safin's men while Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes captivity while Safin lets Mathilde go. Nomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island while Bond stays behind to open the island's blast-resistant silo doors, calling a missile strike from submarine HMS Dragon to destroy the factory. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo using electromagnetic pulse in his wristwatch to overload and explode the cybernetic eye in his head. Safin ambushes Bond, shooting and infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde upon his touch. Despite his injuries, Bond kills Safin after a fight and opens the silo doors. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him. In his final moments, Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter as Bond says goodbye. The missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and killing Bond. At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q and Tanner (Rory Kinnear) drink in Bond's memory. As Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera, she tells her about her father, James Bond. Also starring Hugh Dennis as Dr. Hardy, Priyanga Burford as Dr. Symes, and Javone Prince as MI6 Security Guard. Craig makes the most of his final outing as the world's most famous spy being determined but also emotional, Seydoux (so far only the second Bond Girl to return, after Sylvia Trench) is beautiful and memorable as his lover, Lynch is reasonable in her annoyingly underwritten part, de Armas steals her scenes as the bubbly and slightly airheaded CIA agent, Malek is a bit too hammy and not very chilling as the villain, but Waltz gets a terrific Hannibal Lecter style cameo, and there is good support from Fiennes, Wright and Whishaw. It is a good story (the virus aspect being eerily relevant with the times we have lived in), filled with only occasional need for gadgets and gimmicks. It has drama and emotion, plenty of gripping chases, fights and explosive sequences, some humour, and the Billie Eilish title song (the second Bond song to hit Number One) is okay. You will notice things from previous entries popping up, including the Aston Martin V8 Volante from The Living Daylights (people have compared Craig's more aggressive Bond as similar to Timothy Dalton). But the most noticeable is the clever throwback to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with the John Barry theme heard, and the song ""We Have All the Time in the World"". The 1969 film famously ended with Bond's wife being killed, in this one, Bond dies in a genuinely sad way (he goes out with a bang, literally), and the Louis Armstrong song plays in the end credits. There will be fans that will be shocked and maybe angry at producers breaking the golden rule (Bond must never die!), but Casino Royale started with Bond earning his Double-O status, and this is a brave, poignant, and (I think) suitable conclusion to Craig's tenure. It may be two hours and three quarters long, but it didn't feel like it, the time is used well, and this is just the kind of entertainment you need, and don't worry, ""James Bond Will Return"", a terrific spy action adventure. Very good!",No Time to Die
291,7,searchanddestroy-1,"That remains a James Bond movie for me, more than Skyfall",7/10,11 October 2021,"Of course the James Bond spirit is not exactly the same as the other films over decades. It is more gloomy, darker, with a total different face of our hero. You have in this movie many unexpected things, but the overall scheme remains à James Bond movie, maybe more than SKYFALL, which was far far more a crime thriller than an OO7 feature. Watch it again and compare. In a way, SKYFALL announced this one, with SPECTRE in the middle. Not the best Bond ever, but not the worst either.

292,8,zardoz-13,Is This Curtains for Daniel Craig?,5/10,26 October 2021,"Daniel Craig delivers a robust farewell performance as 007 in the 25th James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" another long, drawn-out, often tedious extravaganza with lackluster villains capped off with a bizarre ending. Mind you, the 007 gang is all back, including Ms. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), gadget guru Q (Ben Whishaw), Chief of Staff Tanner (Rory Kinnear), CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), and 007's crusty boss M (Ralph Fiennes) Head of MI6. Bond's perpetual enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Oscar winner Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"") lurks on the periphery from his prison cell. Sadly, although he reappears here, Blofeld's screen time is far too minimal. Rami Malik's somnambulist villain Lyutsifer Safin epitomizes every Ian Fleming literary character who ever sought revenge. Worse, Safin's lack of stature in the gallery of audacious Bond adversaries doesn't serve him well. Meantime, too much of anything can be a bore, and Bond 25's biggest shortcoming is its length. Clocking in at a marathon 163 minutes, this 007 outing makes repeated allusions to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969). The least the Bond producers could have done is whittle 45 minutes off this meandering melodrama. Meanwhile, not only does Q have more than his usual number of scenes, but so also does M. Actually, M sets everything in motion with a cloak-and-dagger project codenamed Heracles that he conjured up without approval. Mind you, the $250 million budget makes ""No Time to Die"" look like a travelogue, with the scenic locales overshadowing the larger-than-life shenanigans. Indeed, ""No Time to Die"" boasts impressive production values, with Craig eager to engage his enemies with or without his license to kill. Unfortunately, little about ""Beast of No Nation"" director Cary Joji Fukunaga's entry in the cinematic Ian Fleming franchise is remarkable, except its ending. Ultimately, despite everything you may have heard to the contrary, the closing credits to ""No Time to Die"" conclude with the familiar phrase: JAMES BOND WILL RETURN. Compared with Craig's other Bond movies, ""No Time to Die"" makes Craig's most abysmal outing ""Quantum of Solace"" appear superior on several counts.""No Time to Die"" unfolds in the past, with Madeleine Swann as a child (newcomer Coline Defaud), living with her mother (Mathilde Bourbin of ""Louise""), in a remote but picturesque domicile in the middle of a snow-swept, Norwegian forest on the edge of a frozen lake. Madeleine's mom is Mr. White's wife. Earlier, the notorious Mr. White appeared in both ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) as an enemy agent who tangled with Bond. This opening scene occurs long before either of those Bond escapades. An enigmatic stranger garbed in military apparel, wearing a Japanese Noh mask, and armed with an assault rifle, arrives at Mr. White's house. Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malik) has come to kill Mr. White because he murdered Safin's parents and family. Seeking payback, Safin has to settle for killing White's wife, since White isn't home. Madeleine manages to shoot Safin, but she doesn't kill him. Instead, fleeing from the house, she crosses onto the frozen lake, plunges through thin ice, and almost drowns. Ironically, Safin rescues Madeleine. Afterward, ""No Time to Die"" fast-forwards into the future. We learn James Bond has not only retired from MI6, but he has also fallen in love with an adult Madeleine. If you missed the previous Bond ""Spectre"" (2015), you should watch it. Meantime, the couple are vacationing in sunny Italy near the cemetery where Bond's long, lost ""Casino Royale"" lover Vesper Lynd is buried. Sentimental sap that Bond is, he visits her grave. Moments before the gravesite blows up in his face, Bond spots a business card with Spectre's symbol--an octopus--embossed on it. Naturally, Bond thinks Madeleine wanted to kill him. She didn't, but he doesn't learn this until five years later. More Spectre assassins emerge to kill our hero, but he survives their futile attempts on his life.Meanwhile, terrorists break into a secret MI6 laboratory and kidnap a scientist, Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik of ""The Snowman""), who has been developing Project Herakles, a deadly, top-secret, DNA-based bioweapon teeming with nanobots that can infect a person like a virus. Worst, Herakles was M's brainchild, and it was supposed to enable an assassin to kill a target in a crowd without harming anybody else. Eventually, Madeleine and Bond reunite when MI6 dispatches Bond to a maximum-security British prison where Blofeld is held. Madeleine (Léa Seydoux of ""The Lobster"") is Blofeld's psychiatrist. Blofeld confesses to Bond that he--not Madeleine--tried to kill him in Italy. Anything more about this elaborate plot would either be confusing or spoil the impending revelations. Like a standard issue Bond opus, our hero tracks down Obruchev and finds him on Safin's private island where the villain cultivates poisonous plants in an exotic garden. Mind you, this garden is something the writers took from Ian Fleming's second-to-last Bond novel ""You Only Live Twice.""Apart from two impressive, bullet-riddled, stunt-laden, action scenes featured in the ""No Time to Die"" trailer, nothing here will spike your blood pressure. Typically, the flamboyant villains make Bond movies memorable. Alas, Blofeld has only a couple of scenes, while Safin doesn't pose much of a physical threat. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux generate only a modicum of chemistry as lovers. The other letdown is MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch of ""Captain Marvel""), who has inherited Bond's number 007. She adds little to the fireworks that spotlight her mettle. Altogether, ""No Time To Die"" qualifies as a fair-to-middling thriller.",No Time to Die

294,10,neil-476,Terrific,10/10,20 October 2021,"Newly retired James Bond and bride Madeleine are enjoying scenic travelling despite the secrets they both know the other has. Those secrets blow the couple apart and Bond goes off the grid until - well, reasons.It is difficult to give much plot commentary without risking spoilers and, of all the Bonds, this has more potential for spoilers than any of them. So let me mention specific but non-plot items.The opening sequence is the most genuinely chilling sequence in any Bond film. The multiple nods to previous Bond - both books and films (dialogue, music, set design etc.) - are affectionate and organic rather than knowing nudges. New director Cary Joji Fukanaga shows that Sam Mendes doesn't have a monopoly on making Bond movies look gorgeous. Lea Seydoux, reprising an underwritten Madeleine, is spectacularly good. Ana De Armas features in a sequence which is huge fun, but it's not too difficult to recognise that it was shoehorned in at a late stage, because 2 lines of dialogue would have sufficed to replace it in the story.And perhaps it is fair to comment that a feature of the Craig Bonds has been each film revealing another layer like nesting Russian dolls, and the baddie here has an air of being added to extend the saga after an effective full ending at the conclusion of Spectre. But I'm not complaining because, following Craig's decision to OK, I'll do another one but no more, this is a good, good end to his five Bond films.And I'm now prepared to say that his Bond is the best screen Bond. My reason for this is that his is the only Bond who has been a human being - capable of cold suppression of emotion in order to do his job, but a real person nonetheless. The other Bonds have all been actors playing characters.I choked up at the music choice over the closing credits.",No Time to Die
295,11,gridoon2021,Craig's last Bond film is also his weakest,6/10,1 October 2021,"The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again. For such a long, bloated running time it's too talky and surprisingly short on action; in fact, there are only two other notable set-pieces, the car chase in the woods and Ana de Armas brightening up the screen as an overeager, bubbly yet skilled and deadly agent. Most of the rest of the action is uninspired, and in the climactic sequence (just a regular attack-on-the-enemy-fortress we've seen hundreds of times) often dim and murky (Tomorrow Never Dies did this sort of thing much better, and so did some of the Roger Moore Bonds). The plot is formulaic (biological weapon....again), and its treatment of several key players from previous installments disappointing. The ending is pretty silly - it leaves a mess behind that the (inevitable) next chapter will either have to work a whale of a story to get around or (more likely) will ignore altogether. Craig does succeed at embodying a very human Bond, yet I can't help but think that he never really got the chance to do a FUN James Bond living the high life: in Casino he is earning his stripes, in Quantum he is seeking vengeance, in Skyfall he is already tired and resigned, in No Time his circle comes to an end. I guess he came closest to having a good time in Spectre, which is why that film is still my favorite of the five he made. **1/2 out of 4.",No Time to Die
296,12,ferguson-6,Welcome back and Adieu,8/10,6 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Bond 25 is here, and it's quite a curtain call for actor Daniel Craig. The film's release has been postponed numerous times since September 2019, which has caused expectations and anxiety to build amongst Bond fans. It's been almost six years since SPECTRE (2015), and this is Daniel Craig's fifth and final turn as 007. This production faced challenges even before the pandemic hit. Cary Joji Fukunaga (best known for ""True Detective"" and BEASTS OF NO NATION, 2015) was hired to direct after Danny Boyle stepped down (or whatever happened), and Phoebe Waller-Bridge was brought in to spice up the dialogue on the script from Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade (the latter two having been involved in writing all five Bond movies for Craig). Of course, it's Ian Fleming to whom we stand eternally grateful for the original characters.For those accustomed to the James Bond cinematic formula, you'll notice quite a few differences - beginning with the opening scenes. Traditionally, breathtaking action kicks off the film; but this time a shift in tone and style serves up a tension-filled opening that occurs five years prior to the rest of the story. It takes a few minutes before we get the first true action sequence. Of course, we must keep in mind that we are dealing with a ""retired"" James Bond (don't worry, it's not like ""fat Thor"") ... in fact, there's already a replacement 007 and she (Lashana Lynch, CAPTAIN MARVEL, 2019) packs quite an attitude and skill set.It's his old CIA buddy, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who draws Bond back into the espionage game, and of course, the reason is to save the world (what else could it be?). This year's world-domination-seeking villain is the cleverly named Lyutsifer Safin, and he's played by Oscar winner Rami Malek (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, 2018). Safin is a low-key baddie whose weapon is a DNA-altering chemical that's probably a bit overly complex for a Bond movie, and it's also a bit strange that Safin/Malek only has a few substantive scenes. For those who saw SPECTRE, you'll recognize many of the faces, including Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner, and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Also back for a terrific scene is Oscar winner Christoph Waltz as Blofield. The new faces include the aforementioned Lashana Lynch as Nomi, Billy Magnusson as Logan Ash, and Craig's KNIVES OUT co-star Ana de Armas as Paloma. Ms. De Armas brings a jolt of energy and some smiles to the proceedings, and it's a shame her appearance is so short.It's unusual for a Bond song to win its Grammy before the movie is ever released, but that's exactly what happened for Billie Eilish's achingly somber title song. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer (THE LION KIING) delivers a wonderful score in his first Bond outing (you'll hear how he incorporates the Eilish song), and the cinematography from Oscar winner Linus Sandgren (LA LA LAND) is everything we could hope for in the action sequences (there is no shortage of bombs), as well as the quiet moments.Speaking of the quiet moments, this is undoubtedly the most sentimental and emotional of all Bond films. Sure, we get the amazing set pieces, the crazy stunts, the awesome Aston Martin (until it isn't), the cool gadgets, the wisecracks, and the shootouts - but we also get Bond at his most reflective and personal. There is a line in the film, ""Letting go is hard."" And it is ... both for Bond and for us. So welcome back and adieu, Mr. Bond. Craig. Daniel Craig.The film opens in U. S. theaters on October 8, 2021.",No Time to Die
297,13,bombersflyup,Blofeld sends his regards.,5/10,12 November 2021,"No Time to Die engages in its farewell, but still finds itself near the bottom of the heap.The opening's solid, the Billie Eilish song okay, the credits dull. Interesting plot, can relate to the COVID shot in a way. I'm surprised and disappointed Ana de Armas isn't in it more, though Lea Seydoux does a fine job. Craig's films while never among the best, aren't among the worst either. This one drops off a bit though and the PC levels set fire to what the franchise is built on and part of what makes it great. Credit that it has the ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" theme and ""We Have all the Time in the World,"" the high point of the franchise, no mention of Tracy though. Craig the usual, Waltz good as Blofeld but limited like de Armas. Negatively Malek as the bad guy doesn't give a performance and other characters including the new 007, woeful.",No Time to Die
298,14,mm-39,Better than average!,7/10,14 October 2021,"No time to die well is a must watch for Bond fans. I believe No Time to die may put to rest a much tired movie series. The first third starts out with a mystery. Why is the guy there and who is that young gal? Bond has a life of leisure with a true love, but in true Bond fashion Bond is who Bond can not live in peace. There is a memorable bad guy with one eye etc and a conflict with a mysterious girlfriend. 10 out of ten . The middle gets bogged down with the usual government loses something story line. Bond which is a non p c series has some woke characters, the over tough gal, and whippy guy flat characters which drags the story but thankfully the characters become more believable later on. The cool gadgets are back in the middle. The bad guy is interesting, but the story has predictable video game style action. Middle is 5 stars. The bottom third has the usual, eye roll, Bond count down, and Bond saves the world. Bond has a family, which does not mix with Bond's living on the edge lifestyle. Some of the Bond action is video game ish, which is bit much. The story all folds together with an interesting sub plots and a surprise ending. I give the ending a 7. Not the best ending, but a must see for Bond fans. Well directed and acted. 7 stars.",No Time to Die
299,15,Mr-Fusion,A stunning conclusion,8/10,31 October 2021,"Much has been made about No Time To Die bringing the Daniel Craig era to completion, so I'll skip past this. No, this is a perfect dose of escapism; intense, emotional and brimming with action. It picks up the best hanging threads from Casino Royale and Skyfall, throws in some callbacks to classic Bond movies and allows Craig to leave an immense mark on this franchise. I'm thankful that he didn't walk away after Spectre, and really delivered something to savor here. Given the runtime, this could've been a last gasp - but far from it. This is a joyride well worth taking.... And lest I forget, the most brilliant use of an f-bomb I've heard in a very long time. Ralph Fiennes is a treasure.

300,16,DKosty123,A Lot For All Bond Fans To Enjoy,8/10,9 October 2021,"Because of a World Wide Pandemic which in some quarters has motives like the ruin the world, James Bond is back again trying to save the world. In order to do so he must deal with the old criminal organization Spectre and Blowfeld who has been the bad guys for many years it seems. The difference here is that they are really red herrings being used by a mad man who wants to kill a majority of the world's population using a high technology bug that is programmed to kill people by their DNA.For the long time Bond fan, the biggest hint about the movie is before the opening credits. There is a long sequence where Bond tells the lovely woman he is with they have ""all the time in the world"". The theme from his Majesty's Secret Service runs through the film. It's closing credits even feature a great stereo remastering of Louis Armstrong doing the original theme from the George L (Bond) only film of the late 1960's.One strange thing in the world of Bond. Years ago Blowfeld was totally bald. This many years later he has hair. Perhaps he saw those Bosley ads for getting rid of baldness in the years after. Lea Seydoux the second French actress to be a Bond Woman in the series and Madeline for the second straight film after Spectre is indeed a tough Bond woman with a gun. Ralph Fiennes continues his role from Spectre (2015) as M. Naomi Harris is in her second straight as Moneypenny though. She played Eve in Skyfall so this is her third straight Bond and along with Maude Adams has played 2 women characters in the series. This generations regulars are all here along with a portrait of one tough special Judi Dench portrait that appears in a hallway late in the film.While the film keeps all the Fleming characters and the usual save the world plot, it is done freshly enough for even viewers not born yet when the series began to enjoy the action and the acting. Since Daniel Craig has been Bond the acting has gained more importance and balance with the action. It has been a welcome change. Each man who played Bond had different ways to do it and there were times that action and special effects took priority over acting. That has changed and is one of the strengths of this one.While the film feels like nonstop action, there is some acting here too. The ending might come as a shock to long time Bond fans, but considering this series it is something which was done in more than 1 of the Bond Films in the beginning, only this time it appears to be done for good. Spoiler- the film also discloses that Bond and Madeline have a daughter now. This is the first actual recorded sibling of Bond though there were enough scenes over the years in Bond films to suggest an episode of Maury Povich doing DNA tests on some of the other ladies he had recreation with. Finally though, yes James, you are the father.Scenery is still a big part of this and many filming locations were used in this one. This tradition has always been a part of the series. At the end it does say ""Bond will return"", but the feeling here is that the form of his return will be as a her. The set up very much looks that way. The Bond women are getting nicer curves, but that is nothing unusual. It is a concession to the times, and is welcome too. Women built thin like guys are not in style as much as years ago after so many young ladies starved themselves. Not enough of them tried to have the nice figure of Ursala Andress and we are finally making up for it.Having lived long enough to remember the late Connery, Lazenby, late Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, late Niven, late Nelson, and Craig is a feat unto itself. Nelson's Climax TV episode live performance of 007 in 1954 led to all the others. It has been an amazing road. While the plots have changed and remained the same, Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does an amazing job making this film feel like it is supposed too. Armstrong at the end is a reminder of how much has changed since all this began. Louis, we've had all the time in the world to follow Bond every step of the way.",No Time to Die

This isn't just the most plain looking James Bond movie, it's one of the most ick looking and feeling movies I've seen in a long time. So lifeless, meaningless and despite the significance of this movie - Daniel Craig's last time as Bond, so get ready for a reboot next time, I seriously cannot recommend this film to anyone.Once again, Bond has retired (I think this is his 12th retirement) and found the love of his life (also, 12th ""true love,"") but an old foe is bringing him back in for Queen and Country.I simply cannot get over how dull this movie looks and how uninterested the actors were for being here. We even had two incredible actors as Bond Villains: Christoph Waltz and Rami Malek and both svcked HARD. In fact, Rami seemingly got acting lessons from Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending. Makes sense since they're both Oscar winners and both whisper their way as sleepy villains.Admittedly there are mere moments of delightful cinematography on screen and some of the jokes landed, but there is absolutely nothing here that would/should justify the nearly 3-hour, slowly paced movie. I appreciate them adding in so many of the normal Bond tropes, and yet, even those felt like they just had to be there.I'm sure Craig got paid a lot and good for him. I didn't hate this movie like I did with Spectre, but it did make me want this Craig era to be over. Sad. When he started it all in Casino Royale, 15 years ago, he quickly became my favorite Bond (and with that movie, my favorite Bond song and overall chapter) and now I'm shooing him away and praying the next one will take its time to perfect it with someone who actually cares about playing this historic role.***Final Thoughts: At least we finally found out what ""Q"" stands for.",No Time to Die

304,20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A more than satisfying swansong for Daniel Craig as Bond,9/10,14 October 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJames Bond (Daniel Craig) has retired from active service, and is now living in Jamaica, with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), the girl from his last encounter with SPECTRE. All seems well, until a series of attempts on his life leads him to think she might be behind it. Meanwhile, in London, an armed break in at a chemical laboratory results in the apparent kidnapping of Dr. Obruchev (David Denicik.) It all leads to the path of incarcerated criminal Lyetsifer Safin (Rami Malek), setting a course for Bond and Madeleine's paths to intersect once again.It has felt like a lifetime ago now that the massive hype and eager anticipation for Daniel Craig's final Bond film was first about, before the unthinkable global pandemic struck, and the release date got set all the way back to the present day, where it has absolutely smashed global box office records. At five films, Craig has lasted the course as long as the original greats Connery and Moore, his image now as personified in the character as those whose shoes he had to fill.With that in mind, it's ironic that director Cary Joui Fukanaga pays such an homage to the Bond film starring George Lazenby, who played him only once, in the shape of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Louis Armstrong's melodic theme song We Have All the Time in the World playing over the soundtrack at various points, as well as the downbeat fatalism that defined that Bond outing from all the others. Craig's Bond has been a grittier, more hard edged Bond in general, and in its bowing out here, Fukanaga goes Hell for leather, cranking the brutal intensity of Craig's last four Bond entries all together, and giving it everything with a film running over two and a half hours, with some light humour awkwardly inserted in.It's the final part of what defines Craig's Bond, and in that it's everything you expect it to be, ur it's also a love song to the Bond franchise in general, from the more modern, unflinching stuff, right through to the 'secret organisation' stuff when it began in the 60's nearly sixty years ago, that everyone won't be able to help loving. ****",No Time to Die
305,21,MOscarbradley,Going out with a bang!,9/10,15 October 2021,"They tried to tell us it's too long and at 163 minutes ""No Time to Die"" is indeed the longest of the Bond movies but don't let that colour your judgement; this is still one hell of a rollercoaster ride and if Daniel Craig, in his final appearance as Commander Bond, is looking his age, remember he's now 'retired' and probably closer in demeanour to a middle-aged spy than at any time in the franchise. You must also remember that the Craig Bond's, unlike those of his predecessors, have followed a trajectory from ""Casino Royale"", (the first of the Ian Fleming novels), right through to the present, each one a kind of sequel to the one before and while Craig may not be everyone's favourite Bond he is, at least, unique in that respect. You might even say the entire Bond saga belongs to him.The next point to consider, of course, is is it any good or rather is it as good as the others and the answers to both questions is a resounding yes. This is an action flic of the first order, exciting, funny and, for the most part, intelligent. It's also surprisingly old-fashioned. Here is a Bond movie that goes back to the roots of the franchise, all the way to ""Dr. No"" in fact. The gadgets are still there and used to good effect but this is a much more character driven piece and in Rami Malek it has one of the great Bond villains, (could Malek become the first Bond villain to pick up an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor?).Admittedly the plot is quite far-fetched. We may not be in ""Moonraker"" territory but you may still have to see the film twice just to figure out what's going on. Also in keeping with previous Craig Bond's it's not afraid to introduce plot twists that should have a lasting impact on the series, presuming, of course, that the producers wish audiences to take any forthcoming films seriously. In what we now know will be his last appearance in the role it would be nice to say that this is Craig's film and while he certainly brings gravitas to the part it is Malek who steals the movie and if the film itself isn't quite the best of the series it's certainly up there.

All Bond movies start from the same premises and have the same hero, but the way he looks and behaves and the structuring of the story have evolved over time. This says a lot about how cinematic entertainment was and is perceived and accepted in the movies of the big studios.A lot has happened during these years. The hero evolved from the nonchalant and humorous commander in Fleming's books and played by Sean Connery to the complex and gloomy character in the last series, played by Daniel Craig. The original 007 had gone through the experience of World War II and was active during the Cold War. He was excused for his womanising as many things are excused to war heroes, and there was no room for moral doubt concerning his actions because he lived in an age when it was clear who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Thee 21st century James Bond lives and acts in the turbulent era after the fall of communism and after the novels of John Le Carre were written. Today's enemies are not ideological, and screenwriters of such films (not just those in the Bond series) often prefer not to identify them politically, ethnically, or religiously. On the other hand, the romantic implications of the character are no longer devoid of substance. James no longer conquers but falls in love. From Bond the Don Juan we now (almost) get Bond the family man. One of the qualities of the script in 'No Time to Die' is that it manages to describe at this stage of the character's evolution a story that is acceptable by today's standards of the big studios and is somewhat credible in terms of character psychology. Craig's James Bond has been throughout this series and is in this film also a real character, not just a two-dimensional comics book figure.What I liked about 'No Time to Die'? Daniel Craig. Action scenes, car chases and stunts that show ingenuity in a few moments (just when we thought we saw everything in this area) and use the landscapes spectacularly, especially in Italian villages. Humour and self-humour. The presence of Ralph Fiennes, an actor who can do anything on screen and I will like it. Ana de Armas, a classic Bond-girl who I hope will survive until the next series. What I liked less? Rami Malek, an actor who constantly disappoints me and who plays a mediocre bad guy here. Lea Seydoux is OK, but her relationship with Bond lacks chemistry. The dose of melodrama introduced in the script towards the end. The scientific pretext, which is thin and I could not understand what they were brewing in those pools (not that it would be important).'No Time to Die' honorably concludes the Daniel Craig chapter of the Bond epic. It's not the best Bond I've ever seen, but it's above average. I look forward to the next reincarnation.",No Time to Die
307,23,ThomasDrufke,Final Ascent,10/10,22 October 2021,"There's never been a more emotionally impactful Bond film and likely, there never will be again. No Time to Die doesn't have the best villain of the series, nor the best ""Bond girl"", nor the best action set piece, but it DOES have the most emotionally resonant story. This film does things with the Bond lore that I never thought would be tackled and it was beyond thrilling. Daniel Craig deserved one final bow as James Bond and he got that and more. I can't believe I'm saying this but after a few weeks of sitting on it, No Time to Die is my favorite Bond film of all time, and it's undeniably one of the best.10/10.

308,24,ericstevenson,How can you not like this?,10/10,18 November 2021,"I loved this movie if only because of the ending. What's interesting is that most of the action in the trailer only occurs in the first 21 minutes! Even more amazing is that the title doesn't come up until 21 minutes in! I think that's the longest I've ever seen in a movie. We get another great animated intro that rivals ""Skyfall""! We need guns in the shape of double helixes, obviously foreshadowing the film.This is the longest James Bond movie ever made, but it doesn't waste its time at all! So the plot is basically that Bond has retired and is with his wife when they're attacked on vacation. If there was anything that was the status quo with James Bond, it's that he could never get a wife, much less a family. Six years later, he finds out about a new organization that's targeting Spectre and decides to go back into the business, even though his 007 codename has been assigned to a woman! He meets up with his wife again who has a kid who claims it isn't his.The enemy is working on nanobot technology, that is, a microscopic weapon that can kill targets. Bond becomes infected to the point where he can't touch his wife or...yeah, it's his daughter, so he actually DIES! Yes, after 25 years of movies (and having seen every one of them) James Bond has finally been killed! I can not believe that they took this truly innovative and bold move to forever change the status quo of such a popular long running series. Apart from great locations, great characterizations and unique action, ,this masterpiece is spun together by a attempt to truly create a finale for the series. Okay, it's only for Daniel Craig's James Bond as the credits tell us that James Bond will return, but fantastic nonetheless! ****",No Time to Die
309,25,cricketbat,I still feel like Spectre would have been a fitting farewell for Daniel Craig,7/10,13 October 2021,"For the most part, I liked No Time to Die. However, I feel like it tried to do too much. They could have shaved 30 minutes off and its aim would have been more precise. I absolutely loved Ana de Armas as Paloma, though, and wish we could have seen more of her character. Without getting into spoilers, there's a finality to this film that feels somewhat out of place in the Bond franchise, but I understand why the filmmakers did it. I still feel like Spectre would have been a fitting farewell for Daniel Craig.

310,26,A_Different_Drummer,even the title gets it wrong,7/10,10 November 2021,"This is the longest running franchise in movie history and deserves your respect. This is also one of the best Bond actors. But the good news ends there. Overlong. Good opening that promises more than the film ever delivers. Works better as a soap opera featuring characters based on the Bond films than as a Bond film itself. Yes, that is faint praise. And the predictive programming about deadly nanobots will keep historians of the future busy for many decades to come.

Please don't make new 007 as women for political correctness. A new female character must be created. Anyway... I liked the movie. Honestly, I didn't like the soundtrack of the movie. Even though the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, it wasn't good, and even though it was Bille Eilish, I didn't like the music. It wasn't bad, it was fun to watch in the cinema.

312,28,851222,"Far from the best in the series, but a lot of here to enjoy",8/10,23 November 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""No Time to Die"" (2021) left me confused. No spoilers or anything, but that ending was a bit interesting, surprising and ... confusing. Anyway.As a whole ""No Time to Die"" was a hit and miss, but mostly hit for me. I liked humor in this movie and all the references to previous / past movies. Ana de Arma's short role was superb. The overall first 1 hour and 15 min were pretty amazing. Then the movie kinda dragged a bit here and there, and it could have been a bit shorter. At running time 2 h 43 min this is the longest Bond movie. And it felt. Also main villain in this movie was uninspiring. He is no were near to greats like Javier Bardem's Silva or Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre - in short he was a bit disappointing one. Also music, cinematography, special effects in this movie were superb, but you can't expect anything else for a production this caliber.Overall, ""No Time to Die"" delivered mostly goods. Not the best from last 5 movies, but far from worst. Its a solid Bond adventure, and after seeing it i wanted more.",No Time to Die
313,29,tabuno,Average for a Bond Movie,7/10,30 October 2021,"Daniel Craig's last movie as James Bond. When this movie's theme song does not have the same ""pop"" as two of the abbreviated theme songs used in No Time To Die from previous James Bond movies it does not bode well. Along with the unusual use of an extensive listing of credits in the opening credits, this Bond started off on a strange note. One of the most haunting James Bond songs used occurred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service titled ""We Have All The Time In The World"" by Louis Armstrong one of the greatest of Jazz players ever and has emotional and content relevance to this movie. No Time To Die to have had a chance to become a classic Bond Movie required a Part I and a Part II like this year's Dune (2021). Unfortunately the relational set up for Bond in this movie was way to brief to be effective and required too much mental effort to really enjoy the beginning of the movie to understand what was going on. This movie also included an explosion which did not kill for obvious but incredible reasons, a car that had more weapon-power than the multitude of munitions used on to blast away the car. The attempts at light-hearted jokes fell flat and out of character for the tone of this Bond movie. The Blofeld and Bond scene was a pale version of the amazing stark clash of mental titans in Manhunter (1986) with William Peterson (of CSI fame) and Brian Cox (as Hannibal Lecktor). The early introduction of a British operative will ""little"" training and an attempt at cuteness did not sit well with the actual amazing assault scenes she put on. Additionally the inclusion of a new 00 agent was also underdeveloped and did not get to show off much of her abilities as many earlier Bond movies. Even the sinister antagonist while strong, missed the opportunity to develop a much more complex and compelling character that could have been even more deliciously sympathetic to the audience. In summary, No Time To Die while it had potential came off relatively average for the franchise and not the best way to leave Daniel Craig with his last movie as has been previously announced.",No Time to Die
314,30,The-Sarkologist,Another Bond Film with Surprising Differences,7/10,16 November 2021,"Well, this film has been a long time coming, and I have finally managed to see it. I guess global pandemics do have an annoying ability to delay films being released, and while a number of them ended up on streaming services, it looks like James Bond really didn't want to go down that path. As such, it ended up being something like a year and a half before it actually hit the screens.One of the things that I appreciated with this film was that the trailers actually didn't end up giving too much away. In fact, most of the trailers basically dealt with the first part of the film, leaving the rest for us to enjoy, and in the end not leave with with really any spoilers that we could roll our eyes over. However, the other thing is that, like with most James Bond films, the plot basically follows your typical James Bond plot.An interesting thing that has arisen from the Craig iteration of the series is that each of the films seems to follow on from the previous films, and even reference characters as far back as the first film - namly Vesper Lynd, who has been the lover that has haunted Bond throughout the series. It also pretty much compacts Bond's life as 007 into these films, particularly since that at the beginning of this film he is basically retired, and has been forced back into action because, well, it seems as if spies like James Bond simply aren't allowed to retire.Look, I can't necessarily say that it is anything particularly outstanding, though I do have to admit that these Bond films are certainly a lot different to the previous ones, either because they have moved with the times, or they simply weren't anywhere near as cheesy as the Dalton/Brosnan films were. Actually, in part they were certainly a lot more watchable as well, even though they do require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief.However, it was still an enjoyable film, and having characters reprise their roles from previous films, which is generally the case with the agency staff, but has never really been the case with the Bond women. This is definitely different in this era, which Madeline, the psychologist from the previous film playing a pivotal role in this film. In fact, one of the best aspects of this film is that the Bond woman actually had more depth, and a background, than pretty much all of the Bond films in the past. However, the question that is still sitting at the back of mine, and in fact everybody's heads is probably where the franchise is going from here.",No Time to Die

I absolutely loved the acting and tense violence. This movie is really well filmed, had the right amount of action, cinematography is gorgeous, some goofy lines, and emotional scenes; not sure what others expected or would've preferred but this is exactly what a Bond movie should be. I must say I don't really see James Bond films in the theater I did love Spectre though Christoph Waltz was a great villain and so was Rami Malek in this one.Damn this review is getting a lot of hate that's unfortunate just cause I praised this movie.

316,32,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing...,8/10,8 October 2021,"""No Time to Die"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Léa Seydoux's who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek's who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that ""No Time to Die"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it.",No Time to Die
317,33,cruise01,"Triumphant Bond film with exciting action, direction, and Daniel Craig nails it with a high note.",10/10,10 October 2021,"(5 out of 5 Stars).No Time to Die is an awesome 25th Bond film and one of the best in the series which I would say is triumphant. It is Daniel Craigs fifth and final bond film and the story does give a proper emotional conclusion to his character story arc. I have loved every one of Daniel Craigs Bond movies. Spectre was a slight weaker. No Time to Die is awesome from story, action sequences, casting, and sharp moving direction that takes the series in a different direction which has yet to travel before.The story is awesome and epic. It follows a more retired 007 Bond (Daniel Craig). When the world is at stake again when Safin (Rami Malek) and his paramilitary group are stealing a bioweapon and weaponizing it for their evil plan. Bond is recruited by his old friend Felix (Jeffrey Wright) and having to team up with a new 007 Nomi (Lashana Lynch) to help save the world yet again.It is best to avoid spoilers to where the story goes. And the surprises is best seen on screen than reading it. James Bond does go on a more emotional journey. With past secrets from the people he loves coming out.The film does have a lot of fantastic action sequences that are exciting and breathtaking. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga did a great job in handling the action scenes. Car chases, shoot outs, and fight scenes are well done. The opening sequence takes a different direction from any other Bond movies. It is one of the longest sequence that shows a dark eerie tone of a characters past and introduction to the villain. And than flashing towards the present with Bond and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) on a getaway in Italy. Only moments later, the past catches up to them. Putting them in a thrilling car chase.There is a lot of exciting action and chases. Bond coming across Paloma (Ana de Armas) was a fun fight sequence with her. And Lashana Lynch is a fun new addition as 007. Rami Malek is a great menacing and tormenting villain with an evil agenda plan towards the world.The cast ensemble is great. Daniel Craig will forever be the best bond ever. It was a fitting end with this movie that does take for an emotional journey and a well deserved ending. Lea Seydoux was great playing his love interest. Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes all did great.The direction is different for a bond film but great in an exciting new chapter. It is dark and emotional. And action packed throughout. For a run time that is almost three hours, the film felt short and fast paced. Billie Eilish bond theme song in the credit sequence was great and dark and eerie. It worked with the tone of the film. A great new addition is the music score by Hans Zimmer that amped up the Bonds music score. Even has a tiny reference to Majesty Secret Service film.No Time To Die is one of the best films of the year. And best bond films that takes the franchise in a different and dark direction. While ending a characters story arc.",No Time to Die
318,34,zkonedog,The Best Since Casino Royale--But Still Not Saying Much,6/10,13 October 2021,"It is clear right from the beginning that ""No Time to Die"" has a plan. That alone makes it better than half the Bond films ever made. Unfortunately, despite being fairly entertaining overall, Daniel Craig's swan song in the role is filled with lofty ideals undercut by horrible execution.For a very basic overview, ""No Time to Die"" sees Bond (Craig) seemingly enjoying a post-007 life with Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux). Of course, as so often happens, things go awry and the lovers are pulled back into the espionage game, largely courteous of the enigmatic Lyutsifer Safin (Remi Malek) and a viral terrorism scheme.I'll begin with what this movie does well, as it does possess some redeeming qualities for sure:-Craig remains a great Bond. That hasn't changed since we first saw him in 2006.-Ana de Armas is one of the best ""Bond girls"" (to use that phrase loosely) in the history of the franchise. Her character is a shot in the arm midway through the film.-Because this was Craig's confirmed last don of the tuxedo, director Cary Joji
Fukunaga was able to arc the plot lines to a resolute climax. Absolutely no indecision on that front.-In typical franchise fashion, it provides enough thrills and spectacle to be watchable. You won't be nodding off or anything like that. Truth be told, while walking out of the theater this was more of a 7-star effort.After some further cogitation, however, it is fairly obvious that ""No Time To Die"" suffers from some pretty serious faults, all centered upon this premise: great ideas, horrible execution of them.Some examples:-The opening villain scene? Tremendous--one of the best Bond opens ever. The villain is then hardly referenced at all for close to an hour (if not longer).-Having James Bond fall in love with a woman instead of objectifying/using one is interesting--but not enough time is spent on that topic and I'm not sure if Seydoux (or her character writing) is up to that dramatic task.-Teasing a black, female 00 agent? Again, could have been something really meaningful but instead used only as a wink-and-nod to the camera.-Bond--the most famous big screen womanizer of all-time--as a girl Dad? Very intriguing--so of course utterly ruined by the filmmakers initially telling viewers point-blank ""she isn't Bond's daughter"", and then at the end saying ""oh yeah--she actually was Bond's daughter all along"". Embarrassingly plotted in that sense.-As previously mentioned, de Armas was the best part of this film (at least for me). The epitome of incredible beauty but also precipitating the best action sequence in all of ""No Time to Die"". Predictably, following the pattern here, she appears for maybe 15-20 minutes and is never seen again. Head-scratching.For a film that clocks in at a bloated two hours and 40 minutes, it is a little hard to believe that all the above great concepts were still given short shrift. But that is exactly what happens in ""No Time to Die"". It spends all its time introducing these little nuggets, but none actually following through on them in a compelling way.So, while it was certainly nice to have a big movie spectacle back in theaters as the world claws out of a pandemic, those are the circumstances for which I'll likely remember ""No Time to Die"". It certainly won't be for its tight plots or well-developed characters.",No Time to Die
319,35,eddie_baggins,"Worth the (extra!) long wait, Craig's farewell to Bond is big, silly and a whole lot of fun",8/10,11 November 2021,"After over a year of patient extra waiting due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Bond fans can finally say farewell to the Daniel Craig 007 era that started all the way back in 2006 with the series revival that was Casino Royale, as Craig and director Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time to Die arrives onto our cinema screens.Six years have passed between martini's, with 2015's so-so Spectre now a distant memory and Die wastes no time kicking things off here with a bang that is every bit as good as the famous opening stanza from Casino Royale, setting the tone very quickly for a film that becomes a fitting swansong to the new age Bond audiences have been treated too over the last fifteen years.At almost three hours in length, Die has a lot of ground to cover and the time to do it as Bond is once more drawn out of ""retirement"" to battle old enemies and mysterious new foes that have emerged to threaten the world order and with so many elements needing to be explored and covered off for closure of the Craig inhabited agent, not all of the components of Fukunaga's epic work but there's enough here that does to ensure that this bloated but often thrilling blockbuster is a top quality affair.As good as his ever been in the role, Craig is clearly enjoying his time here (even more so when you consider he appeared done with the role after Spectre) and he shares some great scenes and chemistry with return players such as Ralph Fiennes M, Ben Whishaw's Q, Jeffrey Wright's Felix and Léa Seydoux's Madeleine, while his all too short mission with the scene stealing Ana de Armas as Paloma makes one wish that the two actors were given more too do across Die's globe spanning narrative.The quality of performances on show and the brilliantly designed spectacles produced by Fukunaga and his D. O. P Linus Sandgren with accompaniment of the films composer Hans Zimmer often carries Die a long way past its weaker areas that are fairly easy to identify as the slightly tedious and mediocre middle stretch, the extremely daft overall villainous plot that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny and the waste of Rami Malek as much hyped new villain to the saga Lyutsifer Safin, who makes a great entrance but spends most of the films runtime in the shadows only to appear and disappoint in the end game with the Oscar winning actor unable to make any in roads into the film to enhance it to greatness.Had the film managed to deliver a plot worthy of its lead character and given him a devious baddie to savor, its very likely that Die could've laid a good claim to being as every bit as good as the critically adored Casino Royale and Skyfall and made a valid argument to be regarded as the standout Craig feature of the brand.One of the years most well-filmed and produced blockbusters and one that provides a lot of viewing pleasures if you can forgive its collection of over the top elements, underdeveloped ideas and forgettable big bad, ending the modern day Bond with a bang, Die has done a fine job finishing up Craig's tenure in the shoes of the worlds most famous agent.Final Say -A blockbuster farewell to the Bond many have come to know and love, No Time to Die is big, silly and a whole lot of fun and has proven too be an event worth the long buildup as we now eagerly await to see what direction Ian Fleming's famous creation is taken in the future.4 unscathed car tyres out of 5.",No Time to Die

The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn't made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn't that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn't a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn't have even noticed the jokes. It's also about twenty minutes too long. ""No Time to Die"" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig's not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.

322,38,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Blockbuster Entertainer! This Action-filled extravaganza gives a grand farewell to Daniel Craig's Bond Series.,7/10,1 October 2021,"No Time To Die (2021) :
Movie Review -When it comes to spy-films you already know how some things are gonna turn. Sometimes you even know about it before watching the film that it is gonna be send-off or some other kind of event as stated by the team or media. Whether it is Mission Impossible series or James Bond series (Daniel Craig's), some things are bound to look predictable or rather just say that the filmmaker want them to look so because that's what die hard fans love watching. For some people it becomes too mainstream and that's exactly what has happened with this film. The love factor, husband-wife bond, daughter/son and then hero who plays a father and a Husband sacrifices his life etc. These all things are too mainstream now and if you believe so then you and me have something in common. Rest, die hard fans will find it overwhelming naturally but that's because they don't know that these formulas were born in 40s and 50a decade in Hollywood. Nevertheless, excluding that corny side of the narrative No Time To Die offers a blockbuster entertainer with superb high-tech action extravaganza.Bond has left active service and his wife Madeline and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. There is new OO7 to give us that jealous vibes but only for a short time and then we get our main OO7 back even though 'It is just a number'. Like i said, the same husband-wife and Father-daughter formula spoils the engagement here but thankfully it goes well by the end when you see it is being crafted into emotional send-off.Daniel Craig as Bond is very specific about his style this time. He looked little aged but he suits the attitude of the iconic character because it is a tailor-made thing for him. Rami Malek could have made a terrific villain but he is too mild here and completely wasted. In female toles, Léa Seydoux and Lashana Lynch are top performers while rest of the cast is extremely supportive in their own manners. No Time To Die starts-off with a pacy and explosive mode and you don't even check at your watch for an hour. Then, slow section in the second half makes it look little longer than expected but fortunately does not bore you.All the action sequences in the film are pleasant sights to eyes. The entire team has done a fabulous job and what a breathtaking high-tech action it presents.. Simply Outstanding! Watch out for the chase sequence in the beginning only that will immediately glue you to your seats. The screenplay drags a little in the middle but otherwise fine. Dialogues aren't that conversational but fairly decent. Background score is chilling. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga has given a complete package, in which, viewers with different demands will find what they are seeking. That's quite a job you know. Overall, a grand-style farewell to one of the most iconic character of modern action cinema and every James Bond Fan is gonna love it.RATING - 7/10*",No Time to Die
323,39,Fella_shibby,"The function of Bond is to entertain, not to search for a befitting closure. Nonetheless, as a fan of Bond movies n Craig, i am generous with an 8.",8/10,12 November 2021,"This is the twenty-fifth in the Bond series n the fifth and final to star Daniel Craig as James Bond.This time Bond is approached by his old CIA friend, Felix Leiter who ask for Bond's help in finding Obruchev, a scientist who developed a bioweapon with the approval of M.Initially Bond refuses but later agrees to help Leiter against the wishes of a new MI6 agent.I dont kno why Bond did that. Maybe for brotherhood.Also why wud M and MI6 lab wud approve bioweapons that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others.I loved the locations of Matera in the opening scene but the trailer gave away the bike jump scene but it is still amazeballs.Ther is not enuff action in this one inspite of the 160 mins runtime.The Orland Nato base scene is beautifully shot.This time Bond faces Lyutsifer Safin who eventually will go down in the history books as the one who brought 'peace' between the Bond n Blofeld universe.But Rami Malek's character as Safin isn't intimidating, poignant or terrifying. His acting ain't upto mark.Bond also faces Primo, a dumb henchman who gets fooled by a woman in a typical way.This time Bond doesn't flirt as he is shown as a family man but we do have some sexy ladies.We have the sexy Ana de Armas as Paloma who looked illecebrous in a navy Michael Lo Sordo gown.We also have the hottie Lashana Lynch.I am still thinking why wud Bond ditch the house in Jamaica which is closer to nature.

324,40,imseeg,BEWARE: the jokes are gone! No actor's chemistry either. No great villain either. Lasts too long. And worst of all it is kinda boring to watch.,5/10,1 October 2021,"BEWARE: this director only has made 2 lovey dovey, sentimental arthouse movies beforehand. Those movies were quite good actually, but somehow this director destroyed all the classic Bond vibes:1
The jokes are gone. What is a Bond film without some funny oneliners? NOTHING.2
There is NO villain to speak of. What is a Bond film without a great, mean villain? NOTHING.3
The Bond girl is pathetic. No actor's chemistry whatsoever. And the few great supporting actors have too little screentime to make an impression. What is a Bond film without a smashing Bond girl? NOTHING.4
It lasts too long. Bond movies tend to be about 2 hours, but this edition is stretching the length to 2 hours and 45 minutes! It becomes tedious to watch in the middle. What is a Bond film without excitement and a fast paced story? NOTHING.5
James Bond has become a girly picture. Everybody is complaining about that. James Bond used to be butch and mischievous and a womanizer. Now James Bond has become a girl...This latest Bond edition started out as a disaster. The first director (Danny Boyles) got fired and they had to start all over again, without any script to speak of. When the new director (who had ZERO action movie experience) was hired, he had to create a new script WHILE making the movie. That's asking for problems. When the producers previewed the end result they found it to be too gloomy and lacking in humor. Then Daniel Craig started demanding that the female screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge was to be hired, in order to polish up the script and reshoot several scenes to make the movie a bit less gloomy.No time to Die is the first Bond movie since the sixties, that was co-written by a female screenwriter. Yes, only the very first two Bond movies were co-written by a woman as well. And those were terrific classics. And now Phoebe Waller-Bridge was hired in (at the command of Daniel Craig) to polish up the script, in order to make the characters more likeable and relatable and a bit more funny as well. And what did we get? Dialogues like the following: ""I love you. I love you too"". That's cringeworthy. Expect a lot of that...""James Bond WILL RETURN"". That is mentioned at the very end of the credits. Will the next Bond be a woman? Daniel Craig says NOT. But what does he know...?",No Time to Die
325,41,southdavid,"Shaken, rarely stirred.",7/10,6 October 2021,"Having revisited the previous Daniel Craig Bond films in preparation, we went to the Cinema to see ""No Time to Die"" last weekend. I found the film to be reasonably good, and I liked the tone, which felt like it was a genuine ending for many of the characters, but I did feel the extended run time, especially in the middle section of the film.Unable to trust Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) James Bond (Daniel Craig) ends their relationship following an attack by SPECTRE. Several years later, a retired Bond is asked to help locate a missing scientist by his old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The investigation puts him at odds with MI6 and specifically their new 007 (Lashana Lynch) but Bond's ties to this mission run much deeper than he could have foreseen.I liked the performances in ""No Time to Die"". Daniel Craig's tiredness with the role reflects well with an aging Bond seemingly relatively settled into (yet another) retirement before being pulled back in for one last job. I get that some people don't enjoy the ""moodiness"" of Lea Seydoux's Madeline, but it's fitting for a relatively sad life, that's been integrated with murder since childhood. The two new agents are a lot of fun and particularly Ana De Armas' Paloma is an all too short burst of life in the film. The practical driving effects are really well done, and they seem to be the majority of the stunt work in this one, perhaps to reflect the damage the role has done to it's lead.But as I say, I could feel the length of the film particularly in the middle, where the action sags. Rami Malik proves another dull, polite, reasonable villain for the franchise and I never really got to grips with why he wanted to go further, once he achieves his entirely reasonable goal. (Trying to keep that as spoiler free as I can).I like the melancholy sense that pervades the film, that the end is nigh for all these characters and that the hard reboot is coming and though it has its moments, it's not a film I can see me revisiting again too often.",No Time to Die
326,42,paul-allaer,The end of an era (on many levels),7/10,11 October 2021,"""No Time To Die"" (2021 release; 162 min.) is the 25th release in the long-running James Bond franchise. As the movie opens, young Madeleine watches in horror as an assassin murders her mother. In a clever montage, young Madeleine morphs into today's Madeleine as Bond's, James Bond's, girlfriend. They are in Italy where Bond visits the grave of Vesper Lynd, but before we know it, someone is out to kill Bond. Mayhem ensues... At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the 25th James Bond movie seemed snake-bitten from the start. The movie started developing in early 2016, yes almost 6 years ago. Creative differences led to the departure of the original director and then the original screenwriters, and for good measure eventually also the original soundtrack composer. Once filming started, there were more delays due to Craig Daniel's injury. Then when the movie was FINALLY completed and readied for release (in April, 2020), a little thing called COVID-19 brought the entire film industry onto it knees. Now 18 months later the movie is finally released. Would anyone still care? Well, I did. Was it worth the wait? It was, sorta. The good things: as we've known for years, this is Daniel Craig's swan song as 007 and he relishes his last stab at it, with fervor and dogged determination. Bond will not be denied! The production, locations and photography are first class, per the usual. (The scenes in Matera, Italy now make me to want to go visit this town and see it for myself.) Léa Seydoux reprises her role from Spectre and does quite well again. As for the not so good: the movie is at least 20 min too long for its own good (at almost 2hrs. 45 min. It is by far the longest Bond film ever). The plot is byzantine yet the evil that threatens the world is surprisingly simple. Rami Malek is one of the lamest/tamest ""bad guys"" ever in Bond history. Where the Bond franchise goes from here (if anywhere at all), truly nobody knows. If on the other hand this is it for James Bond, then this was a worthy last stand. Far from perfect, ""No Time To Die"" is nevertheless an entertaining and worthy addition to the Bond franchise.""No Time To Die"" opened in theaters this weekend after a 1 1/2 yr delay. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I'm guessing about 50 people--in a theater that seats about 2 or 3 times that many). Indeed, the box office weekend gross was only $56 million, far below expectations. Given the production cost of ""No Time To Die"" (a reported $250-300 mill, add to that the advertising budget), and one must wonder if a movie of this magnitude is still possible. One thing is clear: the viewing habits of audiences have changed dramatically since COVID-19, and possibly or even likely, will never return to what they were pre-COVID. It all feels like the end of an era, to be honest. All that aside, if you are a James Bond fan, I encourage you to check it out, hopefully in the theater (for the maximum viewing experience), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",No Time to Die
327,43,subxerogravity,Fun movie! Going back to the old school Bond?,8/10,8 October 2021,"The thing about Daniel Craig's version of Bond is that it tells an origin story about how James Bond became 007, and they did this in a really serious manner that coincided with the success of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy that meshed up being real and being dark, but as Craig started to become more and more the Bond, we all know, the serious tone began to chip away a little. This was actually good for Craig because he got to show a lot more personality as his Bond movies moved on.Spectre for me was the completion of Craig's Bond. You did not have to go any further than this. Not to say that No Time to Die is not a great movie and should not have been made but it was a huge risk because Spectre was when Craig fully became Bond in my book.Though No Time To Die, as it turns out was not just an episode in the Bond series, it would mean far more than that, for the most part it took Bond even further back to his grass roots than Skyfall.More gadgets than in any other Craig led bond or rather the gadgets went back to that extreme we remember in the old days with an Aston Martian that projected spike balls and had machine gun headlights. In the Casino Royale days it was more important to make the gadgets as real as possible, but I feel like we actually live in a world where technology is to the point where we can believe easily that a dude can have an eye similar to Steve Austin's in the Six-million-dollar man.Speaking of which, No Time to Die has an evil henchman that goes up there with characters like Jaws, Odd Job and Nic Nac. I did love Dave Bautista in Spectre but his Bond Villain was still on a real serious tone while the dude they got up in here is a little more playful a character. I will say that Rami Malek as the main villain could have used far more screen time.I think Lea Seydoux is the first bond girl to return and make another movie officially, so that's history. It's also saying something about the type of Bond Craig has always been over the other Bonds, starting with Casino Royale. I will say that Ana De Armas may have redefined a Bond girl as they are saying, but she's no Michelle Yeoh. In no fault of her own because she did good...with the very little amount of time they gave her, but she did make every moment count.What truly hope they intent on trying to keep was the new 007, Nomi. Now when it comes to Bond...Women, that was different and cool to watch.Last I wanted to note Billie Eilish being selected to sing the Bond theme song was such a cliché on pop culture. I'm not trying to insult someone who I never listened to but I found it fascinating that the moment I heard the song I knew it was Eilish without even hearing her sing ever.Overall, if this is going to be Craig's last time behind the Bond wheel he did go out at top speed. It's a good movie.",No Time to Die
328,44,jtindahouse,A game-changing film that is almost impossible to fault,10/10,10 October 2021,"Wow! I can see why the filmmakers were adamant this film be released at a time when the most people possible would be able to see it in theatres. It's a damn masterpiece. I actually wasn't ready for how good this film was. It caught me off guard in the best way possible.The first thing you'll notice when watching this movie is that it's not afraid to break the rules. Everything that you love about Bond films is present, but at the same time a lot of things are just a little bit different. The opening scene to this film is absolutely incredible, but it breaks Bond tradition. I loved that. It gives a sense of uniqueness while also ensuring the die-hard traditionalists won't be disappointed.The cast were incredible. Rami Malek nailed it as 'Safin' exactly like I knew he would. He was born to be a Bond villain. Ana de Armas was terrific in the little time we actually got with her. I didn't realise it was going to be such a small role and kept hoping she would come back. She nailed it and looked like she had so much fun doing it. Give her a spin-off I say.Finally, Daniel Craig. What an amazing ride it has been with him as James Bond. He was born to play the role. He may not have loved every minute of the journey but it never once effected his on-screen performance. He will be missed but his legacy as Bond will live on forever I suspect.The film is nearing three hours long, however the credits are rolling before you know it. The pacing is insanely good. The film never stops. I also loved how easy it was to follow. Sometimes I find Bond films get a little too complex in their plots and it can take away from the enjoyment. That was never the case here. I knew exactly where we were and why we were there at all times.I can't say enough good things about this film. If you are on the fence about seeing it, thinking perhaps that it will just be another run of the mill Bond film, I would implore you to see it. It is a game-changer. 10/10.",No Time to Die

It's been 5 years since Daniel retired as a 00 agent-and the end of the last movie-when Jeffrey, his old C. I. A. Buddy Felix Leiter, shows up needing his help. A new bad guy, Rami, is wanting to unleash a biochemical weapon that targets a person by their DNA and Daniel is the only one that can stop him. Daniel meets his replacement, Lashana, that is using his old designation 007-it's just a number, remember-and Lea plays his love interest during his retirement. Lea & Rami also have a connection. As is the case, people have their secrets and Daniel has his work cut out for him on who he can trust and it's not long before bad guys start popping up on motorcycles and fast cars, trying to kill Daniel. There are surprise deaths-both good guys & bad guys-and a surprise ending that has never been done before in a James Bond movie-and believe me, I've seen them all. If you listen to the soundtrack closely, you will hear a familiar song from a previous Bond movie-On Her Majesty's Secret Service-and of course, the usual notice is after the end credits, 'James Bond Will Return'. It just won't be with Daniel Craig.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 43 minutes.I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",No Time to Die

333,49,alindsay-al,A Great Satisfying end to Craig's time as Bond,8/10,2 October 2021,"After 4 films and 15 years we are finally at the end of Daniel Craig's run as James Bond with No Time To Die and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Bond attempting to start a new life with Madeleine when he is dragged back into the fray.Main Character
Daniel Craig has been James Bond for so long and you can tell he really wanted to go out on a high and he does a fantastic job here. He really gives it his all and manages to combine the charisma and grit that has defined his time as the character, this might even be his best performance in the role. The character goes through a lot in this film and you see just how much he has progressed since Casino Royale and real credit has to go to Craig for that.Supporting Characters
I admitted that I wasn't a huge fan of Lea Seydoux's character of Madeleine in Spectre but I thought she did a much better job here. I actually bought the chemistry between her and Craig and the whole romance option was much improved and it actually provided a lot of great dramatic moments. Lashana Lynch plays a new 00 here and she is also great, I really liked her competition with Bond and how her character shows how the world has changed even since the Craig films started. Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, Ben Whishaw and Jeffery Wright reprise there roles from previous films and they are all great and actually get some decent screen time and plenty to do. I also just wanted to give a shoutout to Ana De Armas, she is barely in the film but she gives a really great performance and is so fun and likeable, it is just a shame there wasn't more of her here. Rami Malek plays the villain here and you can tell he is clearly trying, but the character is so poorly written that it gives him no chance, at the end his acting isn't the issue but this is a weak villain for sure.Story
The film delivers a really good and personal story for James Bond and the characters that are around him. It feels like a big deal and the chemistry between the characters is what drives it through and things are just improved from some of the other films. But the issue is that there is just too much here and some doesn't make much sense, take the bad guys plan, it makes zero sense and it makes it hard to care about that element of the film. The story could have been tightened up and shortened the run time which would have benefitted the overall film.Script
The script is great, there is some real drama here that adds real depth to the characters and there individual stories. But the playfulness and slight bits of humour are there too and it really builds this great script that will keep you invested in this really long film.Style
The action scenes are great, they have been the biggest strength of Craig's time in the role and they are once again great with the stakes being really high and the stunts really delivering. But the biggest issue in the film is the length, its nearly 3 hours long and it really doesn't need to be, if the plot had been more cohesive you could have shaved plenty of time off of the film.Overall
Overall, No Time To Die is a great film that ends Craig's time in the role in a satisfying and enjoyable way that is a good time in the cinema.",No Time to Die

335,51,Chris_Docker,Licensed to make-over,7/10,3 October 2021,"This is a well-made if formulaic continuation of a franchise - one that cannot afford a disaster. It has all the elements of fast cars, exciting chases, a contemporary plot intended to strike terror, some attractive ladies and a nice sprinkling of hi-tech.Daniel Craig does an admirable job with the material given him - the ageing Bond pulled out of retirement - and although it just about covers his physical appearance it falls short elsewhere. What it doesn't have is the original character of Bond as created by Ian Fleming. Bond in his retirement, it seems, has suffered a woke makeover.

This is certainly better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre and up there with Skyfall and Casino Royale in terms of quality. This one shows the usual tough Bond, but this time with a tad more gentleness and romance and much more a creature of this century.There is good support all around as usual with a particularly enjoyable turn by Ana de Armas as a effervescent young CIA agent and Lashana Lynch as the 00 agent who covered for Bond in his absence.On the slightly negative side, Rami Malek as the main villain is a bit weird and not totally convincing and it does drag slightly in the 2nd act. These are though minor quibbles in a strong and enjoyable thriller which in many ways is less Bond-like than many before it. It is great fun and not to be missed.",No Time to Die

338,54,kluseba,An appropriate conclusion to Daniel Craig's era,9/10,14 October 2021,"No Time to Die is the twenty-fifth movie in the James Bond series created by Eon Productions. This is also the longest of these movies. It's the fifth and final movie with Daniel Craig and concludes the more emotional and personal sequence of films on a very high note.This film convinces on several levels. Without revealing too much, this movie brings the person James Bond to life more authentically than most other films except for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Casino Royale and Skyfall. The movie has a dramatic depth that might make quite a few viewers shed a few tears towards the end.The movie introduces several interesting side characters. Lashana Lynch convinces as new agent with cool, resilient and tough charisma. Ana de Armas has an impressive cameo as bubbly agent who seems nervous at first contact but focused when put in danger.The locations have been chosen with care before the madness of the pandemic occurred. The film moves from the snow-covered landscapes of Norway over isolated islands in the Pacific to heated soils of Italy. In this regard, the film certainly offers something for every taste.The plot is a spy thriller by the numbers which means that those who don't like the genre won't change their minds with this movie while genre enthusiasts get exactly what they could expect which is a relief in troubled times like these.There are few negative things to mention. Even though Rami Malek is doing a decent job at portraying a tormented villain, his character could have benefitted from some additional background information and further scenes.Another thing that hasn't impacted the rating but that needs to be pointed out is that the release strategy of this movie has been absolutely dreadful which cannot just be excused by the pandemic. It's great that a movie that was so difficult to make turned out to be so amazing but it should have already been released more than two years ago as I'm writing these lines. I hope that the next entry in the series will come around much faster.At the end of the day, No Time to Die is in the top section of James Bond movies and a rewarding conclusion to the sequence of films starring Daniel Craig that have featured a more emotional, personal and vulnerable agent. The mixture of action, crime and drama is balanced, captivating and entertaining. So far, in a year that hasn't had many cinematic highlights, No Time to Die qualifies as the greatest movie of the year.",No Time to Die

340,56,masonfisk,"TAKE A BOW MR. CRAIG, TAKE A BOW...!",10/10,26 October 2021,"Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond. Taking place five years after the events of Spectre, we find Craig has quit the Secret Service, broken off things w/Lea Seydoux (due to a belief she had betrayed him) but as the running time dictates, we know Craig will suit up one more time (accompanied humorously by Lashana Lynch who becomes the new 007 much to Craig's chagrin) to fight off a new foe, played by Oscar winner Rami Malek, who has his own axe to grind against Blofeld's (once again played by Christoph Waltz) horde (they killed his family years ago) & manages to decimate their ranks. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation/Sin Nombre), who I believe may be the first Yank to direct a Bond entry (remember when Pierce Brosnan wanted Quentin Tarantino to direct one & the Bond producers said no) w/his usual expert eye on composition & framing w/an ending which is wholly satisfying to Craig's arc throughout his reign (I wouldn't want to be in the planning room for where Bond goes next). Also starring Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q, Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny, Rory Kinnear as Tanner & last but certainly not least Ana De Armas & Jeffrey Wright as a Cuban agent & Felix Leiter respectively.",No Time to Die
341,57,drystyx,Little girl saves the film,7/10,21 October 2021,"Plot, Bond saves the world, and some people, notably a little girl instead of a damsel in distress, which actually makes this more interesting than the other Craig 007 films.My brother said he'd wait till it goes to TV, and he was right. Not that it was bad. Just that the big screen didn't really matter for this. You get just as much, probably more, on a small screen, and it could be that is what this director was going for, since everything about the scenery and sound fit better for TV than a big screen.There was some pretty good scenery, but the cinematography was poor. Even the rocky cliffs looked drab. And there were too many ""high rise"" and ""street"" and ""bar"" and ""office"" and ""home"" and ""motor vehicle"" shots, the six most boring and least cinematographic sceneries possible.And the actors were horrible. Not so much in acting as in communicating. Not one could enunciate half his or her words. This needs to be seen on TV with subtitles, because there is no way to possibly understand more than a third of the lines being spoken.Yes, that's true. But you do catch the gist of it.It was the best of the Craig movies at 7/10, which is nothing to brag about, but at least it wasn't as depressing and full of ""hate the audience"" as Casino Royale, the movie made for the ""haters"" who love to torture their friends and families.What really saved this movie was the little girl. I don't recall a 007 film where the ""damsel in distress"" is instead a child. I'm sure he's saved children, but this time the child takes center stage, and it saves the movie from its terrible camera work and terrible cinematography.One thing this new director does well is tone down the usual Hitler worship of Purvis and Wade, who are toned down on their desire of killing as many dark haired women as possible. They still do it, but it's toned down. Purvis and Wade are not even close to being subtle about their Neo Nazi ideology. But that's what is published and produced by the mostly Nazi producers in Hollywood.There are some things to like. One weird thing is the woman who has second billing on imdb has about a ten minute stretch of nice action in the film, and then goes on her way. She's a Brazilian spy who becomes the eye candy of the film, and gives us a great leg show.The other women are mostly ""nice looking"". Bond's love interest, in fact, has a girl next door look, or looks like your cousin. It gives the sentiment that Bond isn't superficial, but down to Earth in family life.The new 007 girl is very good, and should make a good future 007 IMO, but it all depends on the script and the scenery.This one had a decent enough script, I guess, except who knows since you can't hear 2/3 of the lines.Sometimes, the actors and actresses speak them too fast. There's no excuse for that. Was the director rushing them through lines? No one can possibly interpret lines that fast.The action scenes are filmed too fast as well.What saves the film is the little girl. Saving the little girl makes it a breath of fresh air. But does he save her? Does he fail? You know better than that. 007 haven't gone that far to please the haters.",No Time to Die

Some for the first time but most were rewatches.Having now seen all 25 , I have come to some conclusions that not everyone will agree with .These are my thoughts.Connery as Bond and his films were overrated. I almost found them creepy and not in a good way . The worst Bond was George Lazenby yet On Her Majesty's Secret service is a great story.Roger Moore was a great Bond and his films were the most fun of any .Timothy Dalton didn't have the personality to pull of the role but his films weren't bad . The opposite is the case for Pierce Brosnan . He had the looks and the sophistication but the films were lousy . Then we come on to Daniel Craig . Without doubt in my mind , the best James Bond we have ever seen and he also features in the best 007 film ever made in Skyfall.That is until now...James Bond has left active service. His peace is short-lived when Felix Leiter, an old friend from the CIA, turns up asking for help, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.What a magnificent ending to the Daniel Craig era . This is a fantastic movie . Forget about it being a Bond film , it's the best film I've seen in 2021.It's nearly three hours long but it doesn't feel like it. The blend of action and dialogue is just about right and director , Cary Joji Fukunaga has produced the ultimate 007 film .It's hard to go into what happens because there really are some massive shocks in store but needless to say , this feels different to anything that has come before .The female characters are not just there to be sexual fodder for James , they are there to work alongside him in equal measure .All three Bond Girls ( can we even call
Them that anymore?) are great .Ana De Armas , Lea Seydoux and especially Lashana Lynch who brilliantly plays the other 00 .The story is nice and easy to follow and the ending will stay with me for a very long time .There are nods to On Her Majesty's Secret Service all the way through the film and when you see it , you will see why .Absolutely Fantastic.",No Time to Die
344,60,masonsaul,Incredible conclusion,10/10,5 October 2021,"No Time To Die is an incredible conclusion to Daniel Craig's run as 007 that's suitably epic, thrilling and fun whilst also being surprisingly extremely emotional and tying up as many loose ends as it can.Daniel Craig is reliably perfect once again with plenty of charisma. Léa Seydoux, Lashana Lynch, Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and Jeffrey Wright are all great. Rami Malek is really good and Ana de Armas is also great in her small part.Cary Joji Fukunaga's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed, extremely stylish and visually slick with amazing action scenes. It's well paced and both the music by Hans Zimmer and the song by Billie Eilish are excellent.

345,61,rgkarim,No Time To Waste Leaving Anything Unexplained: Fun Film Of The Bond Repertoire,8/10,8 October 2021,"LIKES:Great Opening:
Bond movies often start with action that is primarily meant to get you wrapped into the movie with big bangs. However, this Bond takes things differently and helps add to the story and continuation from the last film. The opening starts laying down the framework quite well, alongside some foreshadowing, and adds the personal character quality Bond films sometimes lack. Throw in the artistic Bond songs that Craig's legacy is accompanied by and it's a promising start to the film.Emotional/Character Driven:
Craig's movies have held a lot more personal connections with his Bond than others I have seen (though I have many to still watch), and this film was certainly a lot more charged on character development. The alliances, friendships, and rivalries go rather deep in the film and seeing them tested added more layers past the usual sleeping/shooting/spying elements that Bond is famous for displaying. Though a little overdramatic at times, this extension of character was nice to have in this movie and helped up some of the stakes in the movie, always a nice way to get engaged.The Costumes/Setting:
Bond is the international man of mystery and that often means exotic locations, interesting settings, and glorious costumes to bring the poise that Bond holds. No Time To Die continues the trend of immersing you in the spy business by taking us across the globe and getting a very small taste of the culture and beauty. Some of these settings are breathtaking venues, outside in the natural splendor of the countryside and towns. Others, are your typical strongholds for the Bond villain, the battlegrounds for spy vs. Terrorist to match wits and bravado. They all felt very Bond to me, and once populated with the extras, only further helped immerse us into the high class world of Bond. The dresses and tuxes were stunning as ever when they emerged, and seeing some of the cool spyware to decorate Bond's action suit were always fun to relive in seeing what the creative minds crafted this time.The Action:
This Bond is not the most action packed of the Craig films, but when the action does come up, it is quite satisfying at times. There are at least two battles from this movie that stick in my mind, both getting the blood pumping with the choreography designed. One is an awesome display of Bond's skills vs. The lackeys of the bad guy and the impressive gun toting the license to kill brings with it. My favorite one though, is the second battle of the film, which held a lot of spectacle, plenty of character involvement, and even some comedy twisted into the mix. Bond does not elevate the action too far past the limits of the spy game and keeps it familiar with the physics of the world, which should please many. It's spaced out decently as well to keep things interesting as well, with little interruption in the plot or character development, which is an extra victory for me.The Acting:
The strongest aspect of the movie for me, the acting is fantastically smooth as the shifting into gears Bond seems to have with driving his cars. Craig's portrayal of the spy is amazing as always, with the look, attitude, and bravado needed to take on the world. In this film, the emotional side of him comes out a little more, and much like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, he does a nice job of bringing those emotions out without treading too far into one dimensional portrayal. His performance was believable, he seemed to blend well with all the characters and had a natural chemistry with each person he interacted with. As for Ana De Armas, the knockout look of a Bond girl was amazing on her, and the dress she wore complimented her beauty in a natural way. Yet, the woman has got some incredible moves and the attitude of an agent, with great action sequences that show promise for her in future roles. But her comedy style works very well int his movie, edging into the role very calmly and amplifying a role I wanted to see more of, but thoroughly enjoyed the time I got with her. As for Malek, the man continues to flex his acting muscles and hit the villain role decently well. Malek's approach worked for this Bond villain, an uncomfortable edge that was one part horrifying and one party mastermind to push the events of the movie along. His monologues are executed with theater like quality, and he seems to be living the words that he is testing Bond's mind with and I loved the nonverbal acting he used to support it. Lea Seydoux hit the lead Bond girl role super well, a combination of brains, character moments, and beauty that really painted a wonderful character to share the story with. Everyone else did a great job, but I need to move on to the rest of the reviews.DISLIKES:
A Little More Action:
I won't lie, I would have liked a few more action scenes like what I got in the second fight, with coordination and intensity that had me on the edge of my seat. Sadly, some of the other bouts are short lived fights on wheels that have some impressive stunts, but get a little carbon copy for my tastes for necessary action. Even the last part of the movie needed some extra flair for me, primarily in using other characters in the mission then just Bond alone.More use of Paloma and The Other Agent:
One of the biggest things I wanted was for use of the other characters past talking roles, or at least involving them in more scenes throughout the movie. The thing about No Time To Die, is that several characters felt underutilized for me and had so much to offer. Ana De Armas is one of those characters, whose talents and mystery could have really helped the rest of the movie in pacing, comedy, and maybe a few different aids to assist with finding clues to the mystery. Lashana Lynch as Naomi, was also needed more for me, especially when I got to see the rivalry between James and her. She's got a set of moves of her own as well, and I can't lie and say I would have liked to see her get her hands dirtier as well and show off the gadgets and guns that the agency gave her.A Lot Of Stories Crammed Into One:
As I said earlier, the current Bond's story is a lot thicker than the other tales I've seen in my Bond viewings. I've enjoyed the deeper tale, mystery and connections to him and each chapter has managed to add a fitting piece of the puzzle to help elaborate more to the history of England's finest. However, in this film, a lot of those elements were getting put back in, attempting to answer the lingering questions and push the character development for the agent. I'd say they did a nice job on some of the plot elements, but others felt a little forced in, side paths that offered some clues to the overall mission that made them needed, but not up to the same skills as other elements were. A novelization of this movie might better explore those concepts, but from a strict movie standard, the multitude of ideas feels a little too much to address all avenues to the full extent they needed. I can't say more without spoilers, so I'm moving on to my biggest dislike of the movie... the villains.The Villains:
Rami Malek is so good in his performance and delivered big time on the role of the egotistical villain who was lost in his own views of the world. However, he's also the villain whose direction was not my favorite compared to some of the others we've seen in this branch. Unlike the mysterious man behind the mask approach I thought we were going to get, Safin's role is primarily monologues and that awkward way of phrasing that gets under your skin. Yet unlike villains like Jaws, Goldfinger, or even Mr. White, he does not offer more than that and it makes for a somewhat boring villain give again the potential he held from the beginning. My preference of Bond villains, are those that hold those factors that stand out, or are a true threat to not be crossed lightly or you pay the consequences. Sure there are minions as well, but even these guys feel a bit wasted, simplistic, and forgettable in the long line of Bond henchmen. Fortunately, the story elements merge well with this style of villain to assist with the lackluster antagonists, but given the earlier part of the franchise, I'd expected more for Malek's caliber of acting to raise up.The VERDICT:
Of the five bond films in this actor's repertoire, No Time To Die is probably the middle of the films for this reviewer. It's a good movie for me, filled with some form fitting action, fantastic look and Bond feels, and characters that have a lot more layers than previous incarnations I have seen. Acting wise it is solid and drama wise, it works super well with touching on the story element of her majesty's most lethal weapon. However, this installment still does not quite hit all the boxes of Bond quality that others have, primarily due to how much is trying to be integrated into this final film. Small things like the predictability of the story or limited gadgets/Bond mode guns are a tad limiting, but it primarily has to do with the story and character usage for me in this film. My favorite characters with blended comedy, action, and acting are sort of sidelined, and the villains are not the most impressive compared to the champions of the MI-6 legacy. In addition, the story both works and is a bit busier than I had hoped, almost needing more time to adequately finish those moments they touched on. Still given special effects, pacing, and story, this reviewer encourages a theater watch for No Time To Die and certainly adding to this to the library later down the road.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Thriller: 7.5 - 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",No Time to Die
346,62,rannynm,"Danger, Romance, Sadness, Humor And A Lot Of Action And Violence, But Most Importantly, It Shocks The Audience By Revealing A Secret",10/10,9 October 2021,"No Time to Die certainly kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire two hours and forty three minutes. This movie has a combination of danger, romance, sadness, humor and a lot of action and violence, but most importantly, it shocks the audience by revealing a secret hidden from James Bond.No Time to Die is about agent 007, James Bond (Daniel Craig) who, after a peaceful five years of retirement, comes back to complete a mission, rescuing a Russian scientist who created a powerful weapon out of DNA. During Bond's mission rescuing this scientist, he finds out his number 007 has been assigned to another agent, a woman. He also finds out his wife's secrets and he meets Safin (Rami Malek), a villain who uses the Russian scientist to create dangerous technology. My favorite part is when the female 007, Nomi (Lashana Lynch) tries to compete with Bond on the rescue mission.This film has a lot of dangerous action. The majority of the scenes include explosives that will make the audience jump out of their seats. The stunts are amazing. The wardrobe is very classy and elegant. The female roles are very important in this movie. Bond's wife is Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) who, at a young age had to fire a gun in order to protect herself. Paloma (Ana de Armas) is a Cuban agent who helped Bond with his mission. Nomi is very proud of her number 007 and does not want to give it back to Bond. Watching these women in action is amusing as well.The moral of this film is to trust the ones you love. James Bond didn't trust his wife and he lost five years of his life without her that he can never recover ever again. Be forewarned that this movie has a lot of gory scenes and violence, but it does have a PG-13 rating.I give No Time To Die 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and 18, plus adults.

347,63,Kingslaay,Shocking,6/10,9 October 2021,"I am huge Bond fan so eagerly awaited the release of No Time to Die. The film starts off strong, the second half got a bit bloated and could have been shorter. I like how it wasn't the traditional Spectre vs MI6 but really a new villain who emerged because he was caught in the crossfire many years ago, nicely done. However my main issue here lies in the ending. As Sir Sean Connery once quipped in Goldfinger it was shocking, absolutely shocking.Daniel Craig has been a great Bond and we all knew he didn't want to do another film. We get it. But I feel an unspoken rule was broken when Bond was killed off. A number of people point out that this was a fitting end to Craig's era and it wrapped his films which had continuity. I would correct them by saying Bond in film has almost 60 years of continuity. Bond could have been killed a million times but he wasn't because it is essentially a legacy that is passed on to new generations. Craig is not bigger than Bond, no actor was. It is a great mantle that is passed on. Also Craig had an exceptional film in Skyfall but his other films were luke warm, as received by critics. So why is there a big push to wrap up his run? A bold director could have have reinvented the character again with a new actor. It's been done before.Some have pointed to the evolution of the character, again tied to Craig's films... He went from ruthless to giving his life away. I do appreciate adding complexity and changing things up but the question then is are we even watching a Bond film anymore? Bond has been alluring because of its escapism, intrigue and class for many years. I'm sure the actors and fans can list many elements that make it great. But this feels strange. I think the Director got confused about which series he was making. I am disappointed in Barbara Broccoli as well, I thought she respected the legacy of the franchise. I wonder what Cubby Broccoli would have thought.",No Time to Die
348,64,vengeance20,It's A Tough One,5/10,30 September 2021,"Well... I've just came back from seeing this long awaited Bond Film which should've been released 2 Years Ago, 1 Year Ago if you count the April 2020 release. But yeah, I finally got to see the 25th Bond Film & was both excited but skeptical due to the surrounding... should we say modern elements... which have been plaguing films since the last decade...The film follows Bond, who is forced out of retirement to deal with a villain who is armed with deadly new technology. He also, this time around, has more to lose.I found the film to be good mostly, but with a few things that annoyed me.1. Pacing & RuntimeThe films pacing & runtime were off, I knew prior to watching that the film would be long, but that didn't change the fact I would still object to it & find it a pain given I hate films with poor pacing & an overly long runtime. However, I did think there may be a slight chance that I wouldn't notice the runtime being long due to there being a great deal of action to distract me, but that wasn't the case.There were several scenes which could've been shorten down or left out as they didn't add to the story, felt out of place or just plain dumb & held the film up to the point where you just wanted the film to get to the point & move on. At 2 hours & 37 minutes it's way too long.2. The EndingNo spoilers, but the ending was a downer for me. I mean while action packed, as was the rest of the film, it simply didn't make sense & was a complete slap in the face to Bond Fans & Film Goers alike. It was a disappointment to say the least.The rest of the film however, was pretty good.1. ActionThe action was great Bond was great. The sequences featuring the deaths of villains were good & surprisingly gruesome (not SAW gruesome, but gruesome). The explosions were good as with the fight scenes2. CharactersThe characters were good, main & side characters. Surprisingly, the temporary replacement for Bond (in the film of course) was good too & didn't outwit or smother Bond as much as I thought she would. She was also a lot nicer than what the trailers portrayed. The villain was alright, but nothing special, he didn't exactly do anything for me, however though he did have a sense of creepiness about him which was a plus.3. Eye CandyWhile it's not common, there's plenty of it for us guys watching especially with the side character near the start of the film, she was hot.Overall, it's tough one. I had a feeling it wouldn't be as good as the previous Bonds (especially the Daniel Craig ones), & in a way, didn't expect, in terms of the modern treatments & how I would dislike it. I was right to dislike the pacing & runtime, but surprisingly found the film to be better than what I expected, but the ending I think is the biggest let down I think which goes against what Bond is & what he stands for.5/10.",No Time to Die
349,65,elliotjeory,More style than substance,5/10,19 November 2021,"The film does have its merits, it's smart, stylish and has a big budget which makes for excellent special effects and set pieces.Downside is the story isn't that great, the villain was underwhelming and the Bond girls weren't that great except for Palana who wasn't in it that long unfortunately.Better than quantum of Solace, not as good as Casino Royale and not on par with Skyfall.

353,69,arungeorge13,"Riveting send-off for Craig as 007, in a film that's certainly in his top 3! [+74%]",7/10,12 November 2021,"In what feels like an excellent send-off for Daniel Craig's humanized personification of James Bond, No Time to Die is not just a solid sequel to Spectre (and some of its odd plot arcs) but also an actioner that's incredibly good to look back at. While Casino Royale and Skyfall remain my favorites with Craig's 007, No Time to Die has plenty going for it. It writes Bond as a highly vulnerable human being with everything to lose, adding a sense of urgency and alarm to the proceedings. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga handles the action sequences with ease, with some of the standouts showcasing themselves when you least expect to (like in a foggy forest; or at a bar in Cuba).The love affair between Bond and Madeleine (Seydoux) is given considerable weight here, with a neat little surprise in the last hour(s). The supporting cast also rises to the occasion, with Lashana Lynch, Ben Whishaw, and a stunning Ana de Armas doing what's needed of them. The set-piece featuring the latter is so much fun that I'd go back and watch No Time to Die for that alone. Linus Sandgren comes up with some eye-popping visuals for the 2h 43m flick while Hans Zimmer's score keeps every permeating emotion in check.Now, if I were to ponder over the antagonist played by Rami Malek, that's where I'd have some issues. For what begins as a brilliant prologue - a chilling home invasion scene set during Madeleine's childhood - his re-entry into her life and Bond's feels unsatisfying. His ""grand, world-altering plan"" also sounds too ridiculous for a contemporary series that's had brilliant, attention-grabbing baddies played by Mads Mikkelsen and Javier Bardem, who wouldn't even let us blink. Something's just lacking here, and I can't precisely pinpoint and say this is it!Craig is impressive as ever, and if there's no other reason that should make you want to watch No Time to Die, it very well may be him. His layered, multi-dimensional yet utterly grounded portrayal of Bond has set such a high benchmark for others to follow. No Time to Die is a solid actioner with a neat emotional payoff and, most importantly, a solid Bond film.",No Time to Die
354,70,martimusross,"Tiresome, Tedious & Boring, Such A Disappointment",6/10,1 October 2021,"No Time To DieI would love to say this movie was another Skyfall or Spectre but it just was not, it really was a great disappointment.Overly long at 2 hours and 23 mins, it needed a serious edit, it was saggy and baggy and really quite tedious, it lacked style, panache and humour, I will now detail the problems as I see it:There was a 17 year age gap between James Bond and Madeleine Swann, his love interest, this didn't work.The touchy-feely script was miserable and tedious.The scene with the ""evil genetic scientist"" was repeated no less than three times.The plot was simplistic and yet it was never explained why Safin wanted to eradicate sections of populace.Vast swathes of the movie were shot in a grey blue murky tinge it was awful!I counted three jokes and a few sarcastic asides, when humour is a key element of our hero.James Bond and children does not go and we all know why.Styling and gizmos were present but dumbed down when this is a key element of Bond!The replacement 007 couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, hammy and stiff as a stick!At best this is a weak 6 outta 10, but nearly everyone I spoke to was putting on a brave face without highlighting a single good bit, but I thought the American agent in the black dressed, ""trained for 3 weeks"" was really great.",No Time to Die

I would now add this movie to my favourite Bond films for mainly the same reasons, but also a wow factor. This movie to me has proved that Daniel Craig has been the best Bond by a country mile, Connery is number 2, but not even close. I am deliberately not talking about this film, Just watch it.

357,73,Jeremy_Urquhart,A good Bond film,7/10,14 November 2021,"While not quite reaching the heights of Casino Royale and Skyfall, it was better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre (the few parts of each of those I can remember, at least).At 163 minutes I think it's a bit too long, dragging in a few parts here and there towards the end. But otherwise, the pacing for at least the first two hours is very good.I think this balanced crazy action and the more subdued, serious moments (a staple of Craig's Bond movies) quite well. It's a tone that could have misfired very badly, so the fact you're able to take the story fairly seriously while having fun with the action is impressive.Speaking of the action, it's all very good. Not the greatest you'll ever see, but consistent and entertaining, and the set pieces are spread out well, for the most part.Not a huge fan of the title song, but I'm probably in the minority there (it just feels like an extended intro that builds and builds but ends before the pay off). Villain isn't fantastic either, but Malek does a decent job with what he's given. He's not really a central figure for a large part of the movie, with plenty of conflict driven without his direct (or onscreen) involvement.While it's not perfect, it is largely satisfying, with a decent story and some very good action, and is overall a solid Bond movie for Daniel Craig to go out on.",No Time to Die
358,74,blott2319-1,A fitting farewell to this era of James Bond,9/10,18 October 2021,"As a lifelong James Bond fan it has been a struggle for me to fully accept the films in the Daniel Craig era as true 007 films. The big problem is that these movies break from the traditions of the franchise and seek to create a continuing saga that connects from one film to the next rather than allowing each movie to stand on their own. No Time to Die doubles down on this same idea, and even adds a heaping helping of nostalgic references to the past. I don't know if it has reached a point of Stockholm Syndrome, or it is just the solid film-making that went into this movie, but for some reason I loved it. There are still plenty of places where I found myself questioning the logic of this ongoing timeline, because there didn't used to be a question of ""what is canon?"" in the past, and now I am left to wonder why a picture of Bernard Lee adorns one of the walls of MI-6. Yet these little touches didn't frustrate me enough to sour the film-watching experience.I quite enjoyed the world-hopping adventure in No Time to Die. They did a great job of using all the beautiful locations, and creating a unique look and feel each time the characters were in a new region of the world. Along the way there are also a wonderful series of actors who impact the story, some that were established in prior movies, but let's discuss the ones that were brand new. Rami Malek was strange and off-putting in exactly the way you want a Bond villain to be. David Dencik was a quirky sidekick to the villainous plan, and I found him quite fun. Billy Magnussen had an enjoyable (but brief) role as the douchey new CIA agent working with Felix Leiter. But forget about any of them, because Ana de Armas is so marvelous that her brief appearance almost went beyond scene-stealing to movie-stealing. The only downside to her performance was that it highlighted how underwhelming Lashana Lynch was as Nomi. I wanted to love the alternate 007, but simply did not.The story of No Time to Die is a fitting conclusion for the Daniel Craig era. While this is the least that James Bond has ever acted like the character seen in the first 20 movies in the franchise, it is the culmination of how Daniel Craig has depicted the ultimate secret agent. This is one of the few times I have become emotional while watching a Bond film, and I appreciate any time I'm invested in a story arc enough to form that kind of connection. It's strange because what makes this version of Bond so uncommon is that he is relatable. Typically this is a hero that has been someone the fans admire (or dream of being,) but this movie grounds him enough that we can actually sympathize with his experiences, and I can appreciate that style of story-telling. While I completely understand how other die-hard fans of James Bond will struggle with a number of elements in this film, I was able to appreciate the new depth this gives to a character I love.The film-making in No Time to Die is excellent. I found that Cary Joji Fukunaga managed to find a balance between thrilling action sequences, and slower-paced drama. It all flowed quite nicely as well, so it never felt like they were shoving in a gunfight just to keep the audience from getting bored. I was so engrossed in the story that the long runtime never bothered me, although I wonder if I might notice some lags on rewatch. In true Bond-film tradition, the villain's plan in this movie is convoluted and ridiculous, but it plays quite well particularly in a world still dealing with a pandemic. There were plenty of fun moments that made me feel like cheering, and a decent amount of humor to break the tension when necessary. No Time to Die is currently my second-favorite Bond film from the 21st century. While I could easily come up with a multitude of nitpicks that keep it from being truly great, it did justice to this version of the character, and offered a proper goodbye for Daniel Craig.",No Time to Die
359,75,NijazBaBs,far from perfect,6/10,18 November 2021,"I am mostly amazed by action, technology, and characters. But there is not enough emotions (except typical or annoying ones), lasts too long, unrealistic evasion of death, too negative and desperate, and end is too empty or typical. I expected something more, more love, more meaning, and more meaningful or positive end, in shorter amount of time. Similar to video games like GTA and Battlefield, which is.what makes this movie most interesting.

We're in a rush, to save humanity itself from a toxic threat (Think covid on steroids, plus blood-spurting). But under that threat, we will die in no time at all. Or this is not the time to die. No, it is time to die. For legends as for mortals.A valedictory air hangs over this film, that concludes the Daniel Craig Bond-age. Retired from the Service, our James struggles to secure his new passion against the shadow of the old. Not just his past love-life but - it turns out - the new one's personal past.An early festival celebrates the burning of old memories. We advance by respectfully setting aside those old hauntings. He and his current love both join in. At least, try.Bond's current beauty is one Madeleine Swann - a double-barrelled summons to Proustian recollections of things past.But Madeleine proves suspect when Bond is bombed during his visit to his dead love Vesper's grave. Did Madeleine set him up? Is she the enemy, i.e., the reverse of Pussy Galore, the enemy Bond converted to Us Good by his sexual-cum-moral prowess?Relax, she herself is victim of the evil Specter she has struggled to survive since her own childhood trauma and loss.Not that retirement has softened the old warrior. Bond here is as physically sound (i.e., unbelievable) as ever. For all his advanced gadgetry, his various escapes and exertions show him more of a Wiley Coyote than a warrior. They start with him surviving a direct hit from a bomb - and grow from there. There is much running and jumping and little standing still. And if no man is an island, it will take the obliteration of one to get him.Bond's enemy here is himself a cartoon figure, even in name: Lyutsifer Safin. A double-barrelled allusion himself, he's a warped/misspelled Lucifer Satan. With spellcheck neutralized, what hope Civilization? He makes the resurrected Lecter-like enemy Blofeld seem saintly.Bond enjoys a formal resurrection himself when the currently-designated 007 offers to restore his number. If Bond's wake turns woke with the possibility this black woman might take over the genre, she proves way less effective than the beautiful young white Paloma. Superman may have sired a gay superson but the Bond family business is likelier to pass to a white gal.And guess to whom? As the film opens on the burning of memories, it ends on the start of a story. Madeleine is telling her stoic infant daughter: ""Once upon a time there was a man. His name was Bond. James Bond."" This kid has survived a catastrophe even worse than the one her mother did. She bore up -personfully - herself. When Paloma outshines the 007-temp she may be clearing the way for James Bond's longtime lover's daughter. As Mom admits, the gal has James's eyes. Yathink....?",No Time to Die
362,78,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fitting end to Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond.,9/10,30 October 2021,"Daniel Craig is my James Bond. I was too young for the Pierce Brosnan version of the secret agent, so when a re-do of Casino Royale (2006) came out, I was impressed that this decades-old franchise could take some cues from recent successful action films like The Bourne Identity (2002). Having seen a smattering of other Bond films over the years, the five-movie quintet that ended with No Time to Die (2021) felt bittersweet. Even if there were constant rumors that Daniel Craig was done with the role after Spectre (2015), I'm glad he stuck the landing with this movie.Now, I'm fairly biased when it comes to Bond films. I think Skyfall (2012) is the peak of the franchise. Not only did it cover Bond's backstory, but it also pulled a huge twist right at the end to connect it to every previous Bond film, which had me exclaiming in the theater. With this in mind, I appreciate how the five Daniel Craig Bond films have kept a sense of continuity between themselves and weren't just one-offs with ""Deus ex Machina"" results. What's great about this approach is how perfectly No Time to Die wraps up all the loose ends.I can also appreciate how No Time to Die subverted the standard tropes of Bond films. This ties directly to how all actions in this sub-series of the Bond franchise have consequences. I don't want to get into too many details so as to not spoil anything, but this movie showed that adapting to modern sensibilities would not be the end of the world. After all, a character like James Bond isn't the role model he once was in the misogynistic 1960s.A fitting end to Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond, I give No Time to Die 4.5 stars out of 5.",No Time to Die

364,80,dtucker86,We Have All The Time In The World,10/10,8 October 2021,"When I bought my ticket to see this film the owner of the theatre ""warned"" me that ""This is unlike any other James Bond film that you have ever seen!"" and he was certainly correct. I left the theatre after the two hour and forty five minutes of Daniel Craig's swan song as 007 in a state of near shock. ""I can't believe how it ended!"" I thought to myself. I believe that this really is the end of an almost sixty year franchise the longest in movie history. It really all began in 1953 in Jamaica when a former Naval officer and newspaper publisher named Ian Fleming wrote his first novel at the age of 47 because he was nervous about his upcoming wedding (just think of all we would have missed if he had stayed a bachelor!). Fleming debated about what to name his fictional hero and decided on James Bond because it was the author of a bird watching book! President John F. Kennedy was credited with helping to ignite ""Bond mania"" in the United States when he mentioned he enjoyed Fleming's novels (in fact From Russia With Love was the last movie he watched at the White House before going to Dallas). I don't know where to begin to describe how this is so different from a typical Bond film. First of all, Daniel Craig has aged so badly in the six years since Spectre. You can see the lines of weariness upon his ravaged face. In most of the Bond movies (especially the ones with Roger Moore) our favorite spy runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. However in this one Craig gives a tour de force performance giving the greatest acting job of any who have played Bond. This is the first 007 film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service over fifty years ago where Bond expresses true love for a woman. He shows grief, rage and love especially at the end when he says a special goodbye to. Madeleine before being blown to bits. Yes Bond is dead and there is a touching scene where M, Moneypenny, Tanner and Q drink a solemn toast to their fallen comrade's memory. For the record, I want to mention the quote that M uses about Bond, it is from the great author Jack London. It goes ""The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."" There have been talks about who will take Craig's place as Bond, but there is no doubt that this franchise will never be the same this is truly the end of an era. Rest in peace James Bond.",No Time to Die
365,81,petra_ste,"No Mister Bond, I expect you to end",6/10,13 October 2021,"No Time To Die is visceral, well-crafted... but also overlong and self-indulgent. Craig is solid as usual (and gets more witty lines this time around) but the real star is director Fukunaga: this is one of the best-looking Bond movies ever in terms of atmosphere, shot composition, color palette, and so on.Gorgeous, adorable Ana de Armas continues her journey to super-stardom, here in the (sadly) tiny role of Bond girl Paloma, whose scenes have a sense of fun most of the film is lacking.In fact, I wish Bond had dumped weepy drama queen Madeleine for Paloma. No disrespect to Seydoux, who is fine, but her character exemplifies my pet peeve about Craig's Bond era: every element needs to be overly emotional, with a tragic backstory and a crucial impact on Bond. It seems Craig's Bond can't go to the bathroom without meeting the love of his life or making a life-changing decision. Just give me Connery shooting a bad guy with a pen gun and a cheesy one-liner.And YES, I've read the Fleming novels and I know the first, quip-delivering movie Bond was not an accurate representation either, but this is too far on the other end of the spectrum. It seems Craig's Bond can't have an ""ordinary"" mission and a casual relationship, everything has to come with three spoonfuls of drama. I'm almost thankful this era is over, so that I never have to see Bond soulfully ruminating over Vesper Lynd ever again. James, dude, we all have a crush on Eva Green, but enough is enough.My biggest problem with No Time To Die? It's bloated. My heart sank when, two hours into the movie, I realized we were still in the second act (which has to be the longest and slowest of any Bond film) and there were still 45 minutes to go. No Bond movie should have a running length nearly equal to The Thin Red Line.6/10.",No Time to Die

Bond is living a relaxed life in Jamaica, after having left active service. However, his old CIA ally Felix Leiter(Jeffrey Wright) asks for Bond's help on a new mission to save the world from a malevolent plot.No Time to Die is a mind-blowing film. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga has effortlessly taken over directing duties from previous director Sam Mendes. The ending is a little bit of a letdown but, overall it's a great swan song to Daniel Craig's James Bond era. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The 3D is effective only in a couple of scenes and overall unnecessary. The signature dry humor and puns that are staples of the Bond franchise, are there in plenty. The gorgeous locale are another highlight of the Bond franchise. Daniel Craig is spectacular as James Bond. Craig is one of my all-time favourite Bonds and I'll certainly miss him. Rami Malek's performance as Lyutsifer Safin makes him the best Bond villain, in the entire franchise, in my opinion. Kudos to Malek's chilling and unforgettable portrayal. Lea Seydoux is outstanding as Madeline Swann. Lashana Lynch is amazing as Nomi. Naomie Harris is great as Moneypenny. Ben Whishaw is awesome as Q. Christoph Waltz is great as Blofeld. Ana de Armas is phenomenal as Paloma. Just wish she was given more screen time. Jeffrey Wright is excellent as Felix Leiter. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as M. The supporting cast is fantastic.

368,84,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,A good farewell to Daniel Craig,8/10,11 November 2021,"The film has many of the hallmarks of what we love about Bond films. It has beautiful locations shot in HDR and some of the best action scenes I have seen in recent memory. The story is a little more complex than your typical bond film which I appreciated. Some homages to older bond films such as bringing back the original Aston Martin from Sean Connery films.But the film isn't perfect. In modernizing the Bond character, they have taken away some of Bond's attributes men admired about the secret agent. This isn't the 60s Bond, it's a domesticated Bond. The new female 007 does not inspire or intrigue interest for the next installment of the franchise. So this might signal the end of this beloved franchise.But this film is very entertaining. The first half of the film was absolutely stunning. I would have liked to have seen more Christopher Waltz. I would have preferred they cast someone else for the role of Valdo Obruchev. David Dencik's Russian accent is cringey.Ultimately, I think this film was a good send off for Daniel Craig. He dies a hero saving the world just as every other Bond before him. I just wished they hadn't give him a family to then yank it away from him and him away from his daughter.Yeah, reader, go watch it. It's good. I have no regrets watching it.",No Time to Die
369,85,bob-the-movie-man,Premium Bond with Craig bowing out in emotional style.,10/10,10 October 2021,"Positives:
The script has all the trappings of Bond: exotic locations; great stunts; thrilling action sequences; and more gadgets on show than in recent times. Yet it's a real character piece too, delving far more into Bond's emotions. The story running through it with Madeleine is both deep and emotional: something we haven't seen since the Bond and Tracy romance in OHMSS. (And with Craig's acting, he manages to pull this off far better than George Lazenby ever could!).I found the finale to be magnificent, bold and surprising. We're back to the megalomaniac owning an island lair, à la Dr No. It even has its own submarine pen (a nod to Austin Power's ""Goldmember"" perhaps!?). For me, the production design harks back to the superbly over-the-top Ken Adams creations of the Connery years. There are no sharks with frickin' laser beams... but there could have been. (The set is a rather obvious redressing of the 007 stage at Pinewood, created of course for the tanker scenes in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". It even re-uses of the gantry level control room.)Craig is magnificent in his swan-song performance. There's a scene, during the extended pre-credits sequence, where he's sat in his bullet-ridden Aston just glowering for an extended period. I thought this was Craig's acting at its best. I thought this again in a dramatic showdown scene with Rami Malek. Malek is not given a huge amount to do in the film, But what he does he does wonderfully, particularly in that electrifying scene with Craig.The film has a great deal more female empowerment than any previous Bond, with the tell-tale signs (although this might be a sexist presumption) of Phoebe Waller-Bridge on the script. Newcomer Lashana Lynch acquits herself well as the first female 00-agent, getting not just kick-ass action sequences but also her fair share of quips. But stealing the show is Ana de Armas (reunited with Craig of course from ""Knives Out""). Her scenes in Cuba are brief but memorable, delivering a delicious mixture of action and comedy that makes you think ""cast HER as the next Bond""!The music by Hans Zimmer! It's a glorious soundtrack that pays deference not only to the action style of recent composers, like David Arnold and Thomas Newman, but particularly to the classic scores of John Barry. It actually incorporates not one but two classic themes from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", directly into the film. I'm even starting to warm to the Billie Eilish theme song, although I think it's too similar in style to the Sam Smith offering from ""Spectre"".The cinematography from Linus Sandgren (who did ""La La Land"") is gorgeous: in turns colourful and vibrant for the Italian and Cuban scenes and cool and blue for the tense Norwegian action sequences.Negatives:
My main criticism is not of the film, but of the trailer(s). There are so many of the money shots from the film (particularly from the Matera-based action of the pre-title sequence) included in the trailers that I had an ""OK, move on, seen this"" attitude. Why did they have to spoil the movie so much? IT'S A NEW BOND... OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT. All you EVER needed for this is a 20-second teaser trailer. Just put white ""Bond is Back"" text on a black background and the Craig tunnel shot to the camera. Job done. It really infuriates me. B arbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, PLEASE take note!At 163 minutes it's the longest Bond ever and a bit of a bladder tester. But, having said that, there are no more than a few minutes here and there that I would want to trim. To do more you'd need to cut out whole episodes, and leaving Ana de Armas on the cutting room floor would have been criminal. As the illustrious Mrs Movie Man commented, ""I wish they'd bring in the half time Intermission card like they used to do in the old days"". I agree. Everyone would have been a whole lot more comfortable and less fidgety.Summary Thoughts on ""No Time to Die"": Reading the comments on IMDB for the movie, I'm perplexed at the diatribe coming from supposed 'Bond fans' on this one. One-star review after one-star review (despite, I note, the overall film getting an overall 7.8/10 at the time of writing). In this regard, I class myself as very much a Bond fan. (My first film at the cinema was the release of ""Live and Let Die"" in 1973, but I then binge-watched all the other Bond films at the cinema: they used to do repeated double-features in those days). And I thought this was a fabulous Bond film. Full of drama, action, humour and deep-seated emotion. Couldn't be better for me, and certainly on a par with ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" for me as my favourite Craig outings.As the end of the end credits said - ""James Bond Will Return"".

371,87,tonypeacock-1,We Have All The Time To Get Bond Wrong!,6/10,30 September 2021,"As a Bond aficionado since 1992 I was so disappointed with this film.I have waited six years since the last James Bond film (Spectre (2015)) which in itself was a bit of a let down but was out of the film makers hands in some respects.This film has high production values don't get me wrong but it does get Bond wrong in a few ways that left me quite angry from watching a film for the first time since 2001: A Space Odyssey!Gone are the days of a feel good 126 minute Bond with great action sequences, girls etc. Now we have an overly long film weighing in at 163 minutes. Even the curtain raiser, the pre-credits sequence is overly long. I miss the four minutes or so complete with a breathtaking stunt sequence.Daniel Craig as Bond makes his fifth and final appearance in the role. Whilst his performance is good I cannot resist the thought that he has been let down by a succession of poor scripts that tend to be overly complicated in terms of timelines, family ties and lack of humour.Why can't the filmmakers produce a standalone story every two years that doesn't follow on with storyline strands like a television soap-opera.Hans Zimmer provides the music and he does an admirable job evoking memories of John Barry from On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) the pinnacle of the series thus far?The Daniel Craig Bond films are an arc not seperate entities. They break so many traditions of the 'old films. I still can't get my head around that.It's a dud from me.",No Time to Die
372,88,pietclausen,Franchise is corrupted,5/10,11 November 2021,"This Bond movie has aged too much and has been corrupted by shoot-up video games. It is no longer fun to watch and the finesse has died. It is just another average, watchable film and the candle has burned out. RIP James, but James Bond will return? That remains to be seen! I have seen all the Bond movies ever made, 27 of them, and this one is perhaps the poorest of them all.

Just a collection of cliche scenes, an incomprehensible story line and overall completely boring. The worst of the movie was the new 007 Lashana Lynch, just terrible. It's long, has a very boring song, was a very boring movie, and the ending was TERRIBLE. It is the worst Bond movie ever made, and I've seen Die Another Day and A View to a Kill peeps. This movie is blasphemy..You can't have a woman as 007, keep politics out of our entertainment!!! Tired of it and won't support movies with garbage ""wokeness"". Daniel Craig All he does is resign every 5 minutes cos he's fallen in love, some Bond, pathetic! Anyway this movie is wrong! It's just another woke movie that I have No Time To See.",No Time to Die

More than that, I found it a truly awful movie, in general.",4/10,10 November 2021,"You could remove Rami Malek's character entirely and it would have very little impact on the story. The villian is SO b grade it's actually funny (and they have been for years), And a female 007!! It just dont work. Honestly I thought the movie was boring, but it did feel weird in how it felt like they were trying to really knock down bond and then compare him to the new 007 Female, making her look so much more amazing instead of on par with him. Very weak Bond movie, and horrible ending, shooting scene with Bond and this two girls was one of the most ridicoulus scene I saw, like it was a pastiche of an action movies only it weren't. I hated it. The opening was amazing, afterwards the plot became a bit of a mess. But the point where I got really upset was when they killed Bond. It was not the end of a character arc but just cheap shock value and going against the very character of Bond. It 's a disappointment on the level of Indiana Jones and the crystal skull or Game of Thrones final season. Shame, Shame, Shame!Now I'm going to watch Timothy's bond films to recover from this fiasco! This is the worst kind of movie ever made in the history of so called ""entertainment"".",No Time to Die
375,91,Neptune165,No time to review,4/10,10 November 2021,"I think Ramy Malik was the biggest disappointment in the movie. His whole character motivation and intentions were total nonsense, which was a shame given that the character background was actually pretty interesting. This is a terrible movie. Shouldn't have existed in the first place. The plot and motivations make no sense at all and totally ruin Bond's character arc. 007 deserved a better end than this. This is the worst bond movie. Story was plucked out of nothing. I'm still left thinking what was that. I don't want to say what happened, judge yourself. If you love bond films then your in for a firm slap to the face as this is just bull. The whole cinema was in shock, everyone saying it was Terrible. Daniel Craig just getting a pay check. His last bond and sums him up, the worst. Never getting that time back. Shame. The villain made absolutely no sense. At the end of the day he just wants to. Kill a bunch of people because, reasons? He's not even an anarchist like the Joker, his motivations for revenge only extend to Dr. Swan and to a lesser extent, Spectre. Spoiler warning, but he got his revenge on the latter, so what is the point of everything else? I simply was bored with half of this movie. The Craig franchise should have ended with Spectre.",No Time to Die

Just like previous 3 Bond movies, this one built up from the past stories, and certain characters returned. The plot was fairly straightforward with some messy parts.The action again was on point, even though it was toned down a bit from the previous movies. The best one was in the beginning, where Bond was ambushed.Everyone of the cast played their parts well. Malik's character, who was the main villain, although wasn't just a straight up evil guy, didn't have enough screen time to make him a compelling villain.Then, the opening music by Billie Eilish was pretty solid. What I liked the most was the visuals. They were amazing and hypnotic. One of the visuals was the guns making the double helix shape, and the trails of the gunshot become the bonds between the nitrogenous bases. That was some seriously smart stuff.Probably the best part was the way they ended Bond's saga. There was a character introduced who was related to Bond. This added the surprisingly sweet and also emotional moment to Bond character.Overall, a solid way of ending the Bond saga. Happy 26 Bond movies. 8/10.",No Time to Die
377,0,kosmasp,Not more of the same,8/10,12 November 2021,"The most inclusive movie of the MCU yet - and while I didn't keep count, after the first Captain America movie, this is the first that has an overall serious tone to it. That being said, there is still a lot of humor in it. Especially Kumail and his ... ""sidekick"" cover most of the jokes. Which may be the reason he is AWOL at a certain point in time (you'll know which moment that is) - you can hold that against the movie or just go with the flow.Which is true for the inclusiveness too - and I am not even talking about the very first erotic scene of the MCU. Don't get too excited (or upset), it is quite tame, but might still be reason for kids to be asking some questions (they are just cuddling like we do - could be a possible answer I reckon). You also have the inclusion of a homosexual character - the movie does not make a big deal out of it. There is a tender male on male kiss. Hopefully you are not someone who is offended by such things and open minded.All these things have nothing to do with any ""superhero"" powers (I reckon you can and probably most will call the Eternals superheroes) ... so the movie is quite packed. So much acting talent in front of the camera, so much creative and technical wizardry behind the camera. So there is a point to be made that this could have easily been a Disney Plus show. Who knows, maybe there will be an Eternals inspired Disney Plus show. Could be after the movie plays or in between the arrival of the Eternals and ""Present Day"" (I always wonder what that must look like decades after this was made - anyway). Actually after I wrote this, I read somewhere that they are thinking about making a show and filling in the ""gaps"".There are certain elements that can be considered cliche, but that would be quite the nitpicking, if you went down that road. Chloe Zhao really held her own and was able to reign in everyone and make a really good movie. This will impress you, especially on a big screen (like on an Imax screen). Because it is different in many ways, this may be viewed more favorably in the future with more context or different expectations.We're still early on in Phase 4 and some may have a better understanding or can guess where the MCU might be heading next. I am talking about fans, I am quite certain Kevin Feige and some others do know of course. At least vaguely. 2,5 hours long and never felt boring or too much. If anything it felt like too little. For what it is (ensemble), it is really well made and condensed.Yes there are logic issues (where were they all this time? Why didn't they appear earlier and so forth?) ... they are adressed of course, but would not really withstand a smell test. But if you are invested in the MCU, the question is: do you really mind? Also this can be seen and watched without any knowledge of anything that came before ... but as always it is way better enjoyed if you have seen the things that came before.Interestingly enough characters from the DC (universe) are being mentioned, like Batmans Alfred or even Superman. So there does not seem to be a mean spirited thought behind that. More like an acknowledgment and a nod to the other universe, that has created so many great stories and characters too. And an admission, but also acknowledgment to the audience and their feelings and intelligence. There is not a void - this could be our universe ... maybe a parallel universe that works that way ... wouldn't that be a great thought/thing to have? And who are we to say that it isn't possible? With Spiderman coming up next - the door will be smashed rather than kicked in - and I am really looking forward to that one - hoping to be able to watch it before my social media feed is full of people talking about the movie. I like to know as little as possible - enjoying the movie on a different, more surprising level. Until then, don't forget: there are two bonus scenes (mid and after credit), like with most MCU movies here.",Eternals
378,1,jboothmillard,Eternals,6/10,14 November 2021,"I have never missed an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially with the story continuing in each film, this was the twenty-sixth film in the franchise, Mark Kermode didn't give it the best review, but I was always going to watch it, directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland). Basically, in 5000 BC, a race of immortal beings, the Eternals, were sent by the Celestial Arishem (David Kaye) on their starship, the Domo, to the planet Earth. The ten superpowered heroes are Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Humans' Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Bodyguard's Richard Madden), Kingo (The Big Sick's Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Dunkirk's Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee, aka Ma Dong-seok), and Thena (Angelina Jolie). The Eternals exterminated the invasive monstrous race of near-immortal beings called the Deviants. The last of the Deviants are killed in 1521, but the group have varied opinions over their continued responsibilities and their relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart from each other, awaiting Arishem's return. In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. Sersi was left by her partner Ikaris centuries ago, so she now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman (Game of Thrones' Kit Harington), who works at the Natural History Museum. Sersi, Sprite and Dane are attacked by the Deviant Kro (Bill Skarsgård), until Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. Realising the Deviants have returned, they travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find that she had been killed. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem, who reveals that the mission of the Eternals was not to fight the Deviants but to prepare Earth for the ""Emergence"". Arishem explains that for millions of years, the Celestials, an ancient race of entities, have been planting their seeds on populated planets for new Celestials to be born. The Celestials sent the Deviants o destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of life. However, the Deviants evolved and began to hunt the planets' native populations, so the Eternals were created by the Celestials to cull them. With the reversal of the Blip (Thanos wiping out half of all living things in the universe), Earth has reached the necessary population for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth's destruction. The Eternals have come to love humanity and reassemble, deciding to prevent the Emergence. They reconvene with Kingo, Thena, and Gilgamesh before heading to Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, where they are attacked by Kro and the Deviants. Kro kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. After cremating him, they visit Phastos, who proposes for Druig to put Tiamut to sleep by amplifying his mind-control powers with the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals. Ikaris reveals that Ajak informed him of the Emergence centuries before, he chose to remain loyal to Arishem, and allowed Ajak to be killed by the Deviants six days ago to prevent her from stopping it. Sprite, who has an unrequited love for him, joins Ikaris as he flees. Kingo also leaves the group as he does not wish to face Arishem or fight his teammates. Makkari locates the place of the Emergence at the foot of an active volcano in the Indian Ocean. The Eternals battle Ikaris and Sprite before Kro appears and attacks. Thena kills Kro, and Druig knocks out Sprite after she attempts to kill Sersi. The remaining Eternals work together to subdue Ikaris while Phastos activates the Uni-Mind. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints, but cannot bring himself to kill Sersi, because he still loves her. Sersi uses her matter transmutation abilities to turn Tiamut to marble. Ikaris feeling highly guilty flies into the Sun, while Sersi uses the remaining energy from the Uni-Mind to end Sprite's permanent childlike state and turn into a human. Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to find other Eternals, while Sersi, Phastos, Kingo, and Sprite remain on Earth. Dane reunites with Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, along with Phastos and Kingo, are remotely dragged into space. They are brought before Arishem, who states his displeasure with their treason, but elects to spare humanity if the Eternals' memories prove that humans are worthy of living. Vowing to return for judgment, he disappears into a singularity, taking the trio with him. Meanwhile, Thena, Makkari, and Druig are visited by the Eternal Eros aka Starfox (Harry Styles), brother of Thanos, and his assistant Pip the Troll (Patton Oswalt), who offer their help. Dane is seen opening an old chest inherited from his ancestors that contains the legendary Ebony Blade, an unseen person (voiced by Mahershala Ali) questions if he is ready for it. Also starring Harish Patel as Karun, Haaz Sleiman as Phastos' husband Ben, and Esai Daniel Cross as Phastos' son Jack. The all-star cast, including Chan, Madden, Hayek and Jolie are all reliable, I agree that there is a lot going on, making it hard to keep up in certain moments, but what the film lacks in solid script and character development it makes up for in other aspects. It has good diversity, using many races and cultures, including a deaf character and a same-sex relationship, and it delivers on the witty moments of humour, and of course the spectacular fight and chase sequences, complete with brilliant special effects, adding up to a satisfactory superhero fantasy action. Good!",Eternals
379,2,CinemaSerf,"Yes, you can have too many resources for a film...",6/10,8 November 2021,"The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of ""Deviants"" who are bent on eating us all up. Their ""Prime Directive"", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until ""Sersi"" (Gemma Chan), her pal ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) and her beau ""Dane"" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by ""Ikaris"" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the body of their erstwhile leader ""Ajak"" (Selma Hayek) and must now combine their forces to thwart their ever strengthening enemy and learn why they have resurfaced. Unfortunately, what now follows is a stunning looking, but really pretty dull series of set-piece scenarios that rather clunkily combine mythology and melodrama, romance and action. The camera loves Madden, but as an actor - even clad in blue leather - he is little better than a handsome man. Kumail Nanjiani (""KIngo"") has a soupçon of charisma, but the rest of the cast including the really out of place Angelina Jolie (""Thena"") and Harish Patel (""Karun"") who is intent on videoing everthing at considerable risk to himself, really offer little by way of characterisation and the attempts at humour misfire most of the time. The story has some great effects, but so what? That's what we expect from the most mediocre of productions nowadays. What was needed here were far fewer actors and a much more robust story - and, yes, it could probably have lost the half an hour spent justifying the enormous budget in far-lung locations (real and imaginary). There's a final scene midway through the credits that really does not bode well for the sequel either. I was really pretty bored with this film and though undoubtedly a colourful, action-packed big screen experience, it is an entirely forgettable film to watch.",Eternals
380,3,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's hard to overstate how amazing this is,8/10,5 November 2021,"For 7000 years, 10 aliens have lived among us. Their powers are immense. They are here to protect us from the Deviants, apex predators who we could never defeat on our own. However, their makers, the Celestials, have ordered them not to interfere with our development. After The Snap, something is different, and they may have to go against what they have been told.So, this is a lot to take in. Which is why the movie opens with a text crawl, and a lot of it is characters talking, discussing. I understand why some people feel that this bogs the movie down, that the pacing is lethargic. With that said, I simply cannot agree with them. This is never less than deeply compelling. Chloe Zhao embodies what Roger Ebert(RIP) meant, when he referred to films(as a medium) as ""empathy machines"". It is astonishing that she manages to find humanity(and so much, at that) in all of these super beings, who should be completely impossible to relate to, for any audience member(vampires don't *actually* exist, right?).The MCU is maturing. This is easily the most philosophical, downright existential, entry in the over two dozen series(which, just to be clear, I'm a huge fan of, have been from the very start). Smartly, it is very friendly to newcomers, and you really do not need to have watched any of the others in order to follow this. It makes you think, feel, and stays with you long after the two incredible post credit scenes have played. Honestly, a number of people will be moved to tears by the relationships depicted in this. I came quite close, myself. The diversity in casting, in languages spoken(and signed), all the civilizations and ethnicities shown, underlining that we humans are all one race, our world and problems the same. The sheer fact that this doesn't come across as cheesy and preachy is deeply impressive. This features beautiful cinematography, location shooting and every action scene is emotionally engaging in addition to exciting and cool looking.There is a lot of violence, much of it against creatures, a little moderate to strong language and brief sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone over the age of 13. 8/10.",Eternals
381,4,view_and_review,Eternal was the Runtime,5/10,12 November 2021,"I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute.",Eternals
382,5,neil-476,Epic but unemotional,7/10,6 November 2021,"EternalsSo there are Celestials, God-like beings. Arishem, one of them, allocates a bunch of Eternals (fairly God-like but not quite) to Earth, 7,000 years ago, to protect mankind from Deviants (unexplained monsters). This is their only job: they are not to interfere in human affairs. They wipe the Deviants out and then go their seperate ways, waiting to be recalled to their home planet. Then a Deviant appears...I enjoyed this and the eye candy is splendid, the action is beautifully choreographed. But it is one of the weaker offerings, and here is why.There are too many new characters and you don't get the chance to know them. This means you don't get emotionally invested in them. Yes, you care about whether xyz global crisis happens, but you don't really care about the relationships between the Eternals. A number of character-based subplots are introduced but never really go anywhere. The thing about the MCU is that you got to genuinely care about each character, which is why the deaths in Avengers 3 and 4 were so devastating. That is not the case here.Also, it is longer than it needs to be, to no purpose, and although the story is simple, it is unnecessarily complicated in the telling.Again, I enjoyed it, but it is probably 2nd or 3rd from the bottom of my list. It is competently - skilfully, even - assembled, but it has little heart.",Eternals
383,6,blanbrn,Long drawn out superhero film that spans time and ages!,4/10,13 November 2021,"Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive.

384,7,thesar-2,Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal,4/10,10 November 2021,"This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it's absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best. Since it's barely, like 1%, connected to the other MCU movies, it could be a skip for sure.",Eternals
385,8,FeastMode,i'm so sad,5/10,5 November 2021,"I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening night 11/4/2021, 11/17/2021)",Eternals

The main idea was really bad, plot was very messy and hard to fallow, even The legend of.... was better movie, this one was one of the worst Marvel's movie so far.

387,10,ThomasDrufke,Brilliantly Different Film for the MCU,8/10,5 November 2021,"A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive feat to take on a 10 lead character based film, it's another thing to make you care about every single one of them. Chloe Zhao has already shown us her talent with smaller films, and it's even more telling on a massive MCU scale that she's here to stay. It's hard to say what the best 2021 MCU film is at this point but Eternals has certainly made it's stamp on me. I had a blast.8.8/10.

388,11,cricketbat,Watching this movie felt like an eternity,4/10,8 November 2021,"Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer.

389,12,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,This was the first movie I watched in the cinema after the pandemic,6/10,10 November 2021,"The movie isn't that bad. It's not like other Marvel movies. I really liked the acting, effects and music from the movie. The director's job and the cameraman's job were also great. However, the thing I disliked most about the movie was the script and the story. Eternals was the subject I never knew. It's a movie and it's a comic book movie, I understand, but I don't like the story of the movie.It's not as bad a movie as it is generally said, but it's an average movie.I wish things were better. Also, the movie is a bit long.My rating is 7 / 10.P. S : By the way, this was the first movie I watched in the cinema after the pandemic.

390,13,The-Sarkologist,"Enjoyable, but not one of the Best",6/10,11 November 2021,"The question that is raised now is whether we have reached, and passed, peak Super Hero films. The reason I suggest this is because, well, after the conclusion of Phase 3 in Avengers End Game, it is difficult to see how they can exceed what they have already done. Also, with so many Superhero films being released throughout the year surely people are simply going to start to become sick of them. Like, okay, I'll probably continue to watch them, but when this film was realised, a part of me sort of wasn't really all that keen on going and seeing it, but did so namely because there was nothing else on. Okay, there was Shang-Chi, but the thing is that apparently we'll be watching that with friends.Anyway, the story goes that there is this group of immortals that have arrived on Earth to deal with these monsters known as Deviants that are basically killing off all the humans. For centuries they have lived alongside humanity, and even assisted them in developing, however at one point they simply drift into the background and left humanity work out their own things and will only appear if the deviants return. Mind you, as far as they are aware, all of the deviants have been killed, so they are sort of wondering why they are still around, that is until another, more powerful, deviant turns up. As a result, they decide that it is time to get the gang back together.Much of the film jumps between the present, and the past, where we are learning about the back story of many of the Eternals. We also learn that they have been sent to Earth by a group of powerful beings known as Celestials (who have made appearances previously in the MCU - with Ego the living planet being one in human form). Some people have commented that it feels that it is overtly long, but I didn't really feel that this was the case. I certainly didn't find it boring, though as with a lot of these films, there is a lot that they have to do to set up these new characters. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure how they are supposed to fit in with the Avengers, considering that they aren't supposed to directly interfere with human affairs (the reason why they didn't help with Thanos, which actually doesn't make any real sense when you learn who Thanos actually is).Yes, we do find a few more things out about Thanos in this film, despite the fact that he has been defeated. Then again, this is a cinematic universe, and the movies have been regularly building upon each other, something that certainly hasn't really been done previously. Yet, in the end, it does make me wonder how long they can keep this going, It also seems to be underperforming at the box office, and the critical reception hasn't been all that great either. Then again, I certainly wasn't all that enthusiastic in seeing this film, but in the end it wasn't too bad.One thing that I have noticed, and I do certainly praise Marvel for that, is that while they do have big name actors in their films, many of the leading roles tend to be lesser known talent. This is the case here since, despite Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie appearing in this film, the main characters were played by actors that, well, I haven't really heard off. Mind you, I suspect that Salma Hayek won't be making any further appearances, though I do note that Kit Harrington appeared in a somewhat minor role, but a role, if you happen to dig a little deeper into the Marvel universe, you will discover that he might actually be playing a larger role in the future.",Eternals
391,14,UniqueParticle,Well I loved it,9/10,10 November 2021,"I'm not sure why Eternals got bashed I understood Black Widow hate more. This was so good cinematically especially in IMAX, acting was astonishing, and colors were all glorious! The story might be the only bumpy aspect even that I enjoyed for a Marvel film it's really solid even deserves rewards definitely had a lot of Chloe Zhao vibes that reminded me of Nomadland. I loved Eternals I'd highly recommend despite anything I think it's worth it!Side note:There was a hot mom in the audience that was a bonus though.

392,15,Thanos_Alfie,Different but interesting...,7/10,5 November 2021,"""Eternals"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the start of a new saga of Marvel. The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie since I have watched all the previous Marvel movies. A new era starts with this movie and we all have to be patient about it because time is needed for it to grow. Plenty of information came up and answered some of our questions regarding the Eternals and their purpose. ""Eternals"" surprised me since it was very different from what I expected but it was also interesting so, I am expecting the way that will continue it and what else it's going to present to us. The direction which was made by Chloé Zhao was good and she presented very well the main story behind Eternals but of course there is more information that needs to be presented. The interpretations of Gemma Chan who played as Sersi, Barry Keoghan who played as Druig, Lauren Ridloff who played as Makkari and Richard Madden who played as Icarus were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Eternals"" is a nice movie as a start of a new era but we expect more from it in the future.",Eternals
393,16,cruise01,Beautiful scope and visuals leading Marvel to a new direction.,8/10,6 November 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Eternals is beautifully stunning when it comes to a cinematic superhero film which director Chloe Zhao does well in capturing fantastic settings and scope. The film is way different comparing it to other marvel films. Zhao is aiming high for more of a compelling dramatic tension with the characters and great cinematography shots. And visual effects. The film does struggle with its pacing which can make it feel a little slow.What worked?The plot is great. The story gets bigger in the mcu. Showing Eternals which are immortal beings that have lived for 5000 years. Living among humans. While there agenda is protecting humans from deviants. There is more to the plot which gives it a twist about the Eternals hidden agenda. And a third act twist which a villain rises and divides and fights against the eternals. The idea of a celestial being born and needing to demolish worlds is an epic and thrilling direction.The cast ensemble is huge and all worked great with there characters. Gemma Chan did great as Sersei. Richard Madden is great. Along with Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Kit Harrington. In the movie, the Eternals did a great job working as a team. Every character stood out. Jolie and Ridloff were awesome. Kit Harrington has a small brief role. There is a seed planted for a much bigger part for him in the mcu world.The cinematography, music score, production settings, and visual effects are all great and worth watching. It does feel like watching a big budget artsy film with a superhero theme. The film does have a long epic run time which gives it enough time for it to develop the characters. Lots of flash backs through the centuries. While they try to find each other on Earth. The film spends most of the time with Ikaris and Sersei trying to locate the other Eternals on Earth. So they can preparing for an upcoming doom.The action sequences were good. Chloe Zhao played it too safe and avoided overdoing it which makes the movie feeling a little quieter compared to other mcu movies. A few good action scenes. And a climatic fight trying to slow the villain down to save the world.What did not work?Eternals is slow moving with its pacing. It does have a pacing issue which sets up for an exciting adventure and a epic showdown. It gets slowed down with too many expositions with the characters that the script slows down.Overall, Eternals is epic, it is beautifully shot and done with a great cast ensemble, and a story that is taking mcu to a direction that has yet to be explored. Even with the slow pacing, it is still one enjoyable ride.There are two credit scenes, one mid credit which introduces a new character, and a post credit scene which hints for a characters fate for future movies.",Eternals
394,17,eddie_baggins,A Marvel film that doesn't always feel like one,7/10,7 November 2021,"Oscar winning indie darling Chloé Zhao has had quite the directing career in the span of six years since her debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me first released in 2015, with the Chinese born filmmaker moving onto the critically acclaimed The Rider, the award sweeping Nomadland and now in one of the biggest career trajectory leaps I can recall in recent memory, the newest Marvel franchise starter Eternals.A comic book film that never really feels like a comic book film and one that doesn't pander too the typical Marvel formula that the company and its owners Disney have played too so successfully over the last decade, Eternals allows Zhao too bring her independent nuances to a narrative with a $200 million dollar plus budget, one that is full to the brim with ideas, characters and possibilities, that whilst not always adding up to a completely satisfactory whole, combine to ensure that Marvel's big risk can still be regarded as a success, flaws and all.A fairly well-known property amongst the Marvel comic community, Eternals isn't exactly a name brand entity in the wider film going landscape and Zhao has a lot of ground to cover across her two and half hour plus feature that at times struggles with the weight of various timelines, character movements and narrative devices, to ensure that audiences get up to speed with their Deviants, Celestials and all the ensemble of the Eternal gang but despite the film dragging through certain stretches of its running time and not always giving sufficient time to its cast (Angelina Jolie's troubled Thena and Lauren Ridloff's deaf Makkari springing to mind), Eternals is an often beautifully shot film and one that can be commended for trying to reach for the stars.As she's shown across her short but noteworthy career so far, Zhao is a great director of actors and knows how to explore her characters (often in Terrence Malick like visual storytelling) in ways that inspire thought provoking and heartfelt feelings, with rising star Gemma Chan doing well as the kindhearted Sersi, Richard Madden doing his best work outside of Game of Thrones as Ikaris and Barry Keoghan having a blast as the intriguing mind controller Druig, with all performers working well alongside Zhao to give Eternals something more than pretty visuals and big narrative moments, even if Harish Patel's scene-stealing chauffer Karun may be audiences real MVP.With so much going on and so many characters too juggle along the way, the film plays out in a way that isn't going to be as predictable and stereotypical of what Marvel has built in the years past, with those seeking endless barrages of action scenes and a big city destroying battle finale likely to be left feeling relatively empty by the way Eternals presses forward onto its endgame, changing up the pace in a neat way that while not placing Eternals up too be regarded as one of Marvel's finest moments, at least places it well and truly in the top-tier of their feature catalogue when it comes to offering up something slightly different and far more risky than what has come in the past.It nothing else, Eternals shows that Marvel are not content in allowing their tentpole pictures to become stale and worn out, a good thing for all at days end.Final Say -A big film that doesn't always manage to balance out its many moving parts and ideas, Eternals is nonetheless another entertaining piece of the Marvel puzzle that tries to give audiences something different from a brand that has become synonymous with comfort food blockbusters.3 1/2 Stark family reunions out of 5.",Eternals
395,18,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently.",5/10,3 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) :
Movie Review -Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it.MCU's recent projects have done great without theatrical release and notably, those came after 'Endgame'. 'Black Widow' and fresh fruit 'Shang Chi' earned back box office glory for them. I would have been happy to see them trying something nee after Endgan though. Something like what DC did with 'Joker'. Eternals does not depend on any such backdrop, it's a standalone product and maybe that's it will take some more time to create fan following. In the film, the Eternals, an immortal alien race, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. The screenplay here is not confusing at all but it is terribly slow. Marvel's Filmmaking may take a new turn from here as they have tried something calm this time, unlike super explosive narratives we saw in previous films. However, they couldn't try out something completely different from the trademark they carry which makes this film highly predictable.The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely not flawless but it isn't lame either. Creating a new universe for old fans might have put extra burden and that can be noticed in the film. It has those typical jokes carrying childish humour which you have left behind, 15 years ago. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. It slows down the vehicle anyway, almost to the level when you feel like having a little nap without taking those glasses off.Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. However, the performances aren't that great. Some characters don't even make any sense considering the kind of powers they have. Somewhere, the writing is also responsible for that. Indian fans, please do not melt when you see Indian faces but please laugh when they crack hilarious one-liners. Visually, Eternals is splendid. The IMAX experience makes it truly wonderful and appealing. Marvel's VFX team has provided them a much needed boost here.No doubts, the whole thing is long. Sometimes it feels like, is it gonna take MCU's Phase Five to reach the End? That eternal longing certainly hurts the film but rest assured, it's a standard Marvel Film. Chloé Zhao puts all the elements demanded by Marvel Fans while she deliberately ignores unnecessary dramatic scenes. Was she driving towards daily-soap pulp? I think yes. This is 2021 and you are still using 2011 cliches to add some gags in the film? Seriously? I mean the film is made only for new kids or what? Let the fans decide that. They don't care much about content anyways because if they had, Marvel would have moved on from money-spinners to classic cinema long time ago. Nevertheless, Eternals is a grand visual treat which deserves to be watched only and only in 3D. Yes, Marvel Fans can flock into theatres to scream out for the new superheroes this Diwali while others can skip it for their own good.RATING - 5/10*",Eternals
396,19,southdavid,The Phastos and the Fur-Eros.,6/10,10 November 2021,"It seems now that there's a real desire amongst some to be the first to declare Marvel's unprecedented run of hits as being over. For a while it's seemed like ""Eternals"" was the most likely to fail, given that there wasn't much in built adoration for the characters going in and whilst I'd accept that this is the ""worst"" film in the MCU, that's still pretty far from being an out and out disaster.Since time began, life in the universe has been seeded by the Celestials, a race of incomparably large creatures of unfathomable power. Once life on a planet has begun, it's defended from an ancient enemy, the Deviants, by The Eternals - a group of ageless humanoid aliens, whose powers are used to defend and shape the progress of the native life. After thousands of years hidden amongst us, the Eternals are called back into action when a Deviant, long thought to be defeated, arrives in London.This is, I think, going to be one of my reviews where I say that generally I thought something was OK, but then only list a series of things I didn't like about it. So to try and fill out the positives a bit, I do like the world building of this one and how to points us in the direction of some new characters for the MCU to utilise and where things might go for an Eternals sequel.Issue one is that it's too long, way too long, perhaps even as much as an hour too long. I never felt the running time in ""Endgame"" but I really did here, perhaps that's down to too many repeating story beats, or the plot not moving along fast enough, but either way this is the first time, with a Marvel film, I've felt that it's this length because they felt it ought to be, rather than because it actually needs to be.My second issue is also with the story, there's no audience proxy to get us into what's happening. Kit Harrington's character does it a little bit, but then he's sidelined - from there we're shown in multiple flashbacks about the history of the characters, and what's driven them to the point they are at now but it always feels like . . . Secondhand information, rather than something we're learning for ourselves. The best example I can give of this, without too hefty a spoiler, is that we're told that Sprite has always been in love with another character, but we're not (to my mind) shown any hints of that before we're told. There are also a lot of characters to be introduced to in this film and perhaps because of that some of the Eternals and the deviant leader, Kro, are underwritten.And finally, just whilst I'm on the subject of the Deviants, I didn't like them. I thought the CGI work was subpar and the character designs were uninspired. I think I'd have preferred something more akin to the comics, with an actual actor playing the role. Particularly when the character turns out to have little consequence to the overall story.As I say, generally I though the film was OK, with a second half much improved over the first. I think the future for the Eternals looks much brighter now this first film is out of the way, especially if they can get involved with a more intergalactic story, rather than an Earth based one. I'm sure I'll watch this again at some point, but for now it's just scratching an itch on the way to Spiderman.",Eternals
397,20,subxerogravity,It is a satisfying movie.,7/10,5 November 2021,"I am still waiting for that X-Men movie man.Not too familiar with the Eternals, which is why going into this I was thinking they were like mutants, the same way the Inhumans are like humans. With that said, like the Inhumans, the Eternals cannot beat what Charles Xavier and his misfit crew put together.The Eternals do try too hard to stand-alone. I am looking for a lot of references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I did not get enough for my taste at all. Realistically, this is why I go to the theatre to see these movies.As a standalone, movie it was not half bad. It had a fantasy like story with many cool characters played by good actors. I did like how complex a lot of the characters were. I felt that the Eternals moved away a lot from the superhero genre, nothing in the movie is as cut and dry as most of these Superhero movies are when it comes to the main characters being heroes.Because of this, once again a marvel movie is missing a good villain. They could have used one. As cool, as the characters are they did a lot of talking. Some of the characters like Kingo and Phastos were interesting enough to want to hear their story. I wish this held true for everyone, but it did not. Plus, all the talking made for too many moments where I forgot what the purpose of their mission is.I am impressed with the visuals, especially the Celestials (who keep changing with every movie they appear in, right?). They were impressively big seeing them on the big screen. I do not know if this was Chole Zhao's first rodeo when it comes to special effects but she definitely did not fall intio the same mistakes that the Russo brothers and Ryan Coolger mad on their first marvel movie outing.That is about it, however. It was not enough of a marvel movie to watch it on the big screen like the others with other people as into it as I am (cause no one else seem to be). I'm glad I saw it on the big screen cause the visuals were impressive but we are getting to the point in which I don't know who these marvel superheroes are and its changing my interest (Although in fairness I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy where before seeing the movie and they won me over far better).",Eternals
398,21,kevin_robbins,This is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time,5/10,12 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres its opening weekend. The movie tells the tale of Eternal beings sent to Earth to protect it from entities known as deviants. Once they rid the world of deviants they live relatively normal lives among the humans who are now able to flourish. However, when deviants return to the Earth's surface the Eternals will need to get back together to protect humanity and uncover why they've returned.This movie is directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) and stars Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asian), Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider), Salma Hayek (Dusk till Dawn), Richard Madden (Game of Thrones), Kit Harington (Game of Thrones), Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Brian Tyree Henry (Hotel Artemis), Barry Keoghan (The Green Knight) and Bill Skarsgård (IT).This was an extremely uneven movie. There are so many unique characters, elements and worthwhile conversations and topics. The CGI and action sequences are crisp and well done and the villain(s) are solid. There are also aspects of the storyline that dragged, characters that were painfully ripped off from the DC universe and decision made by key characters that make you slap your head and didn't feel realistic with the wisdom and perspectives of the Eternals.Overall this is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time. This also did not need to be almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long. I would score this a 5/10.",Eternals
399,22,DarkVulcan29,"Not Marvels best, but certainly not the worst.",7/10,7 November 2021,"I heard so many bad reviews about this movie, but didn't watch any of them cause I was worried I be influenced by them, so I decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. I was eager to see a new installment in the marvel universe.What works are the effects, really jump out at you, and never feel over used, and some humorous moments are pretty funny. But what doesn't work is most of the characters don't really click to the point you feel they have a history with each other.. Some of the acting here is very dry, Angelina Jolie gets a mixed bag, some moments in the film she looks bored and sleepwalking, and other moments she's really giving her all. But I am eager to see where the story goes after this.

401,24,stevendbeard,Enjoyable But Not The Greatest,8/10,6 November 2021,"I saw ""Eternals"", starring Gemma Chan-Captain Marvel, Crazy Rich Asians; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv; Kumail Nanjiani-Stuber, Central Intelligence; Angelina Jolie-the Maleficent movies, Wanted and Salma Hayek-Like A Boss, Everly.This is a super hero movie that is based on some comic books created by Jack Kirby. It's been a while since I have read the original books but the premise goes something like this; The Celestials are space gods that are responsible for creating universes. The Eternals are super powered protectors of the Earth-sent by the Celestials-that fight the evil creatures called Deviants. Each Eternal has a different power and they are immortal. Salma/Ajak is their leader and other members include Gemma/Sersi, Richard/Ikaris, Kumail/Kingo and Angelina/Thena. The Eternals and the Deviants had a big battle some 7,000 years ago and the Eternals were victorious. The weary warriors went their separate ways and lived among the humans, gently influencing the humans' progress in technology-remember, being immortal, they don't age. In the present, the Deviants pop up again and the battles are once more joined. There are secrets that are uncovered-mostly about the Eternals real mission-and there is a tease of a future hero. There are 2 scenes at the end; just as the credits start-a relative of Thanos shows up-and after the end credits is the tease of a future hero in the next Eternals movie.It's rated ""PG-13"" for fantasy violence, action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.It's not the greatest super hero movie-they are laying the ground work for future movies-but it was enjoyable. I would buy it on DVD.",Eternals
402,25,alindsay-al,A Good Film that introduces a new side of The MCU,7/10,8 November 2021,"After what feels like forever, Marvel Studios newest characters The Eternals have come to the big screen and I have watched the film today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film documents the story of thousand year old powered individuals and their fight against their sworn enemies The Deviants.Main Character
Gemma Chan plays Sersi and she is the main character here and she is fine. Chan does an effective job in the role and she is just a decent character. She is by no means the best Marvel lead protagonist but considering this is a real ensemble cast she fits in very effectively. Richard Madden plays Ikaris and I thought he was great, it took me time to get on board with his character but he really starts to thrive as the film progresses and you learn more about him and his motivations makes him stand out from the rest of The Eternals.Supporting Characters
Angelina Jolie plays Thena and I thought she was effective here. She is basically the films Wonder Woman and thus has some good action scenes but she has an interesting character that is somewhat developed and obviously Jolie can pull this off well. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are more of the comic relief and they are really good at it and they are just fun additions to the cast. Lauren Ridloff is really good too and she is really important as the first deaf actress to play a superhero and it feels like an important moment here. Barry Keoghan as Druig is a really effective character, he plays it really well and I really liked the twists and turns that were given to his character. Salma Hayek & Kit Harrington are also good in their smaller roles here and I kind of wish we could have spent more time with Harrington in particular.Story
The individual stories for each member of The Eternals are well done, Ikaris, Thena and Druig in particular have really good arcs and make them interesting characters. The whole romance dynamic between Ikaris and Sersi is also really well done too and made it a romance that I actually cared about in The MCU. It has nuance in its storytelling and the motivations of different groups and people is well handled and made me care. But this film has a few too many characters in it and it does slow down the story telling, I also thought the whole ending sequence was a bit lacklustre and fails to deliver completely on the epic levels it should have.Script
The script has some chuckle worthy moments and some complexity too it when it comes to a few of its characters. But it falls short of doing enough to really make you care about the overall situation, it seems so large scale but at times the dialogue is rigid and it digs its heels in, especially in the past scenes.Style
The film looks brilliant. The CGI is breathtaking and the action scenes are fantastically made and flow incredibly well. The film is 2 and a half hours and it didn't feel too long for me and it felt like an appropriate length. But the pacing of the film gets let down due to its editing of the plot, it jumps all over time periods and it feels very choppy which did make the film feel disjointed with its feeling.Overall
Overall, Eternals is a good film. It has a hard job of introducing so many new characters and story elements to an established universe, it has issues but overall I saw this as a pretty positive experience.",Eternals
403,26,masonsaul,Refreshingly different,8/10,7 November 2021,"Eternals has a few problems, it's biggest being a pointless villain, but it's so refreshingly different to the rest of the MCU that it's still a great movie with stunning visuals, impressive emotional heft and humour that rarely undercuts the emotional weight.Gemma Chan gives an incredible lead performance and Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Ma Dong-seok are all also incredible. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff and Barry Keoghan are all great, if a little underutilized.Chloé Zhao's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and definitely one of the most visually stunning films in the MCU. The CG is mostly impressive but has quite a few weak moments. The music by Ramin Djawadi is really good.

404,27,rgkarim,This Film Will Eternally Be Known As The Marvel Diverging Point,7/10,5 November 2021,"LIKES:The Comedy:
For once, the comedy is not the strongest element in a Marvel movie, not forcing too many jokes or elements to offset the direction this film took. However, it does not mean the movie does not have its comedic moments and I enjoyed a few good quips and running jokes that Zhao and her team wrote into the story. Kumail Nanjiani's blunt styles work well in this film at times and when bounced off of other characters sells the joke to much better levels. Brian Tyree Henry's sarcasm is right on point, utilizing emotion and comedic timing to great levels in order to get a good drive out and perhaps a little personality to his character. The winner of comedy though is Harish Patel whose role is simple, but works phenomenally in an Indian Buddy Hackett sort of way that was natural, fun, and relieved the darker moments of the movie. Again, it's not the wettest comedy, but it works.The New Direction at Times:
Eternals is delivering on the promise of being an alternative approach to the superhero film and trying to expand into artistic realms. Using a character focused role, Eternals removes the kid friendly filter to degrees to make a grittier Marvel film (aside from Deadpool and X-men) that starts to bare the mature teeth a little more. The movie is darker, addressing philosophical concepts about life, and converting it into a deeper story past the usual bad vs. Good guys. It works on levels and tries to keep you on your toes for the future of our heroes and this makes for a more intriguing concept than the usual predictable runs. The mature tone means caution in younger audience members, but it succeeds in adding new approaches to diversify the future of the series.The Action, Sometimes:
I won't say the action is the most exciting, but Eternals sort of takes the approach of the Netflix shows, where the realism sets in and the danger is real. This approach leads to more suspense at what the character's limits are, while also offering some more strategic warfare required to execute the Deviants. If you are a fan of seeing this style and dropping the 'theatrics"", then you'll be happy to see the magic toned in a different direction, trying to evolve the battles and the circumstances with it.The Story, to a part:
We know Zhao likes character building pieces and Eternals shows this in the presentation as a character piece over anything else. Mass integration of these personalities came to light and just how many elements each of these character had. Relationships are semi-dynamic amidst the team, and in this one movie explored a bit into many of them at what their approach to their mission was. It's some of these elements that again open the ""originality"" of this film in the universe and allows you to get some time exploring a potential favorite character past the usual splendor.The Cinematography:
While the special effects may be a little limited at times, the actual cinematography is well-done and deserving of applause from this reviewer. Elements from Dune leaked into this movie, with the scale of size differences really standing out. Emotional moments have great angles, the lighting and shading work super well to promote that darker atmosphere. Setting and sequences hold dynamic moments, and all the preparation sort of sells the feelings of the moment as they journey across the Earth searching for the keys to success. I think this may be the strongest element of storytelling to be honest, and seeing all these elements come together really helped set the scenes apart. A nice job on using the elements of NomadLand to this part of the Marvel Universe as it was very impressive for me.The Character Usage:
You know me and my obsession with using the characters to significant amounts for their inclusion in the big moments. Eternals had a lot of pressure for at least 10 characters to portray and for much of the film, they achieved that goal. Each of our gods contributes in meaningful ways for me, playing their part and progressing the story to qualify for being mentioned. Some of them are big on character centric moments and moral challenging questions. Others are the action elements who exist to give awesome fights as the tools to fight the Deviants. Several are comedic relief and the humanizing element of the film, trying to bring the superhero element back down to help with the struggles our cast faces. And others are indeed the combining glue of the movie and, with it, tie everything together in a rather cohesive package.DISLIKES:The Story Incompleteness:
Eternals new direction has promise, but it can't quite get all it wanted done in the 2.5 hours it had. Zhao is big on diving into her characters' stories and though she manages to touch on the elements and deliver enough of the punch needed to get the point across. However, several of these stories don't feel fully fleshed out, elements that are lacking build up and complete layouts at times feels rushed and blunt at times. This continues to occur over the course of the movie, with an ending that really has crammed elements and is deprived of the extra factor I like in my climactic endings. Certainly there are some theatrics, but a lot of things sort of crash together to wrap things up towards the finale.The Deviants:
A major element of this movie is the mystery of the aliens that serve the rivals to the Eternals in this cosmic game of chess. While the design is not bad, the utilization of these creatures and the mystery behind them is kind of blown over and misused on many levels. Really cool concepts get some great starts, but then drop flat, and near the end of the movie are nearly forgotten until BAM you are hit with the elements in a rapid manner. It's not that it wasn't cool at times, in fact it has the coolest move of the movie, but it's shoehorned in and lost to the giant scheme of the movie.The Action Scenes:
While there are some awesome fights to show off the power of teamwork, they also feel a bit shorthanded in the grand scheme of the movie. Many of the early fights are very quick, lasting only about three minutes before petering them out, while others are even shorter and limit the teamwork dynamic I like. Other times, the realism sort of gets in the way of the choreography I love, and I feel the punches were pulled to keep that darker element going to stick the artistic vision Zhao went for. Again, I don't hate the action sequences and find some moments I love, but the level of quality feels inconsistent like much of the movie. Even Thena's climactic fight holds some underwhelming moments, and given how much rode on it, that's not the best finale for me.The Pacing:
The biggest part about the movie that I feel was kind of the weakest element was the pacing in this movie. Eternals is not the slowest movie, but it's inconsistent for me as I watched things unfold. Flashbacks to past and then present are at times fun to see as they try to strategically give you information about how the Eternals got where they were going. However, other times, it just robs the movie of the momentum and could have been used in a different manner to really maximize everything in the film. It bled into the action moments for me, it led to uneven moments mentioned earlier, and I sort of feel resulted in the limited use of the Deviants as described. Zhao's artistic style was indeed a bold move, but I think she needed more time to really execute everything to the perfect level.The VERDICT:
Eternals was a bold direction and opens up for a much broader galaxy and artistic approach to offset the monotony of the Marvel series. Zhao's character centered story approach works for this movie, with all ten characters getting adequate screen time and involvement, as they attempt to take hold in your hearts and memory. It's got layers to the characters, with fantastic exploration of life's philosophy, and mapping out these heroes in manners that feel like a Greek Tragedy. Visual wise, the movie is astonishing in scale and spectrum, helping to really convey emotions and maximize all the disdain of the scenes. And the fact that there is a balance of comedy to not offset this mature direction gets points in my book for following the rules and not getting lost in the popular formula. However, the movie's new approach is not going to be for everyone, especially given how inconsistent it was for me at times and how much it bled into other components. The story has a lot of rushed and crammed elements, not enough to not complete the story, but sort of robbing the film of that full finish she can do. It's ties to the MCU are very limited, and the new path it sets offers the chance for new openings, but is a bit disappointing for those who look for all the connections they can instead of a new pathway to get lost in. For me though, the pacing is the weakest part of the film and it's cascade on the other parts of the movie are the undermining factors. Realistic action sometimes gets bogged down by shoehorned ideas, certain plot elements are lost and then quickly summed up, and the full on exploration of the characters still require more time and perhaps another movie to tell the full story she wanted. Still, not a bad entry into the universe and I will gran this film:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",Eternals
405,28,mhorg2018,Another So-So Entry for Marvel,5/10,5 November 2021,"First, to those who complained about the acting/cast, I guess we weren't watching the same movie, because that's the highlight of this film. Everyone put in a good performance. BUT... as I said, that's the highlight.The story... well, The Eternals, created by Kirby or not, never were a big draw in the marvel universe. So why choose them for a movie? They're really just a sideshow. They never lasted long. At least not as long as this movie felt. The director did a good job, but the pacing was horrible and the movie felt like it was five hours long. Especially the middle where things just go sooooooo sloooow. Another major problem is Kit Harrington is wasted. He's in the movie for maybe ten minutes. And they never really make clear that he is supposed to be/become the Black Knight. This main celestial, if he's so powerful, why can't he just create other celestials rather than drop them on planets that are then destroyed? Are we now going to see the island celestial in every single marvel movie? Or have it mentioned? Nice bit of diversity, but why would an alien being create a deaf Eternal? They don't even have ESP, so that was kind of a drop in logic. So far this year, marvel is 0-4 with me. Eternals, Shang-Chi, Venom, Black Widow. All movies I don't care if I never see again (and in Venom's case, won't see again.) Are they a victim of their own success? I notice from the below 7 rating on IMDB, that not even the Marvel Drones are saving this one.",Eternals
406,29,nancyldraper,Love it or hate it,8/10,5 November 2021,"The reaction to this movie has been a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" outcry. I think the dividing line of responses is whether or not it fits the Marvel mega-action template and if that is okay or not. Just to deal with that question out of the gate, this does not fit the Marvel cookie cutter. There are a variety of differences. It is diverse in both casting and subject matter. The cast is international, multinational and multi-ethnic. We have our first openly gay superhero. We have our first hero who is deaf. We have our first hero to struggles with their mental health. All artfully and beautifully presented, in my opinion. This is not a single character's origin story. It is 10 characters' origin story spanning over 7,000 years, plus the introduction of 3 distinct and new species: Celestials, Eternals and Deviants. It also acknowledges superheroes from other universes, like the potshots at DC's Superman. There are also some Marvel staple components, humour, brilliant CGI, fight scenes and world weaving. This film is also beautiful, in its casting, cinematography, graphics and music. The story is rich and the immense timeline is artfully woven into small bites. There is also a deeper treatment of relationships and some mature but tasteful scenes. The draw for me was Marvel and the stellar cast, especially Gemma Chan, whose career I've been following for a long time, now (do yourself a favour and binge her filmography). I have to confess that when I left the theatre I wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. Then, I heard Rotten Tomatoes gave it the lowest of all ratings for a Marvel movie (49%) and the critics who saw early releases were brutal. But, I also read the positive reviews by ordinary theatre goers and in writing this, I've decided to give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 and, personally, I look forward to seeing it again. {Superhero Action Adventure}",Eternals
407,30,Jeremy_Urquhart,Wish it had been better,6/10,6 November 2021,"I was surprised when all the mixed reviews for Eternals started coming in. It had a good cast, an interesting premise, and of course was directed by Chloe Zhao, so I (and presumably many others) had hopes it could be something really good, and a breath of fresh air in the MCU.Having now seen it, I think the somewhat unenthusiastic critical reception is less because the movie's terrible, but more because it's disappointing. It ends up less than the sum of its parts, because most of the cast is solid, some visuals are really good, Zhao's style does shine through on occasion, and the music is overall quite good. Humour is a mixed bag but a good deal does work.The only thing that's pretty bad is the action- it's either the Eternals fighting big CGI monsters, or magical beings throwing magic at each other. It's just not exciting, especially when that's all you get action-wise, and so many of those scenes are shot in dimly lit, murky environments.Pacing is a mixed bag. The slower rhythm of the film works for a good deal of its runtime, but the last 45-60 minute drags like crazy. And it's not helped by the climax being so boring- I didn't used to have a problem with the frequently criticised ""over the top MCU third act CGI-fest"", but it's been very noticeable in all of Marvel's 2021 theatrical releases so far. They need to start doing a better job at ending their films.Writing wise, it may have helped to have at least some slight introduction to some of the characters in this in an earlier movie, or else had one main character really focused on. Jumping into such a big ensemble and developing them all in just one movie doesn't really work, and neither do the villains either, in the end (what little antagonists we get).As a stand-alone movie, it's not great, but it's worth giving some benefit of the doubt that things introduced here will have satisfying pay-offs down the line. Phase 4 of the MCU needs a direction to go in, or to build to, and Eternals may have given us a hint of that.There are a number of parts of this film that work, and it's only the action and some of the pacing that I'd call actually bad. But it is a disappointment, for sure.",Eternals
408,31,blott2319-1,"The worst of the MCU, but still not that bad",6/10,10 November 2021,"I was far from excited about Eternals because it is delving into an aspect of the Marvel Universe that I never followed nor cared about, and my skepticism was warranted because the movie was indeed strange and decided to build an entire creation myth for the MCU that leads to more questions than it does answers. I was also leery because I was not a fan of Nomadland, and was worried if Chloe Zhao was the right director for this type of movie. That concern also seemed justified as the film (though beautiful) had a number of slow plodding moments, didn't have the greatest acting performances, and got lost in massive exposition dumps that over-explained every single detail of the plot. Perhaps the most frustrating part is that her style of film-making is totally incongruous to the battle sequences that are clearly handled by a different team (and have probably been in development before Zhao was even hired to work on the movie.) This isn't a film vwith a singular vision that has been executed from start to finish, and it just makes me wonder why the decision was made to put a director like Chloe Zhao in the driver's seat based on her past films.Yet, despite the fact that Eternals is easily my least-favorite MCU film to date, I still enjoyed it to some degree. I eventually got invested in the characters, and liked their different arcs throughout the film. What I kept thinking while watching the movie is that even in a lackluster effort, this is still a better Justice League movie than anything DC has managed to make. That comparison isn't just in my mind either, because both Batman and Superman get name-checked in this film, and there are a lot of correlations between the famous members of the Justice League and these Eternals. It's almost like some script-writer was openly thumbing their nose at Zack Snyder and saying ""here's how you really do it."" There were some great moments in the movie, and I liked that they actually took some different paths with this story than you might expect, even addressing a handful of complaints that have been levied against MCU movies in the past. It is still flawed, it is the MCU movie I will rewatch the least, and it is not a direction I want them to pursue in the future. But I wasn't completely mad at Eternals, which is more than I expected when I sat down to watch it.",Eternals

410,33,Anurag-Shetty,"Doesn't deserve the negative reviews & firmly in the middle, among all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.",10/10,5 November 2021,"Eternals is based on the Jack Kirby comic book of the same name. It tells the story of the Eternals who are extremely powerful & immortal entities. The Eternals have lived on Earth for thousands of years & have been present for many of its historic moments.Eternals is a mind-blowing film. Director Chloe Zhao has brought her flair for breathtaking visuals, to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematography by Ben Davis is absolutely gorgeous. What's super impressive is that all the locations in the movie are real & not green/blue screen, which is usually Marvel's modus operandi. The action set pieces are excellent. The visual effects are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The camerawork in some scenes are a bit too dark for my liking. The Deviants are quite unremarkable as villains. Also, there are some minor inconsistencies in the storyline, and there is not too much humor compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, this film doesn't deserve to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first rotten-rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. Zhao has also done a phenomenal job, giving each main role to such a diverse cast. Gemma Chan is spectacular as Sersi. Richard Madden is amazing as Ikaris. Chan & Madden share electrifying chemistry together. Angelina Jolie is outstanding as Thena. Kumail Nanjiani is the star of the show as Kingo. Lia McHugh is awesome as Sprite. Brian Tyree Henry is brilliant as Phastos. Lauren Ridloff is awe-inspiring as Makkari. Barry Keoghan is great as Druig. Don Lee is unforgettable as Gilgamesh. Salma Hayek is impressive as Ajak. Harish Patel & Kit Harington are memorable as Karun & Dane Whitman, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Eternals is a must watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. I promise you won't be disappointed but, expect a one of a kind Marvel film. Can't wait for Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021)!",Eternals
411,34,bankofmarquis,Works well enough,7/10,10 November 2021,"The interesting thing about creating a Cinematic ""Universe"" (like Marvel has done and others are desperately trying to do) is that because it is a ""Universe"" you can tell different types of stories with different types of characters in differing styles.In ETERNALS, Marvel has really attempted to open up their ""Universe"" by introducing their audience to the Eternals, celestial beings that are tangentially interested in the goings-on of the human world.It's not a Super-Hero movie, per se, it's a world of ""Gods and Monsters"" (to steal a phrase) that has repercussions across the Universe.So with this background in mind, the ETERNALS succeeds, mostly, because it is trying to be something...else. NOT a SUPERHERO film, but something on a different plane.Unfortunately, this probably will put off ""Fan-boys"" who want ""more of the same"" (more Avengers, more Thanos, more F/X smashy-smashy, fight-fight) and ETERNALS just isn't intended to be that.Your first clue that this film is trying to be something else is the choice of Director - recent Oscar Winner Chloe Zhao (NOMADLAND), known for her personal stories and interesting visuals. She brings that sensibility to this film and it (mostly), though it is the type of Cinematic style that works best in low-res (like an independent film like Nomadland) rather than large IMAX Comic-book film event films.The movie itself is entertaining...enough. It is, necessarily, slow at the beginning as Zhao needs to set up these characters and the realm that they are playing on (and orient the audience as to how this fits with the AVENGERS:ENDGAME of it all). There are 10 (yes, TEN) Eternals to introduce along with ancillary characters, so the film has to take some time to gather steam.And...it gathers steam, not in the action sequences (which are serviceable) but in the characters and the character interactions and this is where the film really works for me.Gemma Chan (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) and Richard Madden (Rob Stark on GAME OF THRONES) are, basically, the lead characters as their relationship takes center stage for most of the film - and these 2 (especially Chan) holds the screen well, which is tough to do since there are so many characters - and so much other things going on.The real hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, IMHO, is the Casting Director who, time-after-time, plucks relative unknowns and throws them into parts that they are perfectly cast for...Salma Hayak (leader of Eternals, Ajak), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) all fit their parts well, with the relationship between Makkari and Druig being particularly interesting.Speaking of interesting relationships, Ma Dong-seok (so good in the Korean Zombie flick TRAIN TO BUSAN) as Gilgamesh almost steals the screen from MOVIE STAR Angelina Jolie's Thena...almost. Jolie is a MOVIE STAR that just walks onto the screen and commands your attention - and she is perfectly cast as Thena. It is a very smart use of her talents...and her personae as a MOVIE STAR and works very well.Finally, it took awhile for the film to figure out what to do with Kumail Nanjiani's character of Kingo (and Nanjiani's tremendous comedic talents), but, eventually, they do figure it out - but not entirely - which is really the problem with this film. It ALMOST figures out the formula to make this huge, broad, galactic film very personal, but doesn't quite get there.I liked, but didn't LOVE, ETERNALS. I applaud what this film tries to do and I am fine with where it went and was entertained by it. If this is the first part of a journey, then I am anxious to see where ETERNALS goes from here. If this is a ""one-off"" film, then it doesn't, quite, work well enough.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Eternals

414,37,abisio,Some unexpected twists but not enough two and a half hour,6/10,5 November 2021,"Eternals starts with a text explaining the creation of the world and the reason of the Eternals; but the last line says everything changed after the last mission.Then the movie goes to 5000 BC when the seven Eternals arrived, fight some DEVIANT monsters and are introduced. Then moves to present day London where two of them (Sersi and Sprite) interact with humans; but DEVIANTS (who should have been extinct) appears; so they have to fight again.Considering danger is coming back decided reunite the group again. That was pretty much what the trailer showed and takes the first half of the movie giving some screen time to each other character, a real love story and a few suggested. This first half is slow paced and low on action. Some small fights and twists are not enough to keep interest.Suddenly a reveal occurs (not totally unexpected considering the last line of text in the introduction) but turns the movie in something more interesting.Another reveal by the third act turns the story darker (not on the DC COMICS level) but betrayals are resolved too fast predictable; as it is the final fight.The acting do not help at all; Richard Madden has three facial expressions and one of them is when rays come out his eyes. Gemma Chan does not show personality to become the leader and her final showdown is too simple.Salma Hayek is Ok as a motherly leader, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Kit Haringtong are always fun to watch but their screen time is short compared with the first two.Barry Keoghan is the most interesting character and personality here. I saw him in other movies and is an interesting, very deep actor.Angelina Jolie is a surprise. She barely speaks in the first half and her character has little screen time. She is always good but is secondary or even tertiary character here.Last but not least; the script has a lot of holes. Some parts like the DEVIANTs reason to exist does not hold any logic.I have the feeling some things were changed on the editing room. There are trailer scenes that has been changed or eliminated.In any case, by the end there are some spectacular images and few comic moments thanks to Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry.It is not easy to give enough time to seven characters; but some better effort could have been done and took time out of the love story. Is my opinion.In brief; is long not lots of action and a mix of interesting ideas and failed ones. It is your decussation.",Eternals
415,38,Sir_AmirSyarif,Magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters,6/10,14 November 2021,"Chloé Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters.

416,39,kjproulx,"A Imperfect, Solid MCU Film",7/10,5 November 2021,"After over a decade of movies and the beginning of television wiggling its way into this universe as well, The Marvel Cinematic Universe is simply one of the most impressive franchises of all time. That's not to say it's the best franchise of all time, just incredibly ambitious without stumbling very often. Eternals is the first film in a very long time, to be this ambitious in introducing this many characters at once. Yes, this is a downside to the film overall, but I really enjoyed watching it. From the terrific direction to the beautiful look and feel, here's why I think Eternals is worth your time, even if you might be someone who won't like it as much as I did.To put it as simply as possible, there are beings known as Celestials. The Celestials are responsible for the creation of all living things in the Universe. Using these powers thousands of years ago, they created a small race known as Eternals. They were placed in our Universe to oversee human existence and only interfere with any conflicts if creatures known as Deviants ever were to arise. Thousands of years later, in the present day, something has awoken them. Needing to get the band back together, this film is purely about the reassemblance of the Eternals in order to stop this looming threat.That description may seem like it makes for a super exciting time at the movies, but please don't go into the film expecting non-stop action like Avengers: Infinity War. This is a film that takes its time, flashing back and forth, teaching you the backstory of these characters so that you care about the consequences moving forward. Chloe Zhao's direction here is very much her style and it's very apparent that she was given the freedom of bringing her tone to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The strongest point of this film is the fact that everyone is likeable. Everyone is given just enough time to make an impact, even though I think more time with each of these characters would've helped it a lot more.Leading up to The Avengers back in 2012, we had films that developed each of the core characters first. This is a film that was trying to bring a team together with far less time and far more characters to boot. It's nearly three hours long, but there are times when it honestly feels like a couple more hours could've helped it. I'm starting to think this story would've worked much better as a Disney+ series that's still connected to this world, but I understand that the ideas presented here were necessary to be seen by a larger audience. This was a huge problem I had with the film, but that aside, I still really liked it.My issue with the characters would've been a lot greater, however, if it wasn't for all of the performers making me care about them. Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan were probably the biggest standouts to me, all providing a bit more depth than the rest of the cast, but everyone brought their A-Game here and it showed on-screen. On top of the great cast, there are spectacular visuals that are unlike those from other Marvel films. Yes, the CGI creatures and things of that nature are all still present here, but the CGI backgrounds and landscapes all felt very real this time. I really enjoyed the attention to detail when it came to that.In the end, Eternals both feels like a traditional Marvel Cinematic Universe film while also doing things that this franchise hasn't done before. The drab tone, slow pacing, and overall ""Epic"" feel (especially with its runtime) all worked incredibly well for me. I just wish this story had more time to breathe, even with being nearly three hours. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a necessary watch, given the ramifications, this will likely have on the franchise as a whole. As big as this movie feels, I think it only scratched the surface. It's far from perfect, but even with its flaws, this movie really worked for me. Eternals is now playing in theatres and I think it's worth seeing.",Eternals
417,40,Carycomic,"Better than the ""Venom"" sequel. But, not as riveting as ""Black Widow.""",5/10,7 November 2021,"I remember buying ETERNALS volume 1/number 1 when the Jack Kirby comic first came out. And I considered it revolutionary. A Marvel Earth where the superheros and super-villains were based on ancient astronaut theory!I was, therefore, sad when the series was cancelled. Although, I was heavily consoled when the dangling plot threads were resolved by THOR v. 1/#300.As for Neil Gaiman's ""Celestial Seed' story arc? That I found considerably less-than-impressive. So, Marvel Films adapting that element into the screenplay of this movie was just as disappointing. Especially with the total revision of the original premise, re: Ikaris being the heroic protagonist and Druig being the traitor!Add all that to the fact that there was one part, early on, that I literally slept through and you have a next-phase Marvel flick that might be useful in introducing the Black Knight to modern cinematic continuity.

There are some messy moments and plot points that don't quiet work... but I really liked this movie.I like that it takes its time to build up the characters and their relationship with each other. I love the more serious tone and and themes. I love how it's shot. For Marvel's lowest rated movie, I though it had a lot more good than bad in it.I surprisingly liked the characters a lot. I've seen some complain that there's too many of them, but I though it did a great job at balancing all of them. They were all memorable in their own way.I just don't see why THIS is the movie that made critic so disappointed. It's really not bad at all.

419,42,MrDHWong,"The boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far",7/10,4 November 2021,"""Eternals"" is the third film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), it is the boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far.For over 7,000 years, the immortal aliens known as the ""Eternals"" have lived secretly among the human race in various places on Earth, watching as they have advanced throughout the course of history. A short time after half of all life was restored during the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", the Eternals each discover that an apocalyptic event known as the ""Emergence"" has begun, causing their ancient foes ""The Deviants"" to reawaken and attack the human population. With the very existence of humanity resting on their shoulders, the Eternals must now collectively reunite to prevent the destruction of everything they have all witnessed come into being.Considering how many years it's been around, the MCU hasn't pushed too many boundaries with the formula it has created. Almost all of them follow a typical template - introduce the hero, establish their significance, have them acquire their powers, make them fight and defeat the villain(s), and tease at their inclusion in future movies. Rinse and repeat. You could argue that there's no point in fixing what isn't broken but at the same time I've always wanted to see them try something new to shake things up a bit. ""Eternals"" happens to take a number of risks with its approach to origin stories and while not all of them succeeded, the ones that did show that there is hope this long running series won't stagnate creatively anytime soon.Rather than the usual everyman or everywoman who gain their superpowers later on, here the titular Eternals are actually omnipotent figures that have always had access to their godlike abilities. As a result, the film doesn't spend any time showing how they all reached their full potential, instead expecting us to accept their unique qualities right away. But this doesn't mean the characters aren't relatable at all, as they still experience the same type of problems as regular humans. In spite of their status as ageless beings, each of them display modern humanlike traits from time to time.For example, the character Sersi has an addiction to her smartphone, enamoured by the convenience of being able to take photos instantly. This is a believable attribute that an individual who looks as youthful as her would have in today's world, which adds some necessary depth to someone who has been alive for thousands of years. Little quirks like this remind the audience that it is possible to feel a connection to these characters without feeling too alienated by their otherworldly origins, and moments like that help distinguish the MCU from the early films of the DC Extended Universe.Coming hot of the tails of winning the Best Director Oscar for ""Nomadland"", Chloe Zhao here delivers a film that could be considered the complete opposite. Whereas ""Nomadland"" was a humble down-to-earth story about people surviving with what they had out on the road, ""Eternals"" instead takes the audience on a different type of journey - an effects-laden exploration of the mythology of heroes. Zhao likens each of the Eternals' interactions with humans to that of the ancient Greek and Roman gods with the impact they've left on mankind's progress throughout history, both positive and negative. Such examples include inventing ploughshares for farmers and later the atomic bomb to bring about the end of a major war. While I do appreciate this vastly different approach to what we're normally used to, the major problem here is that the film focuses too much on fleshing out each member of the Eternals.Since the film has an ensemble cast of more than ten lead characters instead of just one, most of the resulting runtime is unfortunately stuffed with bloated exposition about their overall relevance to the story. I understand the importance of developing each of the characters' individual personalities, but so much time is spent doing this that it causes the second act to drag on way longer than it should. Anyone who is expecting frequent action throughout will be disappointed as most of the best parts occur near the conclusion. Granted, there is a decent amount of emotional weight during this climactic finale, so it was partially worth sitting through the whole thing in the end.Out of all the Eternals, the only one that comes close to being the main protagonist would be Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has the ability to shapeshift any type of matter around her. She is easily the most likeable of the main cast, as she is the emotional glue that holds them all together. As for the rest, I also liked Richard Madden as Ikaris, who can fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, a Bollywood star who can fire energy beams out of his hands. To comment on every other member of the Eternals would take too much time so these three are the only ones I am going to single out here. Although his role is only a minor one, Kit Harrington's character Dane Whitman was amusing as the absent-minded boyfriend of Sersi. It's interesting to see two significant ""Game of Thrones"" actors like Madden and Harrington in the same film together, added by the fact that they each know someone homophonically named Sersi/Cersei.Though ""Eternals"" didn't achieve everything it was setting out to accomplish, it was still bold enough to deviate from the monotonous formula it has had set in stone over the past thirteen years. Naturally there will be many people who will hate this film for doing just that, and that is completely understandable, but personally I admire that it took risks instead of playing it safe as per usual. I don't think every other MCU film should follow suit as this may result in alienating too many hardcore fans, but hopefully this one will leave just enough of an impression to show that the series is capable of trying new things.I rate it 7/10.",Eternals
420,43,CANpatbuck3664,The Obvious Joke: Marvel Studios Presents The Mehternals,6/10,7 November 2021,"Eternals has the unenviable task of not only helping reboot the Marvel universe but introducing an entirely new team of characters. Its tougher to do than you think and I would describe the execution as mixed. I did like most of the characters they offered up, they have mixed power sets and perspectives on the Celestials. Each of them are distinct and relatively fun to watch. It's one of the pleasures of a team movie, you get to ride along as they build comraderie and group chemistry. We get some time to spend with each of them and other than Athena and Gilgamesh's dynamic, none of it is particularly involving or compelling. It was a tall task and while Eternals didn't faceplant on developing the characters, it didn't stick the landing either.I was a little surprised about how big of a cast this project was able to put together. But Marvel has the money to write big cheques with many zeroes so that may have played a factor as well. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are the two actors with the most screen time and while they are both capable and charismatic performers, they're handcuffed by their characters. They're both a little wooden, I want to believe that they were directed to be that way to sell the unfeeling and godly nature of their characters but it made it more difficult to empathize with their struggle. I felt bad for Angelina Jolie, she showed up to work and she does a great job. Her character is also the most interesting on the team. But the movie has her alternate between fighting and freaking out and there's little room to show her range in between. Kumail Nanjiani provides the movie with some much needed levity but a lot of his material feels like retreads of Tony Stark's snarky one-liners and I just didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I also want to credit Brian Tyree Henry (his scene in 1945 is easily the most emotionally impactful in the movie), Ma Dong-Seok and Lia McHugh for their work in their supporting parts. I thought Salma Hayek and Barry Keoghan were interesting casting choices and they both play well against type.If you're going to check this out on the big screen, you're going to want some big action set pieces. Eternals doesn't reinvent the wheel but I did like a lot of the fight scenes. The different powers the group possesses are utilized well and while the Deviants are pretty generic, I did like how they adapted to the Eternals and became more difficult to fight as the movie went on. So from that angle, Eternals scratches that itch.There are plenty of things to praise in Eternals but there are just as many weaknesses. They put too much on this movie, there's so much setup and between the odd editing for the flashbacks and jumping back and forth between locations and different periods of time, Eternals feels unfocused. It's also just too long, you feel the 2.5 hr runtime and with how slack the pacing can get, I was definitely shifting around in my seat and checking my phone.I feel bad for Chloe Zhao and the Eternals creative team. Eternals is a passable superhero flick, the action scenes are solid, the cast is game and the effects look good. Everything should add up to a success here. But the movie is bloated, too exposition heavy and despite a diverse cast of characters, you can't really bond with them over their struggle. It just feels too derivative for Marvel and while that's understandable considering their longevity and the weight of the expectations, it doesn't make Eternals any better. I saw this with a couple of friends and one of them compared it to Green Lantern. I think its better than that effort but its fairly good match. Skip Eternals in the theatre but if you're a ride or die Marvel fan, check it out on Disney Plus.",Eternals
421,44,lareval,Sadly disappointing,4/10,7 November 2021,"The problem here is not the gender nor the personality or the orientation of the characters. I'm perfectly fine with that. The problem is watching a movie with so many storylines, background and flashbacks that finally succumbs to its own ambition. Another problem is having plenty of characters, all of them unknown (because if we at least know two or three of them it would be an extraordinary help) and not knowing even what to do with all of them properly. And one more problem is a pacing that doesn't help, and I'm someone who watched a lot of slow burners. Such a shame, because I wanted to like this and prove all their haters were wrong. Not the worst MCU movie to me, but -yeah- one of the worst.

422,45,johannes2000-1,"Visually spectaculair, but too much talking.",6/10,15 November 2021,"I wasn't familiair with the Eternals, so I have to judge this movie on its own merits. As to that, I'm a bit ambiguous. Yes, the movie looks awesome, the CGI is amazing, and the action sequences are thrilling. But what I dearly missed was the feeling of being drawn into the narrative, of being involved with the characters and their stories, of real urgency for all the goings on.What did not help was the extremely complicated main story, and also the fact that there were just too many characters to have to relate to, which was pretty hard, even in two and a half hours, so as a result their backgrounds mostly stayed vague or even unfathomable. What didn't help either were those long stretches of endless talking, it brought the movie time and again to an almost standstill.Some of the actors seemed strangely misplaced as intended god-like super-hero (Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff, Kumail Nanjiani), others were hardly convincing (like Angelina Jolie) or didn't even seem to try (like Richard Madden, who apparently thought that his character constantly had to look and act grim and stone-faced!). My real favorites by the way were Gemma Chan as Sersi and Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh.I understood from the ending, that there are many eventful things to come in the next sequel(s), so maybe I have to consider this first movie more as a preliminary introduction. But if by introduction you think of getting gradually enlightened in the main story, it failed.",Eternals

The style and plot of the movie is different; it's a lot more mature and emotionally driven, focusing on the characters and the role of humanity on the planet, but still has a few lighter moments and it never felt long. Great acting from the varied cast, especially Chan as the lead, but I'm not sure how it will stand out as being memorable in the years to come.

This is an interesting film, that opens up a bunch of new storylines for future films.. but the film itself... I feel like it was a bit of a misfire.. which is very rare for Marvel... the film contains a lot of world building stuff to set up the Eternals storyline which requires an awful lot of flashbacks and back story... which hampers the forward momentum of the main story... The cast is decent, Gemma Chan does most of the heavy lifting.. but they really waste Angelina Jolie and especially Salma Hayek in the film. It gets better in the last act but sadly this might be the weakest Marvel film since the MCU started.

The characters were uninteresting and hard to vouch for, and the best character was a fat Indian side kick. The effects look good, as does the cinematography, but that's a standard for Marvel filmmaking, it's the execution and momentum of the vision that fails.

427,50,dfle3,Eternals: diverse cast and characters rewrite human history. 77.5%,8/10,10 November 2021,"This new entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the origin story of a group of extraterrestrials known as ""Eternals"", who have been on Earth for millennia, sent here to protect humans from a deadly threat known as ""Deviants"", which are beasts that prey on them. Then things get complicated. If you've been watching the MCU entries and wondering why you haven't seen or heard of them before, well, the film does explain that, which you may find more or less plausible. Or not. The Eternals look like humans but they just have superhero kinds of powers. And they never age, which kind of makes sense, given that they're called...The breadth of this film is epic, covering the dawn of human civilisation to the present day, I suppose you'd call it or, at least, after ""The Blip"", which occurred in ""Avengers: Infinity war"". That being said, as an origin story, there is no need to be familiar with previous MCU films in order to feel confident watching this one, as it's a stand-alone outing.An interesting aspect to this film is how it offers an alternative myth to the rise of humans as well as implying that myths and legends which exist in our actual history are wrong. The names of the Eternals play on this notion, with characters called Ikarus (played by Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) to name but a few. Given how American Christians have protested against 'Satanic' heavy metal music or even Harry Potter, for goodness sake, I'm surprised that they haven't protested against this film for challenging biblical accounts of the nature of the universe!Now, seeing how these Eternals are depicted as advancing human civilisation over millennia, I suppose that could make one roll one's eyes in disappointment. Maybe I did this initially but I just submitted to the myth and went along for the ride. At the back of my mind, however, was the thought that this depiction patronised humans. If Marvel's counter-myth, which short-changes the ingenuity of humans offends, well, at least be calmed by the knowledge that the works of William Shakespeare aren't attributed to any of the Eternals!I can't say that seeing this film was something that I was keen to do but I did come across some information somewhere that it was (or would be) directed by Academy Award winning director Chloé Zhao, a woman who grew up in China (she is the first Asian woman to win an Academy Award for direction). Even though I hadn't seen any of her previous films, that titbit was enough of a lure for me to see the film, out of curiosity at least. It was a punt which I'm glad I took, in contrast to a similar scenario, which was also in the MCU, where another Academy Award winning director Ang Lee (a man who was born in Taiwan) directed ""Hulk"". That Lee film was quite a disappointment to me (I'd say that I saw that before I began reviewing films on the original ""The movie show"" website and then moved to this site when SBS closed their website). It was conceivable to me that I would also find Zhao's film pretentious and underwhelming but she's done a solid job here. Seeing a trailer for this film recently, it didn't look promising on the comedy front at least, with that scene where an Eternal breaks a table. It looked like humour aimed at very small children. However, I can say that I did laugh other times, so the humour improved (I especially liked the inside humour about online video creators).If you've seen the two most recent ""Avengers"" films and the opinions of supervillain Thanos gave you pause for thought, well, you might like the direction that ""Eternals"" goes into, as it takes this to a whole 'nother level, perhaps, with the character of Arishem.Anyway, I enjoyed this film but I don't think that I'd make a point of seeing it again and I might not be interested in seeing any sequels (unless, maybe, Zhao also directs it and...the Avengers aren't in it, perhaps). This MCU outing had a diverse cast and diverse characters. A minor gripe for me though was finding it hard to understand dialogue on some occasions, either because of accents or the use of audio effects, like that used for the voice of Arishem.The following are just random observations for my own benefit:* Is it weird that Eternals are extraterrestrial in origin yet are otherwise like humans? I mean, I assume that humans can interbreed with them!* Is it weird that the extraterrestrial Eternals have sex in the missionary position?* Is it weird that these supreme Eternal beings include the deaf amongst their ranks?* One Eternal, ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) reminded me of a similar character in ""Interview with the vampire"" (I think...my memory could be faulty here). Why is there such a young Eternal? What's that all about?* I was also wondering about the point of the Deviants but if I imagined them to be the inspiration for the concept of ""demons"", they didn't bother me so much.* One of Ikarus' superpowers reminded me of Superman...this is referenced later on in the film.* One part which I found to be unbelievable was where early humans take up arms against obviously much more powerful Eternals...which have just helped them. That didn't ring true to me...for those two reasons.* Product placement and endorsement by Eternals was quite marked. I counted two such scenes. How about you?* One scene was presented as being in Australia...I had my doubts about this, for some reason.* Climate change is brought up in the narrative.* Lastly, I found the Eternals' frequent ruminations on what makes humans worth saving insipid.* Lastly, lastly, my scoring for this film was tracking at 75% (7 out of 10 stars here), then 75+% (8 out 10 stars) then my final score of 77.5%.",Eternals
428,51,ethanbresnett,"A slightly new flavour for Marvel, and a very tasty flavour indeed",8/10,6 November 2021,"If I were to use one word to sum up Eternals it would be beautiful. Beautiful story, characters, score, visuals, themes. Everything in this film just felt like such a treat.What I loved most was how much there was to discover and learn. Eternals lifts the lid on a whole new world within the MCU and it was just a joy to get to know these new characters, who were all very different and exciting. I was concerned that introducing 10 characters would be a handful, but it was masterfully done. All of them felt well explored and developed and there were no weak links.As you'd expect from such a solid cast list the performances were great. Highlights were Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Angelina Jolie, all of whom were so captivating, but really all of the cast nailed it.I thought the plot was very interesting. A few unexpected twists and turns, moral quandaries, compelling themes, exciting if a little repetitive at times action. A bit of a deviance from the usual MCU formula but a most welcome one indeed.As mentioned the visuals were stunning. Zhao's direction can't be faulted and was complimented perfectly by the epic score provided by Ramin Djawadi.As a final point, because I've seen other reviewers accuse the film of being slow, the pacing was absolutely spot on. It flowed so well, took its time but was never meandering or lost. For a film that is over two hours thirty it absolutely flew by.I got everything I wanted and more from this film. It was a visual feast and an engaging and compelling story with complex characters. Arguably a bit of a risk for the MCU but it has massively paid off.",Eternals
429,52,akshatmahajan,Very loose script,5/10,5 November 2021,"I was really excited for this movie and went to see this with good expectations but nothing went as expected.Script was loose and screenplay was very shattered. There were problems with editing also. Direction also felt weak, didn't seem like it was directed by Oscar winner director.Story was weak and childish and it looked like if too much was added in the movie. This could have been easily two part movie.Overall, this movie was an unexpected disappointment. Hope, they improve in sequels.

432,55,fciocca,Underdeveloped plot and flat characters. Great CGI.,5/10,15 November 2021,"From the director of ""Nomadland"" which I truly enjoyed, I was expecting way more. Chloé Zhao won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture and she is good at telling some kind of stories, but her lack of experience with superhero movies is noticeable. This film is painfully slow and definitely too long, because some storylines take too much screen time. There were basically 7000 years of plot to cover, but the screenplay focuses on some useless story lines, that do not have any kind of impact on the plot. It needs to be heavily cut down. Another thing that I found really annoying is that the movie tells multiple times that ""Eternals"" is part of the MCU, like the audience is composed of a bunch of kids that cannot connect the dots. Disney has been building this narrative universe for more than 10 years. People got the fact that every movie or TV show that Marvel Studios releases is part of it, no need to reiterate. There was a lot of potential, but they did not explore these characters enough and by the end of it, I feel like I barely knew them, so I was not attached to any of them. The acting felt really flat, despite having some class A actors such as Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. They were not at all convincing. I wonder who decided to hire Gemma Chang, because she portrays one of the most important characters, but she is the most unimpressive element of the cast.I liked how they developed the Celestials and Arishem. I see a lot of potential in this storyline and I hope that they will write an interesting plot for them. CGI is well done and fight scenes are a little bit different than the average Marvel movie, with tons of creative effects. Overall it looks good and also way better than the recently released ""Black Widow"". I think that the Deviant design was captivating and I enjoyed their evolution from primal creatures to sentient beings. It gave them a lot of depth and I wish that the movies could focus on this aspect more. There is a little bit of cheesy comedy, but I have to say I have really appreciated the DC references, and found it genuinely funny.If you are a Marvel fan and you are following the MCU, I guess that you need to watch this movie, in order to fully understand the future entries of the franchise, otherwise it is avoidable. If you have a Disney+ subscription, just wait for the release on the streaming service, no need to waste money going to the theatre, like I did. Underdeveloped plot and flat characters. Great CGI.",Eternals

This is hypocrisy.Personally I liked it. I will any day choose this over Black Widow. All the MCU haters are just giving it negative reviews without even seeing the movie, because they know they don't get this opportunity too often.

The acting was good but the actors where underused especially Jolie that's what you get when you have to much characters. The story dragged on and on especially the flash back scenes they could of cut them out completely. The story it self was also just meh and the villain was meh. The movie was just meh.

435,58,aarongnr,"I don't understand how this movie is ""dense""",8/10,4 November 2021,"So many critics and reviewers here said this movie is ""dense"" or there is alot to ""unpack"". I don't get it. The story is very straightforward, little to no exposition.Most of the movie is about the drama between the characters and them finding out more about the ""Emergence"". And the twist at the midpoint of the movie is really the only big exposition dump, and it's like 3 minutes and actually quite interesting.I liked it. It was entertaining to me. I liked the lore expansion alot, it made sense to me. And I'm a sucker for lore.The biggest weakness of the movie to me, and others will feel totally different about this, is that I couldn't root for the Eternals. The movie didn't present an alternate solution to Arishem's plan to create a new Eternal and with it trillions of lives. Without an alternative what the Eternals are doing is just selfish to me. Safe Billions and prevent trillions from existing and also help the universe fall into darkness. To me the Eternal's decision was the wrong one here. It's definitely a dilemma, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth.Anyway, contrary to many others, I liked the Deviants. Their purpose wasn't to be the movie's antagonists, not at all. It was to show that the Deviants and the Eternals weren't so different, and after the ""Prime Deviant"" got Ajaks powers (free will as a part of it) we see that his objective changes. His objective is no longer to follow their creators design to kill all live on earth, but rather to protect his kind from the ones that want to harm them: The Eternals. I liked this. The Eternals are not the ""bad guys of this movie"". Actually, there isn't one. The movie is one big moral dilemma.Not everything worked well, but I'll give this a solid 8. It's not a dense movie.",Eternals
436,59,gavinp9,"Not bad, just a bit strained",6/10,4 November 2021,"'Eternals' is both a Marvel superhero film, but also not - unlike some other MCU films having lesser-known superheroes, this is almost a parallel universe, or a 'What If?' episode, with 10 new Eternals (good immortal aliens) introduced to us in 5,000BC that help save humans from Deviants (bad aliens), sent by Celestials (big aliens). The film spends most of it's time in 2021, but has plenty of flashbacks over the previous millennia.As they're not mainstream heroes, they all seem to have a generic power, with no-one being too special. As with all ensemble casts, not everyone gets much screen-time and it takes a while to figure out who does what and how they fit in. For the record, Ajak (Hayek) is the leader, with Sersi (Chan; the heart of the film) and Ikaris (Madden) essentially acting as the leads/love interests. The next most screen-time goes to Sprite (McHugh, the ""kid"") and Kingo (Nanjiani, a little comedic relief). Then there's Thena (Jolie, barely used), Phastos (Tyree Henry), Makkari (Ridloff), Druig (Keoghan, such a punchable face) and Gilgamesh (Dong-seok). Once you figure out who's who, it's basically over!There's not really a ""big bad guy"" as such, and the whole Celestials thing is pretty laughable, but if you go with it, there's still quite a bit that doesn't really come together until the end. The final 30min or so is pretty exciting, but there's certainly a sizeable lull in the middle. It certainly has it's moments, with some good CGI, but the stakes never seem quite as high as they should and the tone is often a bit too dour, with not as much fun and effervescence as I'd expect. The post-credits scenes create more questions for the next set of films to answer.",Eternals
437,60,flicklover,A total mess!!! But kind of won me over in the end!!!,6/10,6 November 2021,"Well here is another MCU film. One that has gotten some pretty negative reviews before it came out. I am not a believer in the internet determining my opinion on a film but it definitely can affect my expectations. I knew virtually nothing about Eternals. Not a fan of the comic so this was my first exposure to the story and characters.Eternals is about a group of immortal beings with superhuman powers that have lived on earth among us for thousands of years. Supposedly they are on earth to defend humanity against The Deviants. Their evil counterparts. The film is very much like The Avengers in that it tries to give most of the characters their moments. It is a big cast so I won't go into each characters but there are some standouts. Gemma Chan plays Sersi. Another chatacter that liked was Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. He us an inventor that is supposedly responsible for some inventions that he regrets such as the Atomic Bomb. The other characters are ok but one of the films weaknesses is that like most MCU films is that some characters seem to be in the film for comic relief. In the first hour I was not into the film. I was think that it
may definitely be the worst Marvel film I've seen. It felt slow and even though there was really high stakes in the story it seemed too jokey to take seriously. It even felt like a spoof at times. One other thing s the film goes back and forth in time to tells it's story. Between present day and thousands of years in the past. This style of storytelling works for me at times but here it was distracting. The film is directed by Chloé Zhao. A highly celebrated director of last year's Best Picture Nomadland. She has a great visual style and even though the action scenes are well done, they aren't much better than most MCU films. The difference here is that there are some heavier themes she deals with in the film. The problem is that it us so jokey at times that it diminished the more serious themes. This film is being sold as a very different take on a comic book film in the MCU. I do agree that it is a little different it pretty much like most other of the MCU films. It's not different enough but it dies try to distinguish itself at times.I'm glad to say that it wasn't the bomb that some were saying it was but I would say it's hit and miss. But it did grow on me a bit in the end.Grade: C+",Eternals
438,61,movieman6-413-929510,Eternals seems a bit too separate from the rest of the Marvel film series.,4/10,4 November 2021,"Eternals is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and part written by Chloé Zhao, the director of The Rider and Nomadland.The film is about a group of aliens called Eternals, who have been protecting humanity from evil creatures called Deviants since the beginning. Since the defeat of this evil, the Eternals have remained hidden on Earth without further affecting the lives of humanity, but after an unexpected tragedy, the Eternals must spring back into action to investigate this tragedy. Most are sure that this can only mean that the Deviants return to Earth.With this film, Chloé Zhao and fellow screenwriters introduce a new group of creatures to the Marvel film series. Due to the large unfamiliarity of this group and the fact that the co-screenwriters are at the beginning of their careers, this film may seem unclear to people who are otherwise unfamiliar with the Eternals. The reason that they only now appear in the film series also seems a bit forced and the film is also very separate from the rest of the Marvel film series. Only a few characters from the film series are mentioned by name, making this film almost as connected as the Marvel Netflix series.The story can also be tricky to follow, as it often jumps from the present to the past to give some brief explanations about certain things that come up later in the film. Furthermore, the Eternals observe humanity more and sometimes give their assessment. Chloé Zhao seems to have done this so that as a viewer you also get a kind of history lesson about the good and bad sides of humanity. In this way the film loses its entertaining side and it almost comes across as a kind of argument. The film also lacks real suspense, as this only comes when suddenly and Deviant shows up to cause some chaos. Marvel producer Kevin Feige may have been a little dazzled with arranging for Chloé Zhao as director after she broke into the film world last year after winning two Oscars. Chloé Zhao manages to capture a few scenes nicely, but these are the scenes that were filmed on location. Other scenes shot in the film studio seem less believable. The green screen is often clearly visible here, which makes the film lose its credibility. The CGI used for transferring the Deviants or the superpowers of the Eternals is often also clearly visible. These beings and powers do not always come across as credible. This film is the 26th film in the Marvel film series, which makes it special that after so many films, the effects suddenly seem to be less compared to most other films in the series. The film is also not necessary to see in 3D, because there are only a few scenes in which this effect can be seen.Due to the size of the film cast, the acting comes across as nice, but nobody really gets the chance to come across clearly as the main character of the film. All characters with their own powers and difficult names are difficult for the viewer to remember. At the end of the movie you don't know exactly who each character was and what they could do. Most characters are remembered more thanks to the actor who plays the character. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani remain the most remembered for their fame, despite the fact that these big names didn't even get the most time in the film.",Eternals
439,62,ayoreinf,Can we trust our gods?,9/10,8 November 2021,"This new team of super heroes is more than just ""different"" it's dealing with real deep issues one hardly ever finds in a comics book. It's more than the basic moral questions built into the comics genre, namely good versus evil; the responsibility coming with power; and who's watching over the watchmen? Which for themselves are deep moral questions that all the best comic based movies dealt with. This one asks us questions about free will; the overall sanctity of life; what is the nature of evolution? Do creatures that were created eternals and made to remain the same for eternity - Do they really remain the same?All these questions (and some I chose not to mention here to keep this thing from going way too long) push this comics saga into the realm of true science fiction. A realm only the X-Men visit regularly while other comics based movies only touch upon fleetingly. This is not a complaint - I love sci - fi with all my heart, I also love good comics, but the combination is really my personal favorite combination. Thing is, this calls for some very deft writing and directing - mission accomplished - It does make the movie slightly slower than most comics based movies but I found the story so riveting I hardly felt the time passing. The acting is superb, and I don't know who to commend because they all do their jobs as well as I could imagine it. The visuals, as some already mentioned here, are amazing, including some very nice timepieces that look spot on.Bottom line I loved it. It could easily sink into platitudes and slogans - but the writing and the acting kept it real. Go see it, but know in advance that you're stepping into uncharted territory.",Eternals
440,63,dommercaldi,Incredibly Boring And Tedious,4/10,20 November 2021,"Pros:
1. The fight scenes are entertaining, full of action and well choreographed.2. The special effects, as usual with Marvel films, are fantastic thus making sure the movie contains some semblance of realism.3. A few of the jokes land, mostly those that exist between Karun (Harish Patel) and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani).4. Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel have the best chemistry out of anyone which helps to elevate their humour.5. The cinematography is great and produces some really stunning shots.Cons:
1. Salma Hayek (Ajak) delivers an incredibly stale performance.2. The run-time is way too long. There are a plethora of useless sub-plots that go nowhere and they should have been axed, like the Deviant sub-plot.3. The logic permeating the film is largely wayward. For some strange reason only advanced beings are needed for the Eternals' masters, but then the Eternals aren't allowed to intervene when humans kill each other off.4. There are way too many characters. This means that not only is there little-to-no character development, but it also means that characters like Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo and Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) are given barely anything to do.5. Most of the humour falls flat on its face as it's inappropriately inserted and needlessly forced.6. There's way too much corny and regurgitated dialogue about how humans aren't perfect but they're worth saving.7. All of the romances are forced, they're laughably weak and are clearly there to pad out time.8. The transitions between the modern day and the past are far too jarring, and only seem included to dump exposition on the audience.",Eternals

443,66,darkreignn,Unexpectedly entertaining,8/10,7 November 2021,"With movies such as ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" gracing the catalogue of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it's a wonder to me that ""Eternals"" is the MCU motion picture that has the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score. However, before watching ""Eternals,"" I wasn't surprised - super hero fatigue is the newest disease that seems to be infecting the public. All of that said, imagine my genuine shock when the credits rolled and I found myself actually having enjoyed this movie quite a bit. ""Eternals"" isn't perfect, but its genuinely exciting action, intriguing narrative, and shocking surprises make for a super hero movie that, while not breaking the mold, doesn't fit perfectly into it.""Eternals"" starts strong with an action sequence taking place in the year 5000 B. C. Featuring our titular heroes, the Eternals are shown fighting monsters known as the Deviants. The Eternals' powers are depicted in all their spectacular glory, and while many of them are similar to specific DC counterparts (The Flash and Superman will come immediately to mind), it doesn't make this sequence, and their powers, any less exciting. The Eternals aren't afraid to slice, dice, and otherwise demolish the Deviants, which can make for some brutal fights, especially for a Marvel movie. However, one thing that can and will manage to put a damper on your enjoyment of this film's action is the fact that many of the sequences take place in dimly lit, nighttime environments. No doubt an attempt to save money on computer generated images, this stylistic decision makes many action scenes difficult to comprehend - as you can imagine, this is particularly infuriating because, after all, ""Eternals"" is an action film.That said, even if I had to strain my eyes to decipher the onscreen happenings, I found myself enjoying the action scenes as a whole because, well, I started to really take a liking to many of the characters. Yes, ""Eternals"", which is no doubt a long film, does contain the trademarked Marvel mediocre dialogue and rushed characterization. So I'm not sure if it was the charisma of the actors and actresses or what, but I began to truly find myself entertained by the Eternals and their interactions with one another. Richard Madden as Ikaris and Lia McHugh as Sprite were the two standouts for me; usually I dislike child actors in films, but Lia was very good playing an immortal super hero who so desperately wants to live a normal life. Richard Madden's Ikaris was immediately likable - headstrong and cocky when he wants to be, and resilient and steadfast when he must, Ikaris brought some genuine surprises in this film, especially in the last act. Most of the other actors were good as well, but unfortunately, underutilized. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek play small, but pivotal roles in this movie; they are both top tier actresses, so I was really hoping they'd play a bigger part. Barry Keoghan as Druig is also a show stealer, with one scene in particular featuring him being my favorite of the entire film.The story that ""Eternals"" decides to tell may not be the freshest, but the way it is told is certainly unique. Featuring scenes that take place in both modern day and in the past, ""Eternals"" feels like a sprawling adventure. Chloé Zhao's directing adds a stylistic flair that is much needed, especially when compared to the other fairly flat looking Marvel movies. She is also unafraid to tell this story by shocking the audience; I found the twists and turns to be very unexpected - I won't spoil them in this review, but let's just say the formulaic CGI boss battle that most super hero movies employ isn't necessarily the direction that Zhao decides to take this story.Honestly, I'm slightly shocked by how poorly received this film has been. When compared to other films in the MCU, ""Eternals"" is, in my opinion, one of the better ones. Much less predictable and formulaic, this film's unique story and entertaining characters makes for an enjoyable super hero experience.",Eternals
444,67,FallenEye,"Eternals ""Abort"" Mission on Mother Earth.",6/10,8 November 2021,"Unfortunately Eternals managed to fill an entire two and a half hours with mostly pretty pictures and pretty people, with the story and its logic, intrigue and engagement falling by the wayside, leaving Eternals to playout more like an over budget CW show rather than a quality MCU instalment.When compared to additions that have similar runtimes in the franchise, like The Avengers, Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame and even Age of Ultron, it becomes even clearer that Eternals is an inferior inclusion. It simply did not use its time effectively. With all the time it had, it didn't manage to establish any of the characters properly, accept maybe Sprite, which made their motivations inconsequential for the audience.How the Eternals ended up defeating the Celestial left much to be desired as well, as it was in a way the was very throwaway-like, somewhat convenient, and easy, while the fact that these Eternals can even defeat universe creating Celestials is rather questionable itself, and even though that may be based on the comic book material, the movie failed in making it a plausible feat.Also, these Celestials making mistakes like not erasing memories properly, creating creatures they can't control, and not establishing fail-safes to ensure that the Prime Eternals submit to their demands, feels incredibly stupid for beings that ought to have an out of this world level of intellect.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the battle between Makkari and Ikaris; the imagery there was stunning, while these two characters were also perhaps the best in the movie, along with Sprite.In the end, Marvel Studios under Kevin Feige is incapable of making ""bad"" movies at this point, therefore, Eternals is not a bad movie, however, its simply not good enough. Its story is flawed, humor at most parts is misplaced/not funny as usual, has very little character development, lacks energetic engagement, and has a forgettable score, but, the cinematography, some of the action scenes and the actors were good at different levels, while the overall project was adequately decent.6.4/10.",Eternals

It shows the team of very powerful creatures made by the most powerful creature. Sometimes their decisions are illogical. Also I like that film has humour but sometimes it's in the wrong moment. Secondly, the cast is the best part of film, they are awesome. Thirdly, the visual effects and atmosphere are amazing, it has special style of film's director.So, it's average film that only connected with MCU.

446,69,namob-43673,Excellent superhero movie and much better than I thought,9/10,4 November 2021,"Superhero movies are so many now and they seem to pop up almost every month so I think most of us are getting jaded. However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time.Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" is very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree.

447,70,namob-43673,Excellent superhero movie and much better than I thought,9/10,4 November 2021,"Superhero movies are so many now and they seem to pop up almost every month so I think most of us are getting jaded. However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time. Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" are often very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better. I want Eternals 2 now!There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. Top marks in all categories and extremely high production value. 9/10 and I highly recommend.",Eternals
448,71,TheVictoriousV,"More like eternally long, amirite?",4/10,5 November 2021,"By casting an actress that has already played a major part in one of the films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has run into a problem it frankly should've run into sooner, given the sheer size of it (just look at how quickly it happened with the poor saps at DC, casting Djimon Hounsou in two separate roles in films released not four months apart). We now have Gemma Chan, who played a Kree in Captain Marvel, in the role of a peaceful Eternal.The most important question on your mind right now is probably: Wait, what's an Eternal? And how have I missed that there's a new Marvel Studios movie out?Indeed, Eternals seems to have the Marvel geeks mildly enthused at best (I'll include myself here if ""pretty decent knowledge"" counts as being a Marvel geek, even if I've had mixed reactions towards the MCU). This may be because this feels like a more generic MCU prequel, focusing squarely on a particular character or group. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the MCU, we have the aftermath of Thanos' ""snap"" and boy is sh-t getting freaky!We've had Wanda Maximoff creating a pocket dimension wherein other universes appeared to ""bleed through"", which, even though it was a fake-out, led to exploring different timelines within the MCU we all know and then seemingly getting into PREVIOUS big-screen Marvel universes, judging from what we know of the next Spider-Man movie -- which, yes, is set to star both the Maguire and Garfield versions of the web-slinger (don't get me started on the Morbius trailer). Eternals? Yawn.Okay, on to some actual new review content: From what I've understood of Marvel Comics lore, the Eternals are the people of Thanos (who's also a ""Titan"" but I guess that's more to do with migration) and since that villain needs to be upstaged, the only possibility is Galactus, but we don't even get a tease for him here. Another thing that would make sense, now that we're getting real cosmic, is a follow-up on Guardians of the Galaxy's tease for Adam Warlock but no cigar. The Eternals themselves don't have much marquee value and the trailers have done little to make anyone but the hardcore Marvel simps especially hopeful.What this means, as I'm sure you've noticed, is that the Usual Journalists have had to bend over even further backwards than normal to make this film seem remotely exciting. I've seen reviews that grasp at all the straws they can find to paint this bland, bloated video game-looking garbage as great filmmaking (even when the reviews praise nothing in particular), and writers of the same ilk have had to REALLY doll out the ""firsts"" -- first gay superhero, first deaf superhero, first *insert race* superhero, first MCU sex scene (the first Iron Man begs to differ), and so on. Did you think all those sexist Black Widow haters were bad? Well, just you wait. You're all kinds of -phobe if you don't like this one!We learn that these Eternals have watched over humankind for thousands of years, including years where they definitely could've lent a hand in defeating the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, or indeed Thanos. We do learn that they were instructed by the all-powerful Celestials to only interfere if ""Deviants"" are involved. We learn all kinds of things, but don't really wind up liking anyone, nor do we get to see anything that sets these powerful, humanoid aliens apart from most of the other powerful, humanoid aliens we've seen in the MCU -- apart from when they generate swirly gold that looks kind of cool. One of them even borrows a trick from Loki.The cast is rich, to be sure, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani (whose ""Bollywood"" scenes constitute a highlight), Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, and Harry Styles as Thanos' brother Starfox (and yes, the Mad Titan's sibling looked like a boyband twink in the comics too). These actors do fine, but their assignment is to play generic comic-book characters in a generic MCU film that I'm forgetting more and more as I'm writing this -- aside from a few truly cringeworthy jokes and bizarre references to DC Comics.At least we're getting Blade soon, apparently.",Eternals
449,72,ariqakbar,Ambitious.,7/10,11 November 2021,"Ambitious, let me say that.The mistake that almost all of us gonna do, is to set to high expectation about this movie. Imo, lower it, and u will enjoy this movie more than what most people said.Eternal is supposed to set something bigger in this second phase, i assume. For such a big task, one movie with quite long duration is not enough. Take ur time marvel, its a big world. With this, the movie seem lost his way a couple of time. It try to catch everything's. We lost the attachment to the characters.The visual was great, intimacy communication its also good, this movie has so much potential.But overall for me, it still a 'good' movie. Not 8 star good, but still good.",Eternals
450,73,Chalice_Of_Evil,Eternal love...,8/10,4 November 2021,"Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest. I personally was holding out hope that this would finally be an MCU film with a group of characters from space who I actually liked and weren't a bunch of a-holes. An opening crawl not only explains who Eternals are, but Deviants and Celestials too. There's enough exposition through dialogue to answer any questions one might have whilst watching (such as why these Eternals were 'Switzerland' during the battle against Thanos). Complaints about this film being 'confusing' because it alternates between past and present must be from those with short attention spans, as it's quite obvious what time period the movie's in at any given time thanks to helpful location title cards. Too many characters? I think not. Endgame had 30-something characters and nobody complained. Each of these Eternals has a distinct personality.Salma Hayek gives good wise leader as Ajak, who can heal, but her decision-making causes some conflict with the others. Gemma Chan (who I became a fan of thanks to her nuanced performance in the TV series Humans) has a certain quality about her that makes her the perfect fit for Sersi, whose power is molecular manipulation. She experiences self-doubt, but there's more to her than she thinks. Long ago she was involved with Richard Madden's character, Ikaris, who's kind of like Superman (one unexpected thing in this movie is the shout-outs to the MCU 'rivals', DC, with the Superman/Batman mentions) with the flying/eyebeams/super-strength. Over the course of the movie we find out why he left Sersi, and like her character, he's got more going on than you might expect. Madden's a natural fit as the 'leading man' type and he really brings it when it comes to conveying the conflicted emotions his character feels.Kit Harington plays Dane Whitman, who's someone Sersi could be happy with until Ikaris' return throws a spanner in the works. Those wishing to see the two GoT actors reunited onscreen should be happy with the scene where their characters size each other up, but thankfully it never descends into teen drama love triangle angst. After watching the trailers, the one character I wasn't sure I'd be fond of was the young-in-appearance redheaded girl, Sprite, whose power is creating illusions. Whilst she isn't *too* bad for the majority of the movie, she did annoy me towards the end and I was peeved she didn't face suitable consequences for her actions, instead seemingly being *rewarded* with something she'd always wanted (her crush on older-looking men/willingness to follow them no matter what makes her seem quite shallow). Turns out my first instincts/gut reaction to her was correct. She's a brat.They soon seek out the other Eternals because a cataclysmic event called 'the Emergence' (involving a Celestial, that's big enough to dwarf a planet, hatching from the planet Earth...which is bad news for humanity) is imminent. They first find Kingo (whose power is shooting beams similar to Ikaris' eyebeams...except from his hands) filming Bollywood movies. He provides a bit of light relief from the doom/gloom, but it's his valet, Karun, who steals their scenes. Gilgamesh (who punches really hard) and Thena (who kicks major ar$e) next rejoin the group, and there was a nice dynamic between them. Angelina Jolie may surprise some with how much emotion she brings to the role of Thena. She has something happen to her which proves a problem for everyone, but Gilgamesh stands by her, making for a good character relationship. Characters who arrive later include Druig (a mind-controller), Makkari (a speedster) and Phastos (an inventor). Each serves a purpose in the story and the actors do the most with what they're given.It was nice to have a memorable/epic theme tune in an MCU movie again and the film's score is quite beautiful, as is the cinematography. There are breathtaking shots throughout, the fights feel visceral, the CGI is as convincing as one can hope for in creating such otherworldly things (those Celestials are quite the sight to behold) and I don't get complaints about the Eternals' costumes (as I, for one, welcome anything that isn't Thor: Ragnarok-esque/looking like it could be purchased at a discount costume shop). I saw people ragging on the 'basic'/'cheap'-looking Eternals spaceship, but I appreciate the simplicity of their ship wedge. Sci-fi movies seem to want to keep creating more and more outlandish-looking ships and eventually it'll reach the point where they become SO bizarre-looking you'll wonder, ""WTF kind of functionality does that have?"". There are mid-credits/post-credits scenes to hang around for; the former introducing what seems like a rather important character (whose casting may surprise some) while the latter promises more to come for a certain character/actor who felt a bit underutilized in this film.I'm annoyed at the fact people have been badmouthing this film (some giving it 1/10 star ratings without even having *seen* it). Yes, the movie's 'different', but that's not a BAD thing. Some had complained about the MCU being 'formulaic', yet when it tries something new/different, they complain about that too. I LIKE the fact that this movie offered something we hadn't seen before. It was refreshing. Quite a few of the MCU films have been popular with the 'majority' whilst I personally haven't liked them, then there have been a few ones that haven't been that popular that I've actually liked. So, this criticism Eternals is receiving means very little to me. Also, you have to factor in that this movie features some things that will make a certain group of individuals biased against it/rate it far lower than it deserves. I honestly don't know why anyone puts so much faith in one website and its ratings to determine whether a movie is 'successful' or not, when really what EVERYONE should be doing is seeing it for themselves before they judge instead of bandwagon-jumping. I, for one, hope we get to see more of these Eternals and that the negative reviews/haters don't rob us of that.",Eternals
451,74,GomezAddams666,In Marvel We Trust,9/10,7 November 2021,"I know the critics and audiences are sharply divided over this film, but you should listen to the fans, and as a True Believer I can tell you this movie is fantastic.I honestly think it was absolutely awesome and quite innovating for a cinematic universe with more than twenty-two movies in their catalog.The characters are alien in nature, but they display a large range of human emotions. Besides, the casting is magnificent and the direction is just beautifully paced.It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it does not deserve the hate it gets.Please never trust the critics' consensus, they do not have your best interests at heart.

452,75,Lewis_Heather787,Oh no.......*face palm*,3/10,6 November 2021,"This is going to be a biased review, plain and simple. Firstly I don't care about these (MCU) films anymore whatsoever, thought it would be better after ""Endgame"" to just stop the franchise. Why do they need to keep making films..............oh yeah for money.........my bad I just remembered. If I'm being honest I have been in the minority for a long time, the MCU to me is very hit and miss............although I never thought they could miss this poorly.Lets try and talk about some positives first. Let me think here Mmmm.......... Gemma Chan was trying very hard to at least give some resemblance of a good performance however with this script its almost impossible. She carried the film well and did standout so congrats to her, its not her fault this film is bad. Also Angelina Jolie......*sigh*......for years there have been rumours that she had turned down offers to appear in ""comic book"" films. This is the one that she picked! For me she is the best part of the film, which isn't saying much, however her performance throughout is good and her character is slightly interesting. She deserved a better film!!!The rest of the cast, I cant really remember. A few of them were really annoying and bland. Not very memorable whatsoever.Sadly though there is going to be a certain section of society that will hate this film regardless of seeing it or for its actual issues. I do like the very bold attempt and showing probably the most diverse cast of characters in a film I think I've seen period. Chloe Zhao and Kevin Feige should be applauded for doing this and hopefully with some luck this will become so normal that we won't have to talk about it or bring it up. The diversity of the film is not its problem !! For me its issues are far far worse then that!!Story!!! My god is this story bland, boring, unoriginal, overly complicated, cliche, laughable and just all over the place. I don't think I've seen many films from Marvel, under the Disney umbrella, that have been as messy as this one. From my point of view this film has too many characters and plot points going on for its own good. Introducing a lot of brand new information to the audience for the first time...........its a lot to take in. Sadly the film does not pull it off whatsoever!!To me this film is a brand new modern state of the art skyscraper but with the foundations of three old wooden chair legs. The film may look good from the outside, have a good cast and decent special effects however its (foundation) story and place in this universe does not make one bit of sense.Its obvious to me that they rushed this into production, its even more surprising considering the fact this film was delayed a year for covid. ""Eternals"" should have been split up into multiple films, that way the story and characters could have had more time to be fleshed out. However with a 2hr 30 min runtime, this film feels like an eternity already.30% out 100 this film is bad at its core. Two decent performances, some ok character interaction. However its surrounded by a dull, boring and unoriginal rushed story that is all over the place. If you loved this film great, good for you.........this film have major issues for me, its sadly though in 2021 not the thing thats gonna be talked about.",Eternals
453,76,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Its not a rotten film,8/10,5 November 2021,"Having just gotten back home from seeing the film, I honestly dont get the hate it was getting. Its certainly not a ""rotten film"". My biggest issue is that with it being a team movie vs a solo, I did feel there was a lot of backstory to set up. And unfortunetly I think some characters get more development than others. But I overall enjoyed it. I thought it had a good balance of action, comedy and emotion. And while I didnt cry, I nearly did with a certain scene involving Ikarus and Sersi. I also liked the character building done for Sprite. She reminded me of ""Claudia"" from Interview with the Vampire"" in a lot of ways. And I loved what it had to say around ""religion"" and blindy following your faith. I thought it was a very interesting and fascinating movie and definitely would be interested in expanding upon the mythos and characters. Not a perfect movie by any means. I would rank it, i dont know....maybe somewhere between 12-20. I'd possibly have to do some rewatches to get an exact number, but I think I can fairly say its not a top 10 film, nor is it bottom of the bunch. I'd rate this film a 7.5 (I rounded up to 8 here).

454,77,Avwillfan89,Around the world in under three hours.,5/10,19 November 2021,"This is the first MCU movie that I've seen in the cinema that actively bored me. You know you're in trouble when the film starts with a written prologue - like Star Wars.There are a lot of firsts with this film along with the prologue: First gay superhero, first deaf superhero and first sex scene in a marvel film. Yet for all of its inclusivity points, all of its beauty and gold (lost and lots of gold) the script absolutely sucked.The incessant globe trotting and flashbacks didn't help either. The first time I saw the trailer, I thought: there are too many characters. Not only are there too many super heroes for one movie, but way too much exposition with the celestials and the Eternals's purpose.I don't understand why this couldn't have been a TV series , as there are so many on Disney+ right now and this could have been the perfect new entry and it would have benefited way more.",Eternals
455,78,sirwillisiv,Doesn't really know what it's trying to be...,4/10,17 November 2021,"Eternals, the lowest rated Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet. Does it deserve that? Ugh, yeah. I didn't want to believe it but this film is a mess. It's slow, cluttered, disjointed and severely lacking charisma. With Nomadland's Chloe Zhao at the helm, Eternals takes a more ambitious and artful route, which I can somewhat appreciate. She nails the scope and atmosphere but superheroes just don't resonate with her craft. Despite a couple twists that I didn't see coming, there's little to no character in the acting, the story is overloaded with exposition, the humor feels awkward and forced, and the substandard CGI, messy editing and excessively shadowy color correction makes the action sequences a bit of an eyesore; unimpressive given past Marvel efforts. Eternals is an overlong tedious slog that doesn't really know what it's trying to be. I'd toss it in the mediocre pile with Thor: The Dark World and Captain Marvel.

It's not as action packed as The Avengers and Iron Man but it is still a good entry into the Marvel Universe movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning and like all Marvel and DC films, the music was spot on. The main characters were well established and the actors were well cast. The storyline is very Marvel formula which I think is going to eventually become a problem as people will become so used to it that they will become bored. But that was not the case here. The story was interesting enough to keep me watching and the dynamic between the different characters kept me engaged. I found myself liking these characters and wanting to follow their stories.The special effects were great, but with both Marvel and DC, I would expect nothing less. There were a couple of small twists but nothing really huge and there were a few side characters that were really likable and engaging.

463,86,fredschaefer-406-623204,Who are the Eternals?,9/10,7 November 2021,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe jumps head on into its next phase with Chloe Zhao's adaptation of the ETERNALS, based on characters created by Jack Kirby back in 1976, for what would be a 19 issue run of a series that initially was separate from the rest of the Marvel continuity at the time. Kirby's original series was strongly influence by Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, and the Arthur C. Clarke story it was based on in that worked off the theme of a highly advanced alien civilization coming to earth thousands of years in the past, and then guiding human evolution. In Kirby's book, the title characters are super powered beings who are given the responsibility of watching over development of humanity by the Celestials, a race of giant, omnipotent beings, who will one day return and judge if the human race is worthy of continuing their existence. These 10 Eternals appear to be humans, and live among them, but are forbidden to interfere with the course of human history, standing aside during wars, genocides, and every manner of catastrophe. Their opposites are the Deviants, mutated Eternals, physically ugly, and their sworn enemies, whom the Eternals protect humanity from. Over time, Kirby's characters were integrated into the Marvel continuity, with some members serving with The Avengers.Kirby had a great knack for writing epic space opera stories, as evidence by his work with Stan Lee on the early FANTASTIC FOUR series, and later with the NEW GODS over at DC Comics, a series filled with heroes and villains possessing God like powers. Jack Kirby was a genius in conveying the grandeur and the power of such sagas on the comic page, but film, on the other hand, has often in the past, proved not up to the task of translating stories filled with these incredibly powerful beings to the screen; as evidence I site what happened with Galactus (a creation of Kirby) in that FANTASTIC FOUR movie. On that matter, I do think the ETERNALS got it right, doing justice to the legacy of King Kirby, and giving us a film that is entertaining, though not without flaws, and one which pushes the MCU in a new direction, one that seems to draw back upon Marvel comics of the '70s, which any long time fan can tell you, was filled with a lot of craziness, and I don't mean that as criticism.At its heart, the ETERNALS, like the X-Men and The Avengers, is the story of a family, a group of siblings who must decide if they will bend to their parents' will, or decide what is right for themselves, and the humans they have come to care for so much. This family consists of: Selma Hayak as their leader Ajak, the only one capable of communicating with the Celestials; Ikaris, played by Richard Madden, who shoots laser beams from his eyes, and has the gift of flight; Sersi, played by Gemma Chan, who can transmute matter into any material she chooses; Kingo, played by Kumail Nanjaini, who can shoot deadly energy beams from his hands; Gilgamesh, played by Don Lee (who was everyone's favorite character in TRAIN TO BUSAN) who possesses super strength that rivals Thor and The Hulk; Sprite, played by Lia McHugh, a child who can create illusions; Druig, played by Barry Keoghan, who has the power of telepathy and mind control; Makkari; played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff, who has super speed; Phastos, played by Brian Tyree Henry, a technological genius; and Thena, portrayed by Angelina Jolie, a warrior who uses energy to create weapons. Of this large group, it is former lovers Chan and Madden who get the most screen time, evening sharing the MCU's first PG-13 sex scene, but most to the others have their moments as well, and I think the film does a decent job of getting us invested with these characters. The story hues very close to the three act arc of most Marvel films: the first act establishes who is who among the Eternals with their arrival on Earth 7,000 years ago to save prehistoric humanity from the Deviants, we learn their powers, conflicts and tensions and what ultimately scattered them across the globe up to the present with the re-emergence of the Deviants post Thanos/Endgame; the second act concerns the reuniting of the team, where some members like Chan and Henry have assimilated themselves well among humans, while others, like Madden and Keoghan have kept their distance, in the face of the renewed threat from the Deviants, ending in a jungle confrontation and battle where there are casualties, and the hidden truth about the Celestials is revealed; setting the stage for the third act where the Eternals must square off against their creators for the sake to the planet and people they have come to love. The finale has betrayals and the requisite battle where everything is at stake and the heroes are pushed to the wall, seemingly with no chance of victory until...I found a lot to like in this movie, despite its flaws, which include an opening act very heavy with exposition and time jumps, as there is a lot to learn in a short time. The nominal villains, the Deviants, are introduced in the first half, and factor heavily in the story only to all but disappear as a threat in the second half when their leader is dispatched by Jolie; some characters don't get near enough screen time, like the very talented Ridloff. Some of the humor works, some of it doesn't; this is not GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. What really works is the casting, which is spot on, especially Jolie, Lee, and Keoghan; Chan is excellent in what amounts to the lead role, she might be my new favorite MCU heroine. Nanjaini really stands out as an immortal who has found a home as a Bollywood star. This might be the most gorgeous looking MCU film ever, as Zhao did a lot of location filming in places like the Canary Islands. The effects do their job, and the sequence where the Dreaming Celestial partially rises from the earth is proof that this film has truly captured Kirby original vision. At over two and a half hours, ETERNALS is long, but for me, it went by fast. Marvel and Disney clearly took a risk by making a film built around what to many fans are definitely obscure heroes, but they pulled it off, and making it clear that the MCU is not afraid to move into uncharted territory going forward, that it doesn't need Steve Rogers and Tony Stark to make compelling movies.And speaking of the future, there are a couple of end credits scenes that raise the stakes nicely: welcome to the MCU Harry Styles and Kit Harrington.",Eternals
464,87,hunter-friesen,Another cog in the Marvel machine,6/10,5 November 2021,"How is it that Chloé Zhao's previous film ""Nomadland,"" about a woman wandering the Midwest in a van, is more interesting and full of life than a $200 million blockbuster filled with literal gods?Both a coincidence and not a coincidence, ""Eternals"" and ""Dune"" share the same release window and many of the same elements. Both are technically well-crafted and beautiful films done on an epic scale featuring diversely interesting casts. Both cover vast amounts of space and time in attempts at worldbuilding for future sequels. And both share an emptiness on the page that keeps them from surviving anywhere past their runtimes. It's a shame that prestigious filmmakers like Chloé Zhao and Denis Villeneuve chose to make their least interesting films at the same time.But before I reveal my hand too early, let's back things up to the beginning of time, literally. ""In the beginning...,"" reads the opening crawl, a Celestial by the name of Arishem created the universe and all living things that inhabit it. Like the story in the Bible, this god was not perfect, as he created a monstrous race known as the ""Deviants"" that threatened the natural order of life. To right his wrong, Arishem created the ""Eternals"" to wipe out the Deviants and bring peace. For 7,000 years the Eternals have been Earth's watchful protectors, subtly guiding humanity to what it is today.But Arishem's imperfection begins to sow seeds of doubt within the Eternals. That doubt leads them to discover the real reason they have been dispatched to this planet, which is to prepare it for the ""emergence"" that would bring about the end of humanity. Do the Eternals go against their maker by preventing his grand plan, or do they sacrifice billions for the idea of the greater good?Just on paper, ""Eternals"" is Marvel's biggest feature to date in terms of scope and possibility. About a dozen new characters are introduced, all with unique powers. There's one with super speed, one that can control minds, and another that flies around and shoots laser beams out of his eyes like Superman (a reference made more times than you would think within the film).Marvel has always had a gift when it comes to casting their famed superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. Being cast as Iron Man was seen as an unnecessary gamble, and more eyebrows were raised when unknowns Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were cast as Thor and Loki, respectively. Just two months ago, Simu Liu proved all the doubters wrong with his terrific turn as Shang-Chi.But while all those risks have paid off, this large bet doesn't bring back the expected return on investment. A few names, like Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and Angelina Jolie are either miscast or not good enough for their roles. And for those that are good, such as Gemma Chan as Sersi and Richard Madden as Ikaris, their characters are too flat to inspire anything memorable about them except their names and what powers they have.But there are a few wins within this cast that should be championed, such as the first hearing-impaired superhero in Makkari, and the first openly gay couple in Phastos and Ben. There's also the first Marvel sex scene, lasting all of eight seconds. While celebration should be in order, these inclusionary acts are still baby steps for the Mouse House, who have always embodied the urban dictionary term of ""passive progressive.""""Eternals"" is also the most interesting Marvel movie on a purely technical level. That's not to say it's the best, but that it's different in a refreshing way. Zhao, newly armed with Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, makes the most radical departure from the plastic formula that has engulfed this franchise for the better part of its life. Along with DP Ben Davis (who also shot the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" as well as ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Captain Marvel"") Zhao leans for a desaturated, naturalistic look, similar to that of her previous features. The plains of South Dakota and the jungles of the Amazon are filled with beauty as she always seems to find and harness the magic hourBut those moments of visual originality are brief and sporadic. Once the special effects and action set pieces inevitably barge their back way in, it's back to business as usual.This bait-and-switch act begs the question: If even the most independent-minded filmmaker like Zhao can't break free from the corporate chains, who can? It's a question that I don't want to think about, as the answer is the one I fear the most: nobody can. That gloominess I feel may not be shared by those that have stayed loyal to this rewarding franchise. For those that came into this clinging on to the last bits of hope that someone could shake things up, this movie may very well be the death knell to that. But at the end of the day, did I truly expect anything different in Marvel's 26th entry?",Eternals
465,88,daniellawson-14-787057,Good moments and themes; but it's a MESS,6/10,10 November 2021,"POSITIVES:1) Angelina Jolie is a great actress and really adds some gravitas to the film
2) There are definitely some great themes in the film and some very deep questions that are asked. It's a shame this wasn't explored in more depth
3) The action scenes were mostly shot very well and the direction in general was good
4) You do get the sense that the characters are a family and this made their interaction scenes very engaging to watch
5) The twist was actually pretty good and surprisingNEGATIVES:1) It's a MESS. It felt like watching 4 films crammed into 1
2) The constant switching of locations, times and characters made it very difficult to care about what was happening
3) The valet character was SO ANNOYING and actually all of the film's attempts at humour fell flat on their face for me
4) The post credit scenes were both a waste of time
5) The massive stakes that the film has basically made me think back to films like Iron Man, Ant Man and Black Widow and just think that the MCU has gone sooo over the top that now those older films with their more grounded stakes feel completely pointless.",Eternals
466,89,Come-and-Review,"Not the worst MCU film, neither the best",7/10,7 November 2021,"The answer to the question that most are asking, following the huge internet buzz that resulted from the release of critics ratings, is this: it is definitely far from being the worst MCU film, but as a MCU film, it's not the most memorable one, even if, thanks to Zhao, visually and storyline-wise it is one of the most distinct Marvel films.Zhao's film balances rather safely between being a film belonging to the MCU system and being a Zhao film. There are minor elements of Zhao's cinematic poetics that permain. Even if Zhao's touch is palpable, what prevails is the dimension of the film as a MCU film.In an almost unprecedented fashion, Eternals is non-linear in its story structure, one of its many perks. The issue in the first 40 minutes of the movie is that the flashback scenes prove to be more interesting than the main storyline. It feels almost as if this parallel storyline could have been expanded in a more interesting full feature film. Eventually, threads are connected and the non-linear structure becomes interconnected enough to justify the unification of the subjects in one single film, but the ""present day"" storyline lacks coherence in some aspects.Ultimately, the biggest issue of Eternals is inherently linked to it being an MCU film. The Marvel signature approach, that demystifies superhero characters and turns them into comic figures, flawed and human, hardly works well for a set of god-like entities with millenary lifespan that have guided the early evolution of mankind, such as the Eternals.In terms of MCU lore, Eternals brought forward a vast area of expansion, that if implemented well, might possibly lead to new directions for the franchise. Weighing the pros and cons, Eternals leans more towards the postive, but its flaws prevents it from utmost greatness.(full review on comeandreview)",Eternals
467,90,gcsman,Ignore the trolls! There's a lot to like in this new MCU film.,8/10,9 November 2021,"With the exception of just two or three little lines of dialog that reference previous movies, Eternals is the closest thing to a new, truly stand-alone story that Marvel has done since Iron Man in 2008 -- a whole new cast of characters we haven't seen before, anywhere. That alone is refreshing! I see that director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland, The Rider) is getting slammed by numerous critics for (a) being too much of an auteur director to do superhero films, or (b) abandoning her auteur status to do superhero films, or worst of all (c) daring to introduce (shock! Horror!) a *gay relationship*, right there on screen! The trolls who are piling on with ridiculous 1/10 ratings are I suppose reacting to that third item most of all. She can't win. Just ignore all of this and go enjoy the actual movie. And there's a lot to enjoy. There are loads of action scenes, new characters to get acquainted with, some decent character development, and an expansion of the MCU universe in a new direction.I liked the settings and scenes quite a lot. Most of it happens (gasp) outdoors, away from labs or big cities (or sound stages with lots of green-screen CGI). Yes there are scenes in London particularly, but most of it happens in big-sky country settings like Australia, North Dakota, Alaska, the Canary Islands. It just feels more open and natural than so many other MCU movies. And this is reflected in the cinematography -- lots of long shots where the Eternals team is seen in the landscape rather than constant tight focus headshots. So in the big dust-up scenes between the Eternals and the Deviants (or among themselves) they don't even leave destroyed cities behind them, a nice change from the Avengers.This is also quite a visually strong movie. The signature superhero 'effect' for each Eternal is the way they call up filigrees of light in complex geometric pattern, especially Thena (Angelina Jolie). It's repetitive, but oddly I didn't get tired of seeing those because they are so effective and gracefully done. Their team costumes have handsome, attractive designs (better than their comic versions by far). The way Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) show off their powers is great: Ikaris' Superman-like fight in the air with the Deviants is the best we've seen done since Man of Steel (2013), and Makkari's super-speed is probably the best special effects work in the film. And, the end credits are just plain beautifully rendered.And about the acting: it's a big job to introduce a double fistful of entirely new characters all at once AND tell a good story. But it's been done before, with the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy. Gemma Chan (Sersi) and Richard Madden (Ikaris) turn out to be the two main leads and they are just fine -- they've both had previous practice runs at this type of production and I got the impression that they know what's expected of them. Angelina Jolie was potentially an equally major character but she seemed to be a little underused -- or else her character's particular plot line just wasn't the central one in this rather sprawling multi-pronged story. Salma Hayek (Ajak), Don Lee (Gilgamesh), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari), and Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos) are all fine too -- they totally fit. But I felt a bit disappointed by Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) who just didn't seem to jell -- Keoghan especially wasn't convincing at all; he seemed to be way out of place in this type of thing.Lastly, the way the Celestials were used -- the giant cosmic beings who are Behind It All -- surprised me. A sneaky message that I haven't seen anyone else mention is that we now know what the Celestials are really all about. The big cosmic mission of the Celestials is ....... to breed more Celestials! That's their imperative, just like the simplest biological organisms. The particular way they do that is the mainspring of the storyline and I won't give any more away.I was reading Marvel comics way back when, when the Eternals were introduced, but I didn't follow them. They were the creations of the legendary Jack Kirby but after his long runs on the Fantastic Four and other classic titles, I thought he finally lost it: Frankly, his drawing became too crude and blocky, and his 'dialog' was even worse. He came up with names for them that are just silly mashups of gods and heroes from mythology (Ikaris for Icarus; Thena for Athena; Makkari for Mercury; Phastos for Hephaestus; Sersi for Circe; Gilgamesh for --- Gilgamesh; and Druig for who-knows-what). This Eternals movie is better than those comics by far.",Eternals
468,91,jjburkekid,"Had Lots of Potential, But Is Underwhelming",5/10,15 November 2021,"Even with this film, I don't think the MCU should stop trying new things. Even if this film was mediocre, with the right crew, they can make a great and unique film.With that said, I'm very mixed about Eternals. I liked some of the film, but not enough to warrant a good review.THE GOOD:
-I loved the visuals in this film. I actually think that Eternals has one of the best visual effects in the MCU, with it's beautiful scenery, great effects on the super powers, and having good designs for the deviants.-While some are underwhelming, I enjoyed a few of the characters. I thought Thena's characters was unique and interesting, with her losing her memories, and going crazy. It's a shame we didn't see more of her in action. Even if we saw barely anything of him, I really liked Phastos. I thought he was a funny and kind of investing. Another character I really liked was Makkari. Even if she couldn't say a word, I really liked her personality, and her speed effects were one of the best I've seen in a long time. I also thought Kingo was funny, and I liked him.-Unlike others, I didn't find the film to be that boring. The 2h 37m were actually pretty fast for me.-I thought the fight scenes were visually stunning, action packed, and a lot of fun.-Even if it failed, I appreciate the MCU for trying something different with their storytelling with this film.THE BAD:
-Besides the characters I listed above, the other characters were either boring, unlikable, or poorly written. I thought Ikkaris was boring, and his twist of being the villain was just kind of thrown into the mixed. I thought Sersi was boring, and she was one of the main characters throughout the film. I could care less about Druig and Gilgamesh, and Ajak is barely in the film. I thought Sprite was annoying, and her helping Ikkaris to wipe out Earth had poor reasoning him, with her just loving him.-The film tries to have lots of emotional moments, like Gilgamesh getting killed, or Sprite wanting to be a normal human. But those moments are all underwhelming because we don't know much about these characters, and their motivations in life
-The film tries to introduced a lot of Mythology into the MCU, and it feels like they're trying to shove so much mythology in, that it just becomes a mess.-The story can feel repetitive, with the story introducing characters, and a deviant fight in the middle of it. It just kind of gets old.In conclusion, while some of the film was pretty good, a lot of it is poorly executed, or badly written. I liked some of the film, but it feels kind of frustrating to talk about.",Eternals

A dull, lifeless, energy pulling mess of a film. As other have said no chemistry, no decent characters a waste of good actors who have a rubbish and talky script to content with, a grey dull look to the film. It was like wathcing a blank screen, you are seeing something in front of you but it is not saying or doing anything, it certainly not moving you in any way, and the repeated failed attempts at humour.

473,0,kosmasp,Old school,9/10,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright seems to polarize with this movie. Although generally speaking the majority seem to love this as much as I did. Or in similar fashion - no pun intended. And for a genre movie it starts off ... well off (weird). You don't get a shocker, quite the opposite it starts off with a music number/dancing. Which makes sense when you think about it in hindsight and still sets a tone for the viewer - even if not one that is as menacing as the movie becomes later on.Technically speaking the movie is impeccable. Anyone arguing differently surely has not seen far lesser movies produced than this and is probably blinded by the fact they don't like the movie. Which is more than fine, just don't let your dislike turn into a general bashing. One does not have to like a movie that is well made. We have different tastes and that is a good thing.There are things that depending on how you view things, may feel like flaws or things the movie did not get right. Like the moral ambiguity or the love interest. The latter may feel a bit one dimensional, but ask yourself this: how many female love interests have been played or rather written the exact same way? So this is nothing unusual - unless you count the gender swap for who is playing the gullible and way too nice person to be real ... having said that, again that may not be enough to sway you to like the movie or the characters.And the moral issues the movie displays including an ending that some may not be entirely left satisfied with (character choices and so much more) - with many unanswered questions ... on the other hand, some things are better left without an answer, so we as viewers can fill in the blanks.Stylish and probably with quite a few in-camera effects (I imagine certain tricks were used to avoid a higher special effects cost, but I may be wrong), this movie has a few exquisite jump scares and a really good story as a backbone. Oh and before I forget, a great cast. It has been ages since I last saw Terence Stamp on the big screen ... Covid aside of course.Anyway, really good genre movie by a director who knows what he wants - for an audience who mostly seems to appreciate it.",Last Night in Soho
474,1,jboothmillard,Last Night in Soho,6/10,14 November 2021,"I saw the trailer for this film a couple of times shortly before its release, it looked intriguing, a different and surprising choice for writer and director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Baby Driver), and one that I couldn't wait to see. Basically, Eloise ""Ellie"" Turner (Leave No Trace's Thomasin McKenzie) loves the music and fashion of the Swinging Sixties and dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Her mother (Aimee Cassettari), also a designer, killed herself when Ellie was a child. Ellie lives with her grandmother Margaret / ""Peggy"" (Rita Tushingham) in Redruth, Cornwall, and occasionally sees her mother's ghost in mirrors. Ellie moves from her rural home to London to study at the London College of Fashion. She struggles to fit in with her peers, particularly her snobbish roommate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen). Only fellow student John (Michael Ajao) is sympathetic to her. Unhappy in the hall of residence, Ellie moves into a bedsit in Goodge Place owned by the elderly Ms Collins (Dame Diana Rigg, in her final role). That night, Ellie has a vivid dream in which she is transported back in time to the 1960s. At the Café de Paris, she sees a confident young blonde woman, Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), who wants to become a singer at the club. Sandie begins a relationship with the smartly dressed and charming manager, Jack (Matt Smith). The next morning, Ellie designs a dress inspired by Sandie. She also finds she has a love bit on the neck, which Sandie received during the dream. Ellie has another dream in which Sandie successfully auditions at a Soho nightclub, arranged by Jack. After which, she returns to the same bedsit that Ellie is renting. Ellie is inspired by these visions, and decides to dye her hair blonde, changes her fashion style, uses Sandie as an inspiration for her dress designs and gets a job at a pub. Following this transformation, she is watched by a silver-haired man (Terence Stamp), who recognises her similarities to Sandie. In the following dreams, Ellie discovers that Sandie is not living the life she had hoped for, Jack begins to pimp her with male business associates. Out of the dream world, Ellie starts to experience monstrous apparitions that resemble Jack and the various men who abused Sandie. She attends a Halloween party but flees when the spirits disturb her there. John returns with her to her bedsit to comfort her, and they begin to make love. But then Ellie is terrified by a vision of Jack murdering Sandie, causing her to panic and John to be thrown out by Ms Collins. Ellie decides to track down the silver-haired man, who she believes is Jack. She goes to the police to report the crime of murder from the past, but she is not taken seriously. Ellie goes to the university library to look through archives for newspaper reports of murders in Soho, but she is unable to find anything about Sandie's murder. Instead, she finds various articles of local men who vanished without a trace. She is surrounded by monstrous spirits and nearly stabs Jocasta in a state of panic. Ellie returns to the pub to find the silver-haired man, believing she must avenge Sandie. The old man denies killing Sandie before running out into the road and being hit by a taxi. The pub landlady Carol (Father Ted's Pauline McLynn) tells Ellie that the man is not Jack, but a retired police officer named Lindsay. Ellie recalls him as an undercover vice officer from her dreams; he tried to help Sandie escape her life of prostitution. Devastated, Ellie decides she should leave London and John drives her back to Ms Collins' house. She informs Ms Collins that she is leaving. Ms Collins makes her a cup of tea and tells her that a detective came by asking about Sandie. Eventually, Ms Collins reveals that she is actually Sandie, revealing that she killed Jack in self-defence after he threatened her with a knife, and she murdered the various men she was pimped to, hiding their bodies underneath floorboards in the house. Ms Collins also reveals she drugged Ellie's tea and will kill her to prevent her telling the truth. In a scuffle, a cigarette is dropped and ignites a box of vinyl records. John comes to Ellie's rescue, but Ms Collins stabs him. Ellie flees to her room while the house is engulfed in flames. The spirits of Sandie's victims surround Ellie, begging her to kill Ms Collins, but she refuses. Ms Collins enters Ellie's room, where she sees the spirits and is slapped by the ghost of Jack. With the police outside, Ms Collins attempts to slit her own throat, but Ellie stops her, saying she understands why she killed the men. Ms Collins, as Sandie, tells Ellie to save herself and John from the fire. Sandie stays in the building as it burns. Sometime later, Ellie enjoys success as her dresses are showcased at a fashion show. She is congratulated backstage by her grandmother and John, now her boyfriend. Ellie sees her mother's spirit in a mirror and then sees Sandie, who waves and blows her a kiss. Also starring Jessie Mei Li as Lara, Kassius Nelson as Cami, Rebecca Harrod as Ashley, Beth Singh as Cilla Black, Margaret Nolan as sage barmaid, Sam Claflin as a young Lindsay, Harry Potter's James and Oliver Phelps as Cloakroom Attendants. McKenzie is terrific as the 1960s obsessed fashion student, Taylor-Joy looks fabulous and is splendid as the wannabe club singer, Smith is great as the charmer with a nasty streak, and the support of Stamp and Rigg are memorable as well. I didn't expect it to be as dark and disturbing as it turned out to be, it is admittedly predictable at times, but the mystery element keeps it going, the scary stuff gets your attention, and the period detail with costume design and its use of vibrant colours is eye-catching, all in all, it is a visually arresting and interesting psychological horror.

475,2,CinemaSerf,"Gently bubbling, sophisticated, horror film...",7/10,7 November 2021,"The time-shift nature of the narrative, supported well by the changes in fashion styling, an excellent soundtrack of strong vocals and a really top-notch effort from Anya Taylor-Joy as ""Sandie"" really make this quite compelling at times. When ""Eloise"" (Thomasin McKenzie) takes an attic room in the house of Dame Diana Rigg, all goes well until she starts to become subsumed into the life of an alter-ego ""Sandie"" - a girl who came to London's Soho in the 1960s, full of pipe dreams to be a successful singer. She alighted on the sleazy ""Jack"" (Matt Smith) who promised her the world - but soon she was just another plaything for old men... Initially convinced these are just dreams, soon ""Eloise"" and her would-be-beau from fashion school ""John"" (Michael Ajao) are trying to get to the bottom of what really happened... As horror films go, it has plenty to keep it interesting. There are a few jump moments as the film progresses, but mostly it is the hugely creative style of the visuals that build the sense of menace. The twin-dimensional aspects of the plot gradually marrying together as their two environments begin to encroach more on each other. I can't say I liked the ending, it was all just a bit too convenient and for me, at any rate, predictable. The interventions from Terence Stamp were unnecessarily misleading, I felt - and not in an interestingly red-herring sort of fashion, which I thought was a little bit of a shame. Still, though, this is a great looking, well paced and engaging test for the nerves that showcased some good acting talent that I did rather enjoy.",Last Night in Soho

477,4,ferguson-6,where the neon signs are pretty,8/10,29 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every once in a while a movie captures that magic feeling of being swept away, and this wild film from writer-director Edgar Wright and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns (1917) did just that for me. This is my kind of psychological-horror-thriller and with the exception of one sequence that went a bit too ""slasher"" for my tastes, I had a blast watching it. I'll admit that, while also acknowledging more people will probably not enjoy this, than will. But for those who do, I feel confident they will share my enthusiasm.Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie, JOJO RABBIT, 2019) opens the film by expressively dancing to Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" while sporting a self-designed dress made of perfectly creased newspaper. Her room is filled with 1960's colors and memorabilia and we soon learn she's an orphan raised by her grandmother (Rita Tushingham, A TASTE OF HONEY, 1961). Eloise, or Ellie as she's called, dreams of following her mother's path to London, and is thrilled beyond measure when her acceptance letter arrives from the London School of Fashion. Ellie does carry the burden (and visions) of her mother's mental illness, and her grandmother warns, ""London can be a lot.""
Small town (Cornwall) Ellie with her timidity and wide-eyed innocence arrives in London and is immediately the target of 'mean girl' and fellow student Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen). Rather than subject herself to the abuse, Ellie sublets an attic room from an old lady landlord named Mrs. Collins (the last screen appearance for the great Diana Rigg). Ellie loves the room and her independence, but her dreams act as a portal back to those swinging 60's of which she's so fond. But that's only the beginning. It's here where she follows/becomes Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), and the mirror effects are truly other-worldly. Sandie is everything that Ellie wishes she was herself - confident, radiant, ambitious, and beautiful. This dream state allows Ellie to live vicariously through Sandie. At least initially.The Ellie-Sandie sequences mess with your head in a wonderful way. Sandie seems to float across the club's dance floor, and Ellie is mesmerized at first, before turning protective. The tone shifts when Sandie meets sleazy Jack (Matt Smith), a would-be agent who promises to get Sandie the shot at stardom she desires. This leads to ATJ's amazing and breathy version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown"". It's a standalone highlight of the film, and a moment that shifts the story yet again. If you are struggling to keep pace, you're not alone.Soho's glamour is matched only by its grunge. The recurring dreams turn to nightmares, so that even Ellie's waking hours are surreal. A mysterious elderly gent played by Terence Stamp may be the key to the mystery Ellie's so busy trying to solve that she is oblivious to the romantic overtures by nice guy John (Michael Ajao). The nostalgia of the 60's provides a visual treat with the Café de Paris, a massive theater marquee advertising James Bond's THUNDERBALL, and Cilla Black's ""You're My World"".Filmmaker Wright gives us so much to discuss, but it's crucial that the best parts not be spoiled. Just know that Oscar winner Steven Price (GRAVITY, 2013) provides an incredible mix of music, while Chung-Hoon Chung's cinematography, Marcus Rowland's Production Design, and Odile Dicks-Mireaux's costumes all nearly steal the show. But of course, that can't possibly happen thanks to the stupendous performances from Anya Taylor-Joy and (especially) Thomasin McKenzie. These are two of the finest young actors working today, and we will be fortunate to watch their careers develop.Edgar Wright is having quite a year. He's already delivered the terrific documentary, THE SPARKS BROTHERS, and now comes what is his best work yet. You may know his work on BABY DRIVER (2017) or the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy that kicked off with SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004). Here, he playfully bounces between genres serving up time travel, a murder mystery, the Soho history, a memorable soundtrack, surreal dream and ghost sequences, a touch of romance, and that previously mentioned 'slasher' scene. A final tip of the cap to Diana Rigg, whose career spanned her role as Emma Peel in ""The Avengers"" (from the 60's), her time as a Bond girl in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969), and ultimately as Olenna Tyrell in ""Game of Thrones"".Opens in theaters on October 29, 2021.",Last Night in Soho
478,5,blanbrn,"A ghost haunting of the past, a little bit of reincarnation or living another life with twist!",6/10,31 October 2021,"Director Edgar Wright has made one interesting and tense glamour like suspense thriller horror like drama in ""Last Night in Soho"". Maybe he took from a page of old classic horror and he really blended the film well with 60's culture of clothes, music and hair styles. The acting and chemistry between the two leads Anya Taylor Joy and Thomasin Mckenzie is in top form.The story and setting is with Eloise a girl who's lost her mother and she is being raised by grandma and she's accepted to a fashion design school in London. So it's off to the big bright lights and city streets and she does not fit in the click with the current class of girls. So she rents an apartment and her landlady just doesn't seem right. Soon Eloise starts having strange dreams seeing a past time in nightclubs of the 60's seeing a lounge singer Sandie(Anya Taylor Joy) and she soon sees strange characters and a dark past. Many of these sightings and dreams lead to ghostly encounters. What is this picture trying to say is it to reveal a murder mystery or is it saying reincarnation or did Eloise live a past life. Only the film twist and reveals something about the past, murders, and trio of characters of Eloise, Sandie, and the old woman the renting landlady of Eloise's. May not be the best work still it's entertains and blends well with 60's times of fashion, and music as this is a mix of drama, horror, and suspense.",Last Night in Soho

480,7,Lejink,Soho It Goes,8/10,21 November 2021,"A little late for Halloween, my wife asked me to find us ""a good horror"" to watch for a Saturday night and so we happened on Edgar Wright's new release.An unusual combination of seeming time-travel and fantasy-horror, with a super-swinging 60's soundtrack, this is obviously Wright's homage to great British directors like Hitchcock, Powell, Roëg and whoever directed all those cheap, lurid Hammer horror films of the 60's. He employs iconic actors of the era like the late Dame Diana Rigg, in her last movie role, Rita Tushingham and Terence Stamp, who suitably emerges to the backdrop of Ray Davies' brilliant era-defining song ""Waterloo Sunset"" which name-checks him (pity Julie Christie didn't turn up to meet him though!) using their recognisable star-appeal combined with excellent set-design to recreate London in its mid-60's heyday. I loved the shot where Thomasin McKenzie steps into her bygone dream sequence as she looks up at a massive, vintage Bond movie poster above a contemporary picture-house.The plot is a bit far-fetched as we follow young fashion-designer super-sensitive McKenzie's Eloise (cue Barry Ryan's mighty song of the same name!) on her odyssey to London to attend college and try to break into the big city scene. She has a connection to her deceased mother, a 60's free-spirit who we're told killed herself but whose shade still follows Ellie (not Eloise!) around, in almost guardian angel fashion. This explains her 60's fixation not only in her clothes' sense but in her constant playing of 60's pop.While she struggles to fit in with her obnoxious college flatmates, she meets up with a sympathetic young black fellow-student and ends up in a dingy bedsit offered by crusty old female landlord, played by Rigg. However, there's something about the ambience of the room which affects the young girl's psyche as she enters into troubled, technicolour dreams which take her back to Swinging 60's London as the alter-ego of an ambitious blonde girl-singer, Sandie (note Shaw-like spelling) played by Anya Taylor-Joy. Soon Ellie's head is fit to burst as she shadows Sandie's dark journey through the seedy London underworld in the company of her spivvy manager Matt Smith, while everywhere she turns she seems to bump into Stamp's mysterious old gentleman. And just who are all those zombie-like presences which pursue Ellie from pillar-to-post even as she tries to keep up with Sandie's descent in a scene reminiscent of ""Don't Look Now""...?With twists and turns a-plenty, the film kept us on the hop throughout even as we sang along to classic British hits of the time, in particular by British chanteuses Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw, although quite why a track by 80's post-punk band Souixie and the Banshees was included, I don't know.I enjoyed the wise, knowing performances by Rigg, Stamp and Tushingham, all of whom enter fully into the spirit of the piece, although it would have been nice to see them share a scene together, while McKenzie and Taylor-Joy both shine as twin-leads, even if the latter was presumably already familiar with the night-time presences on her bedroom ceiling from her previous experience in ""The Queen's Gambit"".An enjoyable apotheosis of many of director Wright's previous tropes, this twisted, throwback Gothic thriller went down very well with us, I must say.",Last Night in Soho
481,8,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Striking, original horror fantasy from Edgar Wright",9/10,2 November 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEloise (Thomasin McKenzie) travels up from her home in Cornwall to London, to study fashion design. Obsessed with the 60's and wearing clothes she made herself, the introverted young woman becomes a target of rejection and ridicule by her new dorm mates, and isn't accepted by anybody except John (Michael Ajao), a fellow student. She finds herself a flat, rented out by the forthright Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg) where at night she is transported by forces unknown back to the 60's, where she enters the body of Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), a feisty aspiring singer, who is rescued one night by the seemingly friendly Jack (Matt Smith), who, after showing his true colours, plunges Eloise into a devastating, sinister nightmare.The 1960's could be said to be the first era to have an enduring timelessness about it. A time of sexual liberation and changing social attitudes, it was the first great 'rock n' roll' decade, with fashion and music that set the trends from then on, and a time ripe with potential to set stories against the backdrop to, such as this increasingly dark, unnerving tale from director Edgar Wright.It speaks to the enduring appeal of the 60's that the central protagonist was born so long after it, but still has such an obsession with it. From the outset, Eloise is clearly marked as a passive misfit, living in her own little world, dancing around in her room at home, making her the perfect fish out of water when she gets from her home in Cornwall to the big smoke that is London. The colourful visual assault when she first steps into the night out in 60's Soho, most notably the brightly lit poster advertising the new James Bond film Thunderball, is one of the film's deftest touches, along with the dazzling soundtrack, featuring the likes of Cilla Black and Petula Clark, that really bring the period setting to life. The central concept, while at first a little far fetched, does have a successful air of intrigue about it that draws you in and keeps you hooked.It all builds up to a big twist, the big reveal behind everything that's been going on, which takes a detour from the Sixth Sense style path it was going down to a different route, which despite having a certain predictability to it, still manages to come off in a way you weren't completely expecting. Mainly, it's kudos to Wright and a sparkling cast for pulling off an original and striking feature so gorgeously. ****",Last Night in Soho

Thomasin McKenzie has extraordinary eyes, although the 17 pounds of eye makeup helps a bit. 3. One of the Commandments of Film-making is never ever produce an opening segment which is better than the rest of the movie. Oops.

Not once did I look at a watch to see what time it is. It was very enthralling. I like psychological horror movies. Acting was very good. No need to write name each one individually. They were all great. The atmosphere, costumes, hair, make-up designs and music of the movie were very good.I think there are two twists in the movie. I had guessed 1, but one had never occurred to me. I also liked the twist and ending of the movie. Overall, it's a great job, I recommend it to be seen in the cinema.

484,11,The-Sarkologist,A New Direction for Wright,9/10,21 November 2021,"In one sense this film is absolutely nothing like what you would have expected from Edgar Wright, but he does seem to be expanding his style of film making of late. In fact, his previous film was a documentary about a lesser known musical duet. However, this film is basically a psychological horror, and it is definitely not outlandish like many of his other films. It also explores elements of what Central London, especially it's Soho district, was like back in the 60s, particularly with young ladies who traveled to the city in an attempt to make it into show business.The story is about a young lady who lives in Cornwall and has been accepted into the London School of fashion. She also has visions of her dead mother in the mirror (and mirrors play an important role in this film). Not surprisingly she struggles in the first couple of days, suddenly experiencing the party lifestyle of the people who she is sharing a dormitory with, so she moves into an apartment where she begins to have visions of the woman named Sandie from the 1960s.At first is seems as if Sandie is living the dream, until she suddenly discovers that the role of the entertainer that she believes that she has been brought into is actually a front for a prostitution ring, and that she has been caught up in it without a way of being able to escape. What at first seems to be inspiration for Ellie (she designs a dress based upon the dress that Sandie is wearing when she first appears) suddenly becomes a horror story when she realises that Sandie is actually a prisoner of the patriarchal Soho society of the 60s. Behind all of the glitz and glamour is a very dark world that many people don't ever see.As I mentioned, mirrors play a very important role in the film, and are used to show how the characters are interacting across time. Mind you, while Ellie seems to be playing the role of the observer, while she is able to witness what is going on, Sandie is unaware that she is being watched. For instance, whenever Ellie's mother appears it is in a mirror, and while Sandie and Ellie switch places at times, it is only because Ellie is experiencing Sandie's torture. Further, whenever Sandie walks past a mirror, you will see Ellie in the reflection, though sometimes the images will be reversed. Sandie doesn't see Ellie in the mirror, but when Ellie looks into the mirror, Sandie will be looking back at her.In a way the mirrors also reflect the distinction between dreams and nightmares. At first when Ellie goes to sleep she is dreaming, and the dream reflects this new world, and the new experience, but it quickly turns into a nightmare when the manager turns out to be a pimp, and the world of entertainment is much more than just signing on stage. In fact, when the dream turns into a nightmare, Ellie is actually sitting in the audience watching, and this seems to be the only time where Ellie exists in the dream world when she isn't actually following Sandie in her body. The other thing is that when the world turns into a nightmare, this is when she starts to be haunted by the ghosts.I don't want to reveal any more because this is a pretty good film, and it really does explore the nature of exploitation, as well as the dark underworld that exists behind the glitz and glamour of the Soho nightlife. Ellie is a innocent woman in the same way that Sandie is an innocent woman, but the thing is that she begins to see a world that has been hidden from view, and in part it sounds as if she is on the trail of a murder that occurred years earlier. Mind you, there is another subtle hint as well, with the advertisement for James Bond's Thunderball, which on the outside seems as if it is just a glitzy film, but in reality there is a dark undertone to it, not so much because it is a spy thriller, but more because of the treatment of women in that film, and at the time. For those who understand the film, this is a significant hint as to what is about to happen.",Last Night in Soho
485,12,UniqueParticle,"""When we're alone we go downtown"" I absolutely loved this movie!",10/10,29 October 2021,"Thomsen McKenzie and Anya Taylor Joy are exquisite! Last Night at Soho is brilliant, has one of the best soundtracks ever, and really well made by genius Edgar Wright. I loved the story so much about a girl that wants to be a designer and famous that starts experiencing something very different that I won't spoil anything everything with Alexandria (Anya) is so good. I was very surprised of the old folks that came to the movie, I guess they didn't mind the horror. Very deserving of the 7.6 rating and I'll definitely want to buy when available.

486,13,cruise01,Stylish and a love letter to 60s with a ghostly supernatural story.,7/10,31 October 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Pros: Edgar Wrights stylish direction is entertaining. Its a psychological horror film that is about a girl moving to Soho. When visiting a rental room. She has visions of the 60s in Sandys perspective (Ana Taylor Joy).The film has a great soundtrack that works great with the film.It does have a few thrills that will keep you on the edge.Thomasin Mckenzie and Ana Taylor Joy did a great job with there characters.Cons: the plot becomes forgettable once everything comes together. Like any other ordinary supernatural thriller. A girl with a gift that can see visions of the dead and what happened in the past. Which someone was murdered. And she is trying to solve that mystery.The climax becomes dull once the twist is revealed which was not surprising or shocking. Which thw third act becomes weak compared to the rest of the film.,Last Night in Soho
487,14,zkonedog,A Supremely Entertaining Sensory Feast In Nearly Every Aspect,9/10,9 November 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" is not a perfect film, to be sure. Some of the decisions it makes regarding plot and characters could very easily be considered suspect or sub-standard (especially in the oft-criticized third act). But in a larger sense, the movie is so extremely entertaining that such potential faults can largely be forgiven (even by plot/character fanatics like myself) in lieu of everything else director Edgar Wright brings to the table.For a very basic overview, ""Last Night in Soho"" tells the story of Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), a young adult from the English countryside who moves to the present-day big city to study fashion design. Elosie doesn't fit in with the traditional ""mean girl"" types, instead obsessed with the 1960s England aesthetic. She also possesses (as visions of her late mother establish) a sort of ""second sight"" that--while sleeping--transports her directly into the swinging London '60s body of Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). What Eloise & Sandie simultaneously discover is a culture that preys on young women--potentially to dire consequences unless an intervention occurs.The biggest calling card of ""Last Night in Soho"" is that it's a visual and auditory feast of the highest order. The soundtrack sets every mood perfectly, and the visuals are colorful/flashy without ever being distracting or over-the-top. Truly one of the most impressive immersions into a film atmosphere I've ever experienced.The acting is also top-notch. Taylor-Joy (steadily climbing the ranks of most in-demand Hollywood actresses) is spot-on as both sexy/demure and vulnerable, while McKenzie brings an earnestness and relatable nature to the mysterious proceedings. Those two leads are then surrounded by perfectly-cast, old-school English stars like Diana Rigg & Terence Stamp.Plot-wise, the first half of the film is all about ""setting the mood"", and does so to near-perfection. It concocts a fairly standard mystery to go along with the glitz and glamour--and then turns it on its head in the final minutes, moving the proceedings towards thriller/horror. From a critical perspective, there may be some doubt as to the technical effectiveness of such a choice. But to be honest, by that point I was so engaged that I didn't feel let down in the slightest.I'd have to watch ""Last Night in Soho"" again to better gauge the ending tonality shift. But my initial reaction upon leaving the theater was that I was thoroughly entertained in nearly every aspect. This was an all-sensory stimulation like few others I've ever seen.",Last Night in Soho
488,15,eddie_baggins,A beautifully shot film that can't reach the narrative goals it sets for itself,6/10,19 November 2021,"His conquered the living dead with nothing more than unwanted vinyl records, alien invaders in small country towns and even managed to wrangle baby drivers but there's no doubt Last Night in Soho is beloved British director and critical darling Edgar Wright's most ambitious film yet and a film that doesn't always reach the lofty goals it sets for itself even if its a beautifully shot and unique thriller mixed with horror elements.His first film narrative feature film since Baby Driver in 2017, Soho is undoubtedly a labor of love for Wright who produces his most un-Wright feeling film yet, that follows Thomasin McKenzie's country girl fashion designer to London, where her rental of a small bedroom apartment leads her to experience vivid and increasingly frightening visions into the life of a seemingly real London resident of the 60's named Sandie (a mesmerizing Anya Taylor-Joy) creating a very late 60's/70's feeling feature that struggles to keep itself on the rails as the runtime wears on.Magnificently capturing the time and place of the London era of the setting with help from Old Boy and Handmaiden cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung (delivering Oscar worthy work) and some eclectic and toe tapping concoction of classic tunes from the era that once more suggests Wright is right up there with Quentin Tarantino when it comes to sound-tracking his films and particular scenes, Soho has a lot to admire and for its first 30 to 40 minutes things rollick along at a great pace with a lot of intrigue in what's happening and what's around the corner but the film does get into a mid to late section funk that becomes both repetitive and a little too much to handle narrative wise.You can see what Wright was trying too do and how he wanted his film to evolve but that doesn't excuse the loop we end up getting stuck in and the sometimes questionable choices that Eloise makes (with some added overacting by a trying hard but not always hitting the mark McKenzie) and while visually and atheistically everything is always of a very high standard, there's a coldness to the story of Soho and it never quite works as well as you'd like as a mystery or a fully fledged horror that it at times appears to be wanting to be.In amongst all of the narrative let downs and feeling that it never quite hits the marks it sets for itself is the continued great work of Taylor-Joy whose growing into one of the most interesting actors working today, a fairly chilling performance from the usually likable Matt Smith and a central plot that at the very least doesn't play things out in the usual schtick, making Soho far from a complete misfire but nothing more than an intriguing could've been film that I am sure Wright and his fanbase will look back on in days to come as a missed opportunity to create something spectacular.Final Say -A film that sets itself a tricky task its never fully able to handle, Last Night in Soho is a high quality feature that can't ever quite juggle its various elements into a final product that feels worthy of its goals.3 Vesper's out of 5.",Last Night in Soho
489,16,paul-allaer,Stylish British horror-drama oozes with fabulous song placements,7/10,29 October 2021,"As ""Last Night in Soho"" (2021 release from the UK; 118 min.) opens, we are introduced to Eloise (a/k/a Ellie). Ellie learns she's been accepted at the London College of Fashion, and off she goes to London. She ends up renting a room on the top floor of an old house owned by an old lady. With stars in her eyes, Ellie falls asleep and when she wakes up, she's in Swingin' London with the new James Bond, Thunderball, playing in theaters... Is she dreaming? Or has she been transported back in time? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Edgar Wright, who just earlier this year brought us the fantastic ""Sparks Brothers"" documentary, but he is better known for films like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Baby Driver"". Here he dives back into London of the mid-60s, a/k/a Swingin' London. Was it all that good? Or do we have a selective memory? Around that Wright builds a plot-heavy story with a horror undercurrent, and that's all I will say about it. The first hour of the movie is fabulous. The second hour not nearly as much. Still it is quite enjoyable, with several strong lead performances, none more so than Thomasin McKenzie (as Ellie), but look out as well for Anya Taylor-Joy as Sandie, and Diana Rigg (in her last film role, and the movie is dedicated to her) as the old landlady. But perhaps the biggest fun comes from the many, many song placements that are peppered throughout the film, starting with Peter & Gordon's ""A World Without Love"" in the film's opening sequence, James Ray's ""I've Got My Mind Set On You"" (alter a hit for George Harrison), and all the way through the very end, when the title song comes from Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich in the movie's last scene, followed by Steven Price's ""Neon"" playing over the end credits. Just fantastic all around and I will be sure to check out the movie's soundtrack.""Last Night in Soho"" was filmed in the first half of 2019, yes 2 1/2 years ago, and was scheduled for release in 2020. Then a little thing called COVID-10 had other ideas (and almost killed the movie theatre business). The film FINALLY opened in theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening showing where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was not attended well (exactly 2 people including myself). If you are in the mood for a stylish horror-drama that oozes with fabulous song placements and has several strong lead performances, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), or eventually on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Last Night in Soho

Disappointment has followed disappointment, until finally 'Last Night in Soho' came along and broke the trend. I've been waiting a long time for this film and my expectations were high, but thankfully it was able to live up to them.The style in this film is abundant. As soon as the 1960's section of the film begins it finds its groove and never looks back. The cinematography is incredible. How they filmed some of those sequences (apparently done practically, with minimal use of special effects) is beyond me. It looked incredible.This is one of those plots where you don't actually know what you're looking at until it hits you. If you find yourself a little dismayed by the plot at any point I would implore you to stick with it. The ending of this film is brilliant and is going to blow people away. Finally I have to give a shoutout to New Zealand actress Thomasin McKenzie who was incredible in this. She played her role perfectly and never missed a beat.

This movie had so much potential with a great premise and set-up, fantastic flashback sequences, a great cast and remarkable use of lighting, color and cinematography. The acting is also pretty good, though I'd say McKenzie's performance was a bit uneven, especially towards the end of the movie. This film after a good set-up falls apart and spins out of control to a messy and unorganized conclusion that gets painful to watch at times. The horror elements also don't align well with the premise and could have been executed so much better...I didn't love the use of CGI, especially when you discover the true plot and think back on where and when the horror elements took place. This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie. I'd score this a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping it.",Last Night in Soho
492,19,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Last Night in Soho,7/10,31 October 2021,"7/10 - I respect what Edgar Wright and his team were trying to do with this, but I could not help but feel that this story would have been far better served if it were less focused on traditional horror elements and more of a straightforward mystery with flashbacks.

The gimmick is a girl has dreams about the 1960's and can travel there in her dreams. Thomasin plays the aspiring fashion designer that has the visions/dreams. When she comes to London to pursue her career, she has dreams of Anya, an aspiring singer in the 1960's London Soho area. Matt plays the man that gives Anya a job in a club, but soon things turn dark for Anya. When Thomasin sees what is going on, she tries to help Anya-they inhabit the same body when Thomasin goes into the dream/past-and things get complicated when Thomasin meets Terence, whom she thinks is Matt in the present. Diana plays the landlady where Thomasin is staying in London. There is a lot of 60's music, a nice plot twist and Diana Rigg's last role-the film is dedicated to Diana.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language, drug use and sexual situations-a little nudity-has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I would probably buy this one on DVD.",Last Night in Soho

Oddly it works rather well and seems destined for cult status. The 2 leads, particularly McKenzie do very well, and the supporting cast is also on top form with a special mention for Diana Rigg - whose last screen performance this was - who is terrific. The soundtrack featuring Cilla Black, Petula Clark etc is great and the only reservation I have is that there could have been a little more tightening up on the fantasy scenes which do roll on a little in the middle section.

Soon after, she finds herself having vivid dreams in which she experiences (and witnesses) the life of an aspiring singer, Sandie, who resided in the same room some fifty years prior. However, these dreams soon take a dark turn.This genre offering from Edgar Wright is a love letter to numerous horror films of the sixties, bearing shades of ""Repulsion"" and ""Persona"" alongside Italian gialli and outright supernatural horror. On a merely visual level, the film is a mind-bending odyssey through two women's lives in two starkly different time periods, drenched in neon lights. The cinematography is stunning, and there are numerous impressive optical effects (many of which appear practically done) in which Eloise appears as Sandie's mirrored double, witnessing/experiencing moments from her life as an observer who melts into the background. These are wonderfully orchestrated and a pure joy to watch.The performances here are uniformly strong, with Thomasin McKenzie leading as the quiet, nostalgic Eloise, and Anya Taylor-Joy playing the tragic swinging sixties counterpart. British veterans Terence Stamp and the late Diana Rigg have integral supporting roles here and are both effective in their parts. The only real complaint I have about the film is that, despite successfully blending its original ideas with classic genre elements, it does seem to sag a bit in the middle section, as the increasingly disturbing visions take on a hyper-supernatural nature that wears thin. Despite a few hokey sequences in the latter half, the film redeems itself with two unexpected plot twists that are legitimate surprises.Overall, ""Last Night in Soho"" is an audacious psychological horror effort that, despite some repetitiousness in its midsection, still stands up as a stylish film that sticks to the terms of its vision for better or for worse. When you think it's run out of tricks, it manages to throw enough curveballs in the finale to redeem itself. As far as over-the-top, garish horror goes, ""Last Night in Soho"" is one of the better contemporary efforts with a director and cast who remain fully committed to the material. 7/10.",Last Night in Soho

Ellie (Thomasin McKenzie) moves from Cornwall to London to study fashion design, she doesn't get on with her room mate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen) and other female students who are basically Heathers. She gets a bedsit, her landlady is the aged Mrs Collins Diana Rigg). She soon slips back to 1965 where she becomes Sandy (Anya Taylor-Joy), who lived in the same flat. At first she see's herself as Sandy in mirrors, but she delays as Sandy moves on, she is a witness to Sandy's actions but then she switches back and forth, Sandy/Ellie dancing with the same person. Sandy is intent on becoming a singer but is naive and is tricked into believing that Jack (Matt Smith) manages singers. Her early love for him fades as he becomes her pimp. The world of 1960s London becomes all too real for Ellie as she brings back physical marks and it affects her studies as she seems to hallucinate. Ellie dyes her hair and dresses like Sandy. This is very much a horror film but most of that detail cannot be revealed without spoiling the film. Suffice to say that there are a few jump shocks and grey men act like Zombies in the most effective scenes. Much of the horror is psychological as a feeling of dread builds as the narrative unfolds. Terence Stamp plays Lindsay an enigmatic older man in the present day who seems to recognise Ellie after she changes her appearance. A story of abuse, exploitation and revenge with a few interesting plot turns. Great acting by McKenzie, Taylor-Joy, Diana Rigg (her final performance) and Stamp.

499,26,jfgibson73,"""Still the same old London underneath""",8/10,21 November 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's got some horror elements with a mystery going through it, but I don't think most genre fans will find it scary or even disturbing. What it has going for it is a fairly original story, lots of style, and some great performances. They have done an unbelievable job of recreating a bygone era, with fashions, colors, and music expertly utilized. Thomasin McKenzie makes an ideal protagonist to take us through the dark journey into the past, which contrasts with her ideas of what it was like back then. But the star power wattage is off the charts whenever Anya Taylor-Joy appears. She's turned in some great performances up until now, but this takes her to another level. I also give the film big points for being one that I can enjoy watching over again, which is pretty rare for something meant to be scary. I don't agree with reviewers who say the movie ""fails to come together,"" or that the third act doesn't meet the expectations set up early on. I can understand not feeling quite right about where everything ends up, but I personally don't criticize a story for not doing exactly what I would have wanted it to.

Evoking a particular time, place & genre we follow the travels of a young girl from the sticks, played by Thomasin McKenzie, from Jo Jo Rabbit, heading to London to start her collegiate career at a fashion school. Proudly wearing outfits she's made, she's clearly marked as the one to ridicule as the mean girls descend on her but focused on her own studies & making good on promises to her doting grandmother, played by 60's it Girl Rita Tushingham & her deceased mother. Hoping to stay away from the nonsense, she finds a room off the beaten path run by a stalwart, hard woman, played by the late, great Diana Rigg, who warns her that she needs a couple of months of security up front (due to past experiences of renters bolting in the night) & no male visitors past a certain time which McKenzie accepts but after a few nights there she begins to have vivid dreams of the 60's seen through the eyes of another woman, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is trying to make it as a singer, only making headway when she meets a club Lothario, played by Dr. Who's Matt Smith, who promises her the moon but the reality is she becomes part of a high end brothel w/the most undesirable clientele. McKenzie becomes increasingly unhinged as the realization sets in Joy was murdered (she even goes to the cops & enlists a friendly face, played by Michael Ajao, to help research victims from that time period to track down the murderer (who McKenzie initially suspects to be Smith now in the present day, now played by another icon of British cinema, Terence Stamp). Through it all we get gushes of blood & anguished cries from the past along w/a plethora of 60's needle drops (a lot of which I didn't recognize which I was delighted with), looks & settings which thoroughly put the modern viewer into days of cinema past (I saw some Peeping Tom & Blow Out as nods) showing that Wright knows what he directs (much like other cinephiles like Quentin Tarantino or Paul W. Anderson).",Last Night in Soho

502,29,rgkarim,I Had SoHo Much Fun With This Film,8/10,29 October 2021,"LIKES:The Style:
Like the poster and trailers, this film was hinted at being a stylish take on the horror genre, and it delivers this in so many ways. Wright leads a wonderful charge into two different time periods of London and make them look so dang fun and stylish to live in. There is energy from two different periods cascading into one story, pulling you into the story of this little play, working you into the life of our main character Ellie. Setting wise, it's an engaging piece that is realistic, dynamic, and engaging to the tale, with almost every place used well int eh story.The Presentation:
The premise as you can see in the trailer is that Ellie is drawn into the past to see and experience the life of Sandy. While this may not be the most unique story we've seen, Wright's style is super intriguing in the transitions, especially in the beginning with how she wound up in the world. The fun aspects of life we see involve some fun use of mirrors and switching perspectives to really get you into the feel, only to then drop us back into the real world moments later. Sandy's impact on Ellie is then later explored and seeing the effects were super fun, and even more so how the later aspects of Sandy's life really start to spring on Ellie. These moments are placed well, and each scene has a life of its own, but yet is integrated into the whole picture to never fell too tangential or overwhelming form how smooth the piece was. I was very surprised by these transitions, and how well used they were given the potential to overdo the gimmick.The Acting:
It's good, a fantastic display of quality acting in the genre where many just kind of bring their B and C game in most movies. Soho's group is strong across multiple fronts, and given the direction, character development, and chemistry was able to bring both worlds to life for me. Thomasin McKenzie is a wonderful lead, innocent and naïve, but holding much beneath the meek mannered persona she starts out with. As the movie continues on, she is pulled into other elements that require drastically going through the spectrum of emotions and bringing the terror out in this role. Anya Taylor-Joy is not quite as vocal or dynamic as McKenzie's role, but dang does she play the past role extraordinarily well in what she was told to do. I can't reveal much, but let's just say that she has a combination of confidence, sex appeal, and artistic presentation to bring the emotions of the 60s era to life. She bounces well in the scenes shared with McKenzie, and the looks she gives speak volumes over the dialogue that other characters were given in this film. Matt Smith has the looks of his counterparts super well, executing the cocky arrogance of the times to an artful degree, and adding the dramatic flair that ties things well together. His looks in the suits, alongside the nonverbal acting, speak volumes and establish the atmosphere he holds, and I can't deny that he elevated a lot of scenes in the beginning to drive the pace and story.The Pace:
A movie like this can be slow given all they try to do, but Soho did not feel long to me at all. Because of the ever changing nature of the film, the smoother transitions, and continued evolution of the mystery continued to move to the end. With little tangential detours and not trying to force messages and politics in my face, Soho managed to keep us on the story and lives of the character helping to move the film to its conclusion with steady steps.The Characters:
So nice to find a horror movie where the characters are much deeper than the usual fodder we get. Like the acting, the characters have a lot of layers and quirks to deal with, never being perfect or overpowered, but rather strong and persistent to overcoming their problems. McKenzie's journey was relevant to me on several elements, and I loved the approaches she took to figure out a lot of the happenings in the two ""worlds."" This is true for so many of the characters, many of which are used well to progress the story and actually not just be there to be an overdramatized statement. This is definitely true with the character John, who has a lot of great moments in the film without stealing the show the show away from the group. It was great planning and attention to detail that this genre needed very much for me, and I was happy that Soho delivered this.The Music:
Those who like the classics and appreciate the use of music should really enjoy the styles of this film and how much the music moves the scene. What is used for a character development in one scene, suddenly gets turned into a jaunty number of fun and 60s dazzle before dropping into a simple montage piece to express the emotions of Ellie. Other sequences have the setting amplified to wonderful levels, sometimes being creepier than the visual elements presented. And do not worry, Soho has a combination of modern vibes and big band fun to get you into the moment and I had a blast with it.The Story/Genre:
Again, the story is not the most unique or artistic thing I've seen, but what surprises me is how many genres were crammed into this movie. Soho is not simply a horror/thriller as the categories painted, but instead manages to add layers of other components into film to mix things up and help it stand out from most other films in these categories. There are elements of a comedy that work in just seeing Ellie experience life in London, but then drama comes in to help complicate matters and add a realistic portrayal that is not buried in cheesy scares. The drama further elevates in a different manner at parts of the movie, and soon a mystery starts to develop that soon starts to fold into something else. Crime and Thriller elements start to resonate even further, and soon the horror creeps in only for the other elements to peak back in and allow the other genres to rest. You would think it would be convoluted, but instead it's balanced and meshes well to make a twist on life that again is fun to watch and again interesting to solve all the deceptions hiding in the two worlds.DISLIKES:Character Utilization:
While there are many characters used right, there are others that held more potential and sadly were cut from the final number. The past selves of a couple of the older characters held some potential to add to the mystery, but I can understand the reasons for their limited use. It's the mean girls that plague Emmie's life and I would have loved to see them integrated a little more in the push to get Emmie to continue diving into the world of the 60s London. It's a small complaint, and there are others I'd have liked to foster relationships with, but the stronger relationships work well for me.The Seedier Moments:
You can guess that Soho's neon lights are going to offer many a thrilling dazzle, and some of those moments are going to be portrayed to big details. While I don't suffer from this type of PTSD, I caution those who are sensitive to take heed at the detailed moments of abuse that will be present in this movie. I'm not big on these moments, and fortunately they are lighter, but it only takes one memorable scene to scar your mind so caution.The Violent Moments:
I can't say I really hated these moments, but a couple of the times that got intense crossed the border into savage territory. Again caution to the squeamish and the sensitive to noises because these moments are very loud and sort of hurt my ears as the chaos unfolded. Again, it's a minor dislike, but still one to watch for, alongside the flashing lights if prone to seizures/migraines from this aura.The Ending To A Degree:
When things finally come together, the ending act starts to fall and unravel, with the horror element sort of fizzing out for the dramatic part. I did not hate the ending at all, but after all the buildup, I feel the climactic moment took a direction I was hoping it wouldn't and gotten the true finish worthy of putting everything to a close It's got some symbolic finale with it, a nice job towards the style and character development, but it sort of trips at the end to stumble across the line. And yes, there is some predictability to it, which does lay the foundation for figuring out what will happen in that final moment. And even more so, the special connection Ellie has is left rather unexplained and convenient, and I would have liked that shock factor to have been that connection.The Verdict:
Soho was a stylish surprise for me, that tied back to the classic elements of the horror element and blends multiple genres to make an engaging story. With fun characters, intriguing premises, some realistic lifestyles, and two worlds to balance, Wright brings us a layered tale that should grab a lot of the attention for multiple audiences. Acting continues to shine and some of the characters allow our actors to spread their wings and take thing to deeper levels than the usual thriller/horror cast. A great moving piece with lots of visual and audio components to enjoy Soho has much to check out. True, the character utilization does require some work and tweaking, and there are some intense moments that could hit sensitive viewers, but the main weakness for me is the tripping of the final act to not deliver the full potential that was building up to it. Still, I had fun with this movie and encourage you to check it out if you get the chance in theaters.My scores are:
Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5.",Last Night in Soho
503,30,vengeance20,Mediocre,5/10,4 November 2021,"So it's been 4 years since Edgar Wright last made a film since the hit 2017 film, Baby Driver & now finally, after a year of being pushed back we get this film!The film follows a young girl Eloise, who goes off to London to study fashion design at university. But when she moves into a flat temporarily for somewhere to stay, she starts to have dream/visions of a young girl in the 1960's who seems to be having the time of her life until she is brutally murdered. It is then Eloise starts to be attacked by apparitions& ghosts as she tries to unravel the mystery surrounding this young girl & the room she's staying in.I found the film to be interesting, I didn't much into what the story was about despite seeing previews, so I sort of walked into this one blind, but knew it was a horror so that's why I went to see it (obviously). I was actually lead to believe this film was set in the 60's until 5 minutes in roughly. The story keeps you wondering as the film progresses & it's then you start to understand what's going on, but the dream sequences do drag somewhat & the hallucination scenes (while great the first time around) do get pretty annoying after a while.The characters were pretty flat & the female lead lacked charisma & believability. The twist, while surprising wasn't great & I have to say the films message felt like a snipe at men with the themes, undertones & implications, not to mention the treatment of most of the male characters in the film who were either looked upon a evil or potential red herrings. The film did drag at 1 hour & 51 minutes & had some pacing issues here & there.The eye candy for the actresses & the gore were however good & there was a great sinister undertone in the film also.The film overall, is mediocre & not as great as made out. The themes, undertones & implications don't help & I do hope if & when Baby Driver 2 gets released & made that Edgar Wright doesn't follows with these themes in the film.5/10.",Last Night in Soho
504,31,arungeorge13,A visually stunning but generic psychological thriller! [+62%],6/10,21 November 2021,"Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho is a visually striking but narratively shallow piece of cinema. The film's aesthetics are undoubtedly on point - be it the color grading, the peppy '60s soundtrack, the artwork, costumes, and all else. It also builds up the main characters of Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) and Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy) pretty intriguingly in the first act. While it's a two-woman show alright, it's Anya who especially puts on a stellar performance. Wright expounds Sandie's disdain for the male gaze in a more detailed, plausible way than introverted Eloise's contempt for her hedonistic peers. The writing becomes pretty bland in the second half, rendering its depiction of contemporary times somewhat pointless.For me, the film fell a bit apart when the two women's lives fused and the horrific visions began to occur. Anyone familiar with psychological thrillers will know how things will proceed once specific plot points come to light. So, while the visual finesse doesn't waver, the storytelling lacks the highs you expect from a guy like Wright. The twists did not land well for me; I could see them from a mile away. Wright barely scrapes the surface regarding women's safety, the infamous casting couch, or mental health issues since he's hell-bent on making the film look amazing. Maybe, he could have gotten rid of a few repetitive sequences of creepy-men-holograms charging at Eloise and made the film crisper (by a good 15-20 minutes).",Last Night in Soho
505,32,martimusross,Stylish Thriller With A Twist At The End,6/10,2 November 2021,"Last Night In SohoI liked it!On the whole this was a stylish and sophisticated thriller/horror set in the present day with recurring dream sequences taking us back to the ""flesh-pots"" of Soho in the 1960's.We had a stellar supporting cast led by Diana Rigg in her final role. The opening premise suggested Eloise had a fragile mentality following the early death of her mother, however it became clear as the movie progressed that she was, in reality, communing with ""dead people"" and the vibrations emanated from previous residents of her bedsit.The movie was not without its problems but these did not seriously effect my enjoyment, these were:The lead actress Thomasin McKenzie possessed the look but not the heft to take the lead. Her elfin looks and squeaky voice, delivering lines by a circuitous route, irritated and that combined with a choice of just two faces fell should of the requirements of the role.The script was more that clunky and ran out of ideas early on, this lead to dragged out repetitive sequences of running down streets in Soho merely to take in the sights and provide padding.The denouement, whilst refreshingly unexpected, was a fizzle rather than an effervesce.I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning a good Halloween horror worth a watch.",Last Night in Soho

508,35,aciessi,About Last Night..,8/10,29 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho really had me hypnotized. I feel like that's a comment that will be said by a lot of people, but that's exactly the kind of effect this film has. Edgar Wright brings us a dreamy, groovy ghost story that heavily pays tribute to Suspiria, along with other film classics from the 60s and 70s. Being Britain's top film junkie, Edgar Wright can get a hold of a camera and make it seem like you're walking into a video store at full blast. His love of this specific genre of horror is just gushing here. His love of music is also as romantic as ever. Music plays just as important of a role here as it did in Baby Driver, even if the songs aren't full-on characters of their own. Mackenzie and Taylor-Joy carry this film fully on their shoulders, and by God, do they rock it. I've been incredibly impressed with Thomasin Mackenzie since Jojo Rabbit, and if this film doesn't rocket her career all the way to the top, nothing will. There's so much to love about this movie. It's a trace. No, it's a trip.

509,36,Anurag-Shetty,Mind-blowing imagery.,9/10,17 November 2021,"Last Night in Soho tells the story of Eloise(Thomasin McKenzie). Eloise is a fashion student, who is surprisingly able to transport back to 1960s London. Here, she meets an aspiring singer named Sandie(Anya Taylor-Joy). Something is amiss, when not everything is as it seems in the past & these dreams turn into something malevolent.Last Night in Soho is a phenomenal film. Director Edgar Wright has given us another unforgettable movie, after Baby Driver(2017), Scott Pilgrim vs. The World(2010) & the Cornetto trilogy. This film is trippy, has awe-inspiring camerawork by cinematographer, Chung-hoon Chung, is genuinely thrilling & edge of the seat & has some witty one-liners sprinkled in, too. The ending was a slight letdown, but this is just a minor gripe. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Thomasin McKenzie is spectacular as Eloise. McKenzie keeps going from strength to strength in her career, after flawless performances in Old(2021) & Jojo Rabbit(2019). Anya Taylor-Joy is outstanding as Sandie. The sky's the limit for Taylor-Joy after her Golden Globe winning performance in limited series, The Queen's Gambit(2020) & perfect performances in The Witch(2015), Split(2016), The New Mutants(2020) & so many more. Matt Smith is fantastic as Jack. Diana Rigg is brilliant as Ms. Collins. Michael Ajao is superb as John. The supporting cast is great. Last Night in Soho is a must watch for Edgar Wright fans.

510,37,bankofmarquis,Unique,8/10,5 November 2021,"Writer/Director Edgar Wright has developed into one of the more unique film makers working today with a stylistic look, feel and sound to all of his films. Long known as the Director of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost comedies (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HOT FUZZ and AT WORLD'S EDGE), Wright started coming into his own with the under-rated SCOTT PILGRIM vs. THE WORLD and the marvelous BABY DRIVER and with his latest film, the trippy thriller LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, Wright has graduated - in my eyes - as a Director who's work is ""must watch"" whenever they come out.LAST NIGHT IN SOHO is unique, stylized, stunning - both visually and aurally - mind-bending, tense and satisfying. A truly unique film by a unique filmmaker.To tell the tale of LAST NIGHT IN SOHO is to spoil it. The less you know about it, the better. But, as the trailers suggest, a modern young fashion student is in London and is transported into the ""swinging '60's London and ends up living, vicariously, the life of another. That's all I'll say. I would recommend just going in and let the story wash all over you - both through the eyes and through the ears - which is why I would recommend this film been seen in a theater (or, at the very least, on a set-up with a killer sound system).Because of the highly stylized and ""go with it"" feel of this film, the performances have a tendency to move to the background, but they are very well done. Thomasin McKenzie (JOJO RABBIT) is a strong choice as the Fashion Student who has this ""adventure"" (to say more is to spoil), she brings the right amount of reality and ""unreality"" to her character. Anya Taylor-Joy (THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT) is superb as Sandie, the object of the ""adventure"". She isn't asked to do much more than be mysterious - and she does it well.Wright, wisely, fills the rest of the film with strong supporting players - Matt Smith (DR. WHO), the great Terence Stamp (THE LIMEY) and, most importantly, Dame Diana Rigg (Emma Peel in THE AVENGERS in the 1960's, in her final film role before her death in September 2020), all bring their ""A"" game to the festivities and fill their roles well.It's not a perfect film, the beginning drags on a bit before things start to get good (and weird) and their is a superfluous subplot involving some ""Mean Girls"" at the Fashion School that our heroine attends in today's world - a subplot that never really goes anywhere. The ending, also, does go ""over the top"", but by that time, I was swept up in the style of this film and forgave it it's flaws.I ended up having LAST NIGHT IN SOHO-type dreams, and indication that this film struck a chord with me and is going to stay with me for awhile - and is probably worth a re-watch (it certainly is one of those types of films that can be different upon a re-watch).Well worth the effort to check it out on the Big Screen - certainly the visuals and sound will make it worthwhile.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Last Night in Soho
511,38,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Loved it.,7/10,19 November 2021,"A very likable stylistic psychological horror film that entertains with its visual, auditory, dance choreography. I was instantly drawn in with the opening dance scene by Thomasin McKenzie in the doorway. I loved how her arms, hands and body swayed to the music. That's one of the things about this film. The 1960s Soundtracks grabbed my attention and the retro 60s visuals lock my eyes onto the screen.The movie carried me into the 1960s. The two lovely and remarkable actresses (McKenzie and Taylor-Joy) blew me away with their dances choreography. The settings, costumes, music and today's modern and colorful cinematography was a real joy to experience.I cannot help to notice director Edgar Wright may have taken inspiration from director Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977). The flashing red and magenta lights seemed to have been inspiration from the older film. Both films also have some story similarities.I am glad Taylor-Joy still continues to be in horror films. After her amazing performance in the Queen's Gambit, I thought she might leave the horror genre. She is so freaking talented its almost unfair to other actors lol. McKenzie's angelic face is also amazing.",Last Night in Soho

513,40,bob-the-movie-man,Edgar Wright's Haunting Love Letter to the Swinging Sixties.,9/10,8 November 2021,"A young 21st-century teen walks in her nightclothes down a darkened alley emerging into a bustling 60's Soho street across from a theatre showing ""Thunderball"". She enters the Cafe de Paris with a reflection mimicking her actions but showing a very different girl. So it was that the trailer for Edgar Wright's ""Last Night in Soho"" hit earlier this year.The trailer grabbed me by the gut and firmly cemented it as a ""must see"" in my movie-watching schedule. Frustratingly, Covid got in my way. But now free of the wretched virus, this had just HAD be my first outing.Positives:
This is SUCH a tour de force of filmmaking. Honestly, there were moments in here, particularly in the first half of the movie, where I was beaming from ear to ear at the audacity of it all. That 'time travel' reveal is even better in 'the flesh' than it was in the trailer, enhanced by the vibrant cinematography of Chung-hoon Chung.Thomasin McKensie again impressed me immensely. She was of course the 'girl in the attic' from ""Jojo Rabbit"" and the best thing in the lacklustre M. Night Shyamalan feature ""Old"". Anya Taylor-Joy is as spectacular as you would expect and Matt Smith also delivers, although I wasn't completely convinced by Smith's cockney accent. And what a wonderful thing to watch veteran actors Terence Stamp and Diana RIgg strut their stuff on the big screen. (This was Rigg's final screen performance, and the film is dedicated to her: ""For Diana"". RIP Ms Rigg.)The combination of 'in camera' and special effects here are gob-smackingly effective. Some of the 'mirror' effects involving Eloise, Sandie and Jack in the club are gleeful. And I'm not sure how they were all done. And a dance sequence where Eloise switches to Sandie and back again is just so clever.The Production Design is just brilliant. It oozes a combination of 60's style and sleaze. Surely an Oscar nomination is due here.As with other Edgar Wright movies (like ""Baby Driver"") the choice of music is superb. The score is by Oscar winning composer Steven Price, but you can be sure that Wright was heavily involved in the track selections. These prominently feature a Cilla Black track - heralded by 15 string beats of total perfection - that is in my top 5 songs from the 60's. And Anya Taylor-Joy's haunting version of ""Downtown"" is just superb.Negatives:
The second half of the film just doesn't *quite* live up to the promise of the first half (which was running as a clear 5*s).While the inevitable twist in the tale is clever (and unexpected), I thought it was rather clumsily introduced. (I can't go into details without introducing spoilers, but an envelope is involved). Something more subliminal would have been my preference; something that you would have had to watch the film again to catch.Summary Thoughts on ""Last Night in Soho"": I loved this one. It lived up to my expectations, and came close to ""classic status"". I need to give this careful consideration as to where this sits in my ""Top 10 Films of the Year"", but it is undoubtedly up there in the list.Highly recommended, if you are content to stomach some violent (and quite disturbing) horror imagery.(For the full graphical review, please check out the full review at onemannsmovies on the web. Thanks).",Last Night in Soho
514,41,abisio,"Great drama / horror film, great director and actresses, great visuals but lots of cheating",8/10,29 October 2021,"Edward Wright was trying to make his own Six Sense version; considering he is the guy after the CORNETTO TRILOGY it is obvious something you want to see. Wright can do outstanding visual tricks mostly without FX and his imagination and rhythm are almost impossible to match. He has a great taste with music and sometimes the movie feels like a musical.Anna Taylor Joy is an incredible charismatic strong actress; like a young Elizabeth Taylor . Thomasin McKenzie is really good in a more easy role. However in the last acts; when she is invaded by madness, her action soars to outstanding levelsThe story takes its time to start with typical clichés like the rural girl trying to adapt to the big city of London (adding some complicated family madness); but Wright uses those common places to play with the public; showing a safe zone that is far from safe. The game is really well played and it shows at the final acts when nothing is really what it seems.Eloise is a shy, rural British young girl that sometimes see dead people (or is very sensitive; her mother committed suicide). She moves to London to study fashion design.; but after meeting a bunch of archetypical IT girls/ room mates; leaves the campus and moves to room rented by an old lady.In her room she starts dreaming about Sandy; very vividly and become enchanted with her personality, her guts and joy of life. After a while she realizes that Sandy's life was not a fairy tale and the happy dreams become nightmares. Eventually the ""chic flic drama"" becomes an unexpected horror movie.There is nothing wrong with all the above; however there is some cheating that might disappoint. Specially the final scene.In any case, this and almost perfect exercise in cinema. With scenes staged in ways not seen in a long long time, outstanding 60s music and very intelligent switch by the end.",Last Night in Soho
515,42,silvermistvio,"Basically fine, except for one tiny detail.",6/10,23 November 2021,"The story is quite good, but it's focused on horror too much and those scenes are less meaningful which means it still works even if it doesn't have those ghosts scenes. So, it'd be better if they didn't focused the film on horror.One more thing I want to mention is the personal feeling. And I know that there will be a lot of people who will disagree on this. But I'm going to say anyway. I feel like casting Thomasin McKenzie was kind of a mistake. Her performance was kind of awful. While I was watching the film, I felt like I was watching a film instead of watching an event really happening in front of me. Every time I watch a film with a bad actor in it, I always get that feeling. Hence, I feel the film will be better if they casted different actress.

516,43,Neptune165,I wish this film worked for me,4/10,19 November 2021,"One night is enough! This film is so over rated. The writing is so bad. The lead girl over acts from start to end. The bad CGI dead men who slept with Sandy look worse than the CGI zombies in I am Legend. I don't think horror when I see that. I just see the weak CGI. The guys who slept with sandy are not creepy at all. Their intent on getting laid is a bit creepy like sad pervs. But using them like some undead legions was zero on the creepy meter. The over used ""that's a beautifiul name"" was a weak line and they beat it to death. The Argento comparisons only go as far as some of the lighting. It comes nowhere near the golden era of his films from the 70's, 80s. Maybe anything from Trauma onward. You just knew that Diana Rigg wasn't just put in the film to be a quaint, old landlady. She's set up to be the last one you'd ever suspect. How do you see the ghost of a woman who is still alive?! The whole, you thought this character was the killer but wait no! It's actually this person. Obvious red herrings. You could se all of those coming up. I really wanted to like Last night but it was so bad on so many levels. The characters were so one dimensional cliches. I couldn't identify enough to get invested or care. The love interest black guy was good, but he was written, directed to be a doormat, weak whiny chump. This film isn't some glorious gumbo of film styles. It doesn't know if it wants to be a 60's throwback, a thriller mystery, a horror, a serial killer movie, a young woman going mad ala repulsion, a ghost ,supernatural film about a living person? The reviews are so over hyped. People just eat up anything and call it amazing these days. The characters are pretty much all horrible people, which is actually fine, but they're boring and movie characters should never be that. They aren't compromised in any interesting way, they're just oblivious to their own actions and have careless morality. The film also turns into a lazy ""me too"" thriller mid way through that left me pretty cold. The last 20 minutes or so are incredibly stupid and might have been my favorite thing about the movie, but probably not in the way the filmmaker intended. I just watched in awe at how morally bankrupt and forced everything became. A very petty and dumb movie in almost every way. A true stinker. Edgar Wright can make an excellent film, but there's zero evidence to that fact on display here.",Last Night in Soho
517,44,Movi3DO,Amazing but not too scary,8/10,1 November 2021,"Time to join the Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie simp club.And it's the last movie of October for me. I was excited for this movie not only because of the trailer, but also because of Edgar Wright, who directed Baby Driver and Shaun of the Dead, two great movies. In fact, Soho was my second most hyped movie for this month, just behind Dune. So it's natural that I had big expectation for this movie.First of all, this movie looked great. Edgar Wright portrayed Soho with such an elusive mix of neon red and other colors that not only make the city looked beautiful but also disorienting and dangerous. The transitions between the present and the past were smooth. As from the trailer, we knew that McKenzie's and Joy's characters were in the same person. The I loved the nice switch between the two characters as well as how they looked through the mirror.The story was also pretty good. Although it wasn't as twisty and unpredictable as I expected, I still liked the descent into madness and blur between reality and dream. The runtime didn't feel too long and as the plot became more intense, I was more drawn into the story.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the two lead actresses. The chess queen Anya Taylor-Joy was mesmerizing as the confident running-up performer. It was easy for her to stand out in the crowd. Thomasin McKenzie was just as amazing with her voice and performance as a young aspiring fashion design student. Both actresses looked incredible and magnetic with their blond hairs and cool costumes. It was hard to look away from the movie because they were on the screen most of the time.My main problem with the movie was that it wasn't scary. Sure, the amazing editing did make many scenes disorienting and intense, but I didn't find myself terrified as the movie intended to.Overall, it was still a damn good movie. Sadly this movie isn't performing well at the box office, which was a shame. Go support and enjoy this mystery thriller. 8.5/10.",Last Night in Soho
518,45,kuarinofu,I reject this movie,1/10,20 November 2021,"How did I get baited for this? I expected a good thriller or an original horror (I mean, it's tagged with those).Last Night in Soho is a very silly, blatant, drawn-out, boring, and pointless set of politically charged stereotypes being shoved up your throat for almost two hours straight.While watching it, I had the constant feeling that it was all a joke, a parody, an exaggeration. But it's not, wow...Is this really the only way you can fish out a couple of festival awards these days? How did we end up in here?There are layers of stereotypes over each other. Virtue signaling in 60's Soho.I'm almost out of words on how blatant and lazy this is. They couldn't even be bothered to at least try to make it somewhat subtle.This is almost a two-hour battle of good vs evil. Our vulnerable miserable female victim coupled with an African-American angel in the flesh, I mean, he is the embodiment of all good in this world - fighting literal armies of evil white men.After watching it, I feel like I was spat in the face with laziness and stupidity. It was as if they were deliberately trying to humiliate my dignity as a human being.Maybe I'm taking this too seriously, but you can't just pack basic stereotypes and elements of the political agenda into a script and call it a movie.They tried to distract me with some nice views from the '60s and a couple of creative scenes, but you're not getting me this time.I have never done this before, but I'm blacklisting the director and the writer of this. I will deliberately avoid their films now.Out of 103 films I reviewed in 2021 - this is the worst one.",Last Night in Soho
519,46,tm-sheehan,Suspense and nostalgia a great mix and Soundtrack,8/10,18 November 2021,"View- Last Night in SohoMy Rating 8/10I really enjoyed this creepy ghost story for a few reasons including its wonderful 1960's Soundtrack featuring a time capsule of hits including Downtown, Puppet on a String, Anyone Who Heart , A World without Love , You're My World , Eloise and many more . The title comes from a song by pop band Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, ""Last Night In Soho"" released in 1968. This is the song that is played during the end credits.The sets and decor and the fashions of swinging London are cleverly interwoven in to contemporary times to create a prism for some very clever tributes to the film noir suspense movies of the 1950's including lots of mirror shattering and dark alleys.There's a lovely dedication in the titles to Dame Diana Rigg in the opening titles as she died shortly after the movie was completed,I hope she wasn't scared to death.The cast is a delightful combination of new generation actors and vintage actors ,aside from Diana Rigg cast as M/S Collins we have other great iconic British actors of the 1960's namely Rita Tushingham as Peggy Eloise's Grandmother and Terence Stamp as the mysterious silver haired gentleman.The two young leads are excellent Thomasin McKenzie as Eloise the young hopeful fashion designer who leaves the suburbs to study in London and Anya Taylor -Joy as the sixties siren Sandy who invades Eloise's dreams or are they reality?No spoilers as usual from me the plot I'll use just the brief IMBD description
In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker.I have seen Thomasin McKenzie before in The King , JoJoRabbit and as recently as yesterday playing Lola in Jane Campions ""The Power of the Dog but this film is a star vehicle for her ,she's perfect as the shy quiet young woman with a tragic family history who like Thoroughly Modern Millie in the 1920's gets a makeover and follows her retro 1960's dream discovering the bright lights and dark characters of Soho.Anya Taylor-Joy as Sandie was superb in The Queens Gambit and continues to impress in Last Night in Soho thus multi talented actress sings a new haunting version of Downtown this was always meant as a tribute to Petula Clark who had a huge world wide hit in 1964. Anya has a chance in this film to show her singing and dancing talents and she looks great in the 1960 fashions designed by Odile Dix- Mireaux.Edgar Wright who directed Baby Driver in 2017 has a great feeling for the era and his ensemble cast fir this film all deliver entertaining performances.I think Matt Smith is so talented he has a great acting range and plays a nasty character in Last Night in Soho as Jack a common West end pimp who thinks of nothing but his own desires and opportunities to exploit young women.Diana Rigg as the mysterious landlady of the bedsit that young Eloise moves into gives a wonderful performance in her last role that just adds to her impressive and very long career that spanned over six decades she would be happy I'm sure with the dedication of this film to Diana.Another well respected actress also died after filming Last Night in Soho so this is also the final performance for Margaret Nolan who is delightful as the Barmaid at the Sage Pub she passed away on October 5, 2020 she has a dedication to her memory in the end credits.A great compliment for this movie came from suspense and horror author Stephen King who had the opportunity to see this movie at an advanced screening and was so impressed by what he saw, he tweeted, ""I got an advance look at 'Last Night in Soho' and plan to see it again when it opens on Friday. I hardly ever re-watch - there's so many good things out there - but this one is special. Time travel with a twist.""
Of course I could pick a few holes in the plot line there wouldn't be any horror melodrama that doesn't get a little off track for the sake of climatic thrills but this film was thoroughly entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable for this movie goer.Take notice at the credit sequence at the end of the film, shots of a deserted, empty, central London flash on screen. All of these shots were completed during the Covid-19 Global Pandemic. The desertedness of the streets is real as England at the time was in a national Lockdown.",Last Night in Soho

521,48,jp_91,One word: Masterpiece!,10/10,29 October 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" is the best horror movie of the year and possibly the best movie overall of 2021. A clever script written by Edgar Wright and Krysty Wilson-Cairns that revolves around the world of fashion, time travel to the great 1960's and back to 2021, although the main theme is broken dreams. In a world that has changed little in more than 50 years, where the dreams of many women are destroyed by men (I'm a man and I admit that it still happens, we cannot turn elsewhere and pretend that nothing happens, if you are the type of a man who is offended by the subject is because you are part of the problem), this dramatic and still current subject is handled with overtones of psychological horror resulting in a masterpiece. Edgar Wright himself, in addition to co-writing the script, directs the film masterfully and knows its story perfectly. Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy excel in their characters, delivering groundbreaking performances. The production design coupled with the costume design and the cinematography result in an eccentric and oppressive atmosphere with excellent visuals. The soundtrack is wonderful, the best in recent years. ""Last Night in Soho"" is a brilliant and powerful movie, everything in it is perfect, a plus if you are a fan of retro style as I am. A masterpiece that goes further!",Last Night in Soho

Stunning cinematography and production design come together to create a visually jaw-dropping 1960s London, which becomes an even more entertaining place to visit due to Steve Price's addictive music.However, the last act feels a sudden hurry to tie every knot through overwhelming editing, hasty pacing, and careless transitions, which work against what the film had been until that point.I commend Wright's commitment and extreme dedication to his vision, but the restraint shown previously should have also been part of the conclusion.""Rating: B+",Last Night in Soho

525,52,Alexander_Blanchett,Midnight in Paris meets Mulholland Dr.,8/10,29 November 2021,"A very original movie. It is precious because original features like this are rare these days and that needs to be pointed out especially if it is as well done as this one.Its a love letter to the 60s. It is ""Midnight in Paris"" meets ""Mulholland Dr.""
Edgar Wright's career is indeed getting into the right direction.He sometimes loses it a bit with it but generally it was a very well crafted will that showcases powerhouse performance of two of the most interesting actresses of their generation. First of all Thomasin McKenzie who is really very good in the leading role of the shy girl that makes a lot of character changes throughout the film. Then you have Anya Taylor-Joy who looks like she was actually beamed out of the 60s. A great performance with many brilliant attributes that once again shows her ability for versatility. Matt Smith had a good moment but his role quickly became very monotone, too bad. Last but certainly not least I want to single out Diane Rigg in her finale performance. And she left the stage with a Big Bang! Very good performance, actually one of the best I have seen her in.It was sometimes a bit predictable but still extremely nicely twisted and even if the big twist could have been seen miles away it was still in for many surprises. Also the style of the film is great. Beautiful look, inspiring editing and an awesome soundtrack.",Last Night in Soho
526,53,MrDHWong,"An involving, intricately plotted tale that features some of the director's best work in over a decade",9/10,18 November 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" is a psychological horror mystery film directed and co-written by Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World""). Starring Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Matt Smith, it is an involving, intricately plotted tale that features some of the director's best work in over a decade.In England, young aspiring fashion designer Eloise ""Ellie"" Turner (Thomasin McKenzie) leaves her rural home to study at a college in London. Sometime after arriving, Ellie decides to move into a single room flat after struggling to make friends with her fellow students and dormitory hall roommates. Once settled into her new place, Ellie starts to have recurring dreams that transport her back to the mid 1960s where she adopts the perspective of a glamorous blonde woman named Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). Sandie's no-nonsense attitude begins to rub off onto Ellie, and the latter becomes inspired to adapt some of the former's personality traits as her own. As the dreams continue, Ellie soon discovers that Sandie's life isn't as perfect as she had first thought, observing that Sandie is being pimped out by sleazy nightclub manager Jack (Matt Smith).There aren't too many filmmakers who have had as varied a career as Edgar Wright. He's made a zombie spoof (""Shaun of the Dead""), an action cop comedy (""Hot Fuzz""), an adaptation of a cult classic graphic novel (""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World""), and even a heist thriller about a deaf getaway driver (""Baby Driver""). It's safe to say that Wright has no particular staple genre when it comes to making movies, although one thing they all seem to have in common is that they serve as outlets for his personal love of the respective subject matter. In ""Last Night In Soho"", Wright tackles the horror mystery genre in his own creative manner, weaving the audience along until an ingenious final act.At first, the film leads us to believe we're going to be watching some kind of surrealist time travel story, setting Sandie up as a person from decades ago who happens to click with Ellie's current world view. However, once Ellie learns the terrible truth, the film takes a sharp left turn into a frightening journey inside Sandie's mind, providing an interesting parable for how female entertainers were treated back in the 1960s. Surprisingly, this approach never feels preachy or that it is being used as an attempt to shame all men but rather it is featured as a backdrop for the disturbing consequences of becoming famous.Just like Ellie, the audience becomes a curious observer of Sandie's affairs, wanting to help her but never able to do so. The horror comes from the appalling reality check Sandie gains upon realising the dark side of fame and Ellie being forced to live through it along with her. By combining these two perspectives, Wright has given us one of the most unique horror films in quite some time. The only other film I can think of that comes close to this style is perhaps 2010's ""Black Swan"", which also showed a daunting uphill battle to achieve major recognition among the elite.I also really love the visual flair Edgar Wright gives this film. His use of flashing light from the neon sign outside Ellie's flat window is cleverly juxtaposed with that of the atmosphere of a 60s nightclub. Moments like this serve as clever transitions into the dream world, making the audience question which parts of Sandie's reality are crossing over into Ellie's and whether or not some of them are merely figments of her own imagination. The dream sequences also do a great job of immersing us in 1960s era London, aided by a memorable soundtrack from artists including Dusty Springfield, The Who, and Siouxsie And The Banshees. Of course, all of this is to be expected from an Edgar Wright movie as all of his previous films have benefitted greatly from equally impressive soundtracks, but never as an innovative tool to transport the viewer back to a particular decade. This proves the importance of music in film so it makes sense that a filmmaker like Wright would be able to implement this into one of his movies.Thomasin McKenzie, who has certainly made a name for herself in recent years, gives perhaps the most mature performance of her career so far as Ellie. The young New Zealand actress does a superb job of not only holding the audience's attention during the film's most bizarre moments but also at making us feel sympathetic towards her whenever she isn't taken seriously by the other characters. Ellie's introverted nature is a stark contrast to that of the exuberant Sandie, whose character is brought to life by the reliable Anya Taylor-Joy. It's so much fun to watch how these two polar opposite characters compliment one another throughout the story, with Ellie clearly wishing she was as cool and hip as Sandie. As brief as his role was, I think Matt Smith is worth mentioning as well. Considering I haven't seen too many of his post-Doctor Who roles, I found it quite jarring to see him play such a perverted character in something like this.With yet another winner under his belt, Edgar Wright remains one of the most entertaining filmmakers working today. He's a director who isn't afraid to try new things, never sticking with just one genre, and I believe that is the hallmark of someone creatively successful. All of that is reflected here in ""Last Night In Soho"", which I think is his best film since 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"". I'd say the film is worth seeing based on the impressive visuals alone but all of that is thankfully complimented by the solid acting and sharp screenplay. Combine all of these elements together and you've got yourself a fine use of just under two hours of your day.I rate it a solid 9/10.",Last Night in Soho
527,54,TheTruthofItIs,"A ""Jane the Ripper"" twister",8/10,25 November 2021,"""Last Night in Soho"" tells the cautionary tale of a ""Jane the Ripper"" homicidal psychotic though you have to make it through several plot twists to experience that payoff. Unlike so many Covid-era one-off productions this one features a writer/director with past successes and that makes all the difference. And he directs Thomasin and Anya to great performances, enough so that I'm seeing awards noms for one or both. Cinematography is nom-worthy, too, the lively lighting, and the spectre-effects show a versatility in one film you don't often see. And the film's climax action scene even has a touching twist to it. And wow, that was 82 yo Diana Rigg as the landlord, in her final role - rest in peace. This thriller was well written, directed, filmed, and produced - very rare for a Covid-era film that's not of a major studio.

528,55,cardsrock,Swinging style,8/10,4 November 2021,"Last Night in Soho is a nostalgic, flashy ride. It's hard to pin down exactly what this movie is, but I kinda like that it's a bit of a chameleon taking aspects from several different genres.Anya Taylor-Joy is magnetic and the true star of the film. She exudes sexiness and has a real presence on film. The story is a bit predictable, but there are still some genuine surprises for audiences. The production design and visuals are simply a treat to behold.It's not Edgar Wright's finest film, but it is a marvelously memorable trip to a fascinating time period.

529,56,CANpatbuck3664,Totally Mesmerizing and Exceptionally Crafted,9/10,15 November 2021,"Last Night in Soho's premise was enough to intrigue me but I'll also admit, having Edgar Wright's name attached was what got me to buy a ticket. He's a great filmmaker, he succeeds in every genre he decides to dabble in (to different levels of success but make no mistake, he's always successful) and he's in the elite class of his trade. I first want to credit him and his team for the fantastic visual work they did in recreating London in the 1960s. Every part of it, from how it was filmed, to the wardrobe, to the music was truly mesmerizing. A common compliment in my reviews is how a successful movie ""transports you into its world"" but instead of grabbing you and taking you along, Soho does the extra work and the transition from one setting to the next is done with artful tact. Despite the gravity of what's going on, the word I'd use is that Eliose's dreams is intoxicating. I liked following Eliose, but there was an element of ""do we have to go back?"" It helps sell why she attaches herself to Sandie so quickly and these nights have almost an addictive-like pull to keep her coming back. It also helps the bottom drop out when Eliose's dreams about Sandie's rise shapeshift into nightmares. But I want to reiterate that this isn't just your run-of-the mill work being done here, it's excellent work to create this kind of spectacle.I want to give a rundown of our main characters and why Soho did its job in getting me to care about their safety. In the early parts of Soho, Eliose is a sweet and repressed girl who's eager to go out and experience the world. She's ready for her time in the sun, but can she hold up to the pressure? Immediately, the kind of struggle she's facing rears its ugly head. She's got a selfish and stuck-up roommate; she's being stalked or aggressively pursued as soon as she steps foot in town and she's seeing ghosts.... A less typical problem but still an unfortunate one nonetheless. Eliose has to deal with a lot but she finds her escape in her dreams about Sandie and despite some elements of her character stretching plausibility (more on that later), Eliose is easy to like. She's a kind hearted introvert and she genuinely cares for Sandie, that checks a lot of boxes for making her a character I want to root for. Many of the same things are true for Sandie, she seems more savvy and worldly wise when she begins talking to Jack but she's quickly in over her head. Her talent is deemed irrelevant by those in power and her ability to service their ""needs"" becomes the only relevant part of the equation. Her issues aren't a unique cautionary tale but how its presented is heartbreaking regardless. Her plunge into this darkness isn't the end of her story and Eliose is committed to getting her some justice one way or another. I also want to include how the movie portrays Jack in this category. He uses Sandie's ambition against her and he's so much more despicable because of how sinister he is. He's a great villain and although I wish his arc hadn't peaked so early, I didn't have any problem relishing in him getting his by the end.I had seen Thomasin McKenzie in a couple of other projects (JoJo Rabbit and Old) and while the quality of those films varied, it was easy to see that she had the talent to do big things. This is a big coming out performance, she's great here as the mousey and frightened Eliose. She helps you see her character's pain and disappointment with how her life in London is turning out and why she'd be so enraptured with Sandie's initially glamorous life. I think that Soho shows that she can anchor a movie and I'm interested to see what she'll do going ahead. Ana Taylor-Joy is already a star but her turn in this just validates her rise. It's difficult to describe her role in this movie, she's in the movie plenty and she's magnetic whenever she's performing as Sandie but she's also a secondary character and she doesn't have as much in the way of dialogue as you'd think. Without spoiling anything, Sandie's story is tragic and all too common before our twist ending, I really felt for her character and I credit her performance for doing the work. Ana Taylor-Joy's great and that shouldn't surprise anyone. Matt Smith is surprisingly threatening as Sandie's manager Jack but he's also really good because he's so charming when he shows up and you see why Sandie decides to trust him despite his actions becoming more and more heinous. Diana Rigg was a fan favourite on Game of Thrones, it was so nice to see her in this. She's given a surprisingly meaty part and I think she sells her role completely in what turned out to be her final performance. Ditto for Terrance Stamp, it was nice to see him get a chance to actually perform. He's not just doing Terrance Stamp in this; he's playing an actual character and there was some nuance to his work. Syvonne Karlson is effective as Eliose's selfish roommate Jacosta and Michael Ajao is limited by his character but I liked his performance as John.Halfway through Last Night in Soho, this was probably one the best movies I'd seen this year (if not the best) and it was definitely the best horror/thriller I'd seen in a long time. I still really like it (more on that in the concluding paragraph) but it does stumble a little after the 2/3 point. Firstly, Eliose is given an unrealistic amount of leeway with her episodes. After the incident with John in her apartment, at minimum, it's time to start calling a psychiatric professional. After her episode with Jacosta in the library, she needs to be locked up (at least temporarily) or put on some type of medication. To be fair, this is emblematic of the genre as a whole, all these people who are being haunted need to learn not to freak out in public and that's not a problem exclusive to this movie. The second is that it's the context of the story that's horrifying in this movie, I feel like the bogeyman they conjured to symbolize Eliose's horror at what happened to Sandie aren't as terrifying as the creative team thought they were. I would say they're mildly perturbing but other than the occasional jump, I didn't find them all that scary. I also want to note that while I really liked the ending twist, I'm not sure it avoided all the potential pitfalls in terms of plot continuity.Despite any reservations I had, I'm so glad I got to catch this in the theatre. I didn't just like this movie at points, I loved it. They give you a story worth following, characters worth rooting for and it's wrapped up with some magnificent cinematography, choreography and top notch acting. Last Night in Soho isn't as smooth throughout the entire runtime but the ending also helps reset the vibe and remind you how special this movie is. I saw this with a good friend and while I enjoyed it more, we both had a really good time with it. Drop by Last Night in Soho if you're interested, it's more about the thrills instead of the chills but you'll enjoy the show no matter what.",Last Night in Soho
530,57,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10/10,22 November 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Every once in a great while, a film will come along that is the perfect blend of everything that goes into it - the music, the cinematography, the acting, the costumes, the sets, the plot, the special effects, the direction and the editing. It is as impactful as it is memorable. It is the perfect movie. I personally feel that ""Last Night in Soho"" is one such gem. From opening scene to last - I was hopelessly hooked.Eloise is a young, aspiring fashion designer who moves to London follow her dream. She loves the music and fashions that echo to her from the distant 60's. She also has the gift of being able to see the ghost of her mother in mirrors - a woman who was also once a fashion designer. After she takes up residency in a small, out-of-the-way apartment, she begins to experience dreams and visions that follow the life of a young woman named Sandie, who also once lived in that same apartment in the 1960's. The dreams turn into nightmares as the two worlds collide, and Sandie's plight becomes frighteningly real.The moment the film opened with Eloise dancing to ""A World Without Love"" by Peter & Gordon, I knew I was in for something different and special. The opening atmosphere/feel became the underlying tone throughout the rest of the movie with very effective use of colors, fashion, and songs from the 60's that made me smile all the way to the end. The dream sequences were well conceived and executed. And the moment that Sandie (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) hit the screen, I could not turn away. Her performance was mesmerizing. This is billed as a horror film, but to me, it was more of a psychological thriller.I absolutely loved, and very highly recommend, this movie. It has quickly become my favorite film of 2021, and perhaps will go down as one of my all-time favorites. It truly is the perfect blend of all its parts, giving us both substance and style. I actually cannot wait to see it again. This comes in at a perfect 10 stars out of 10. I look forward to many more nights in Soho.",Last Night in Soho
531,58,lareval,One of the best films of the year and probably Wright's best work,9/10,2 November 2021,"A stunning, gourgeously shot and flawlessly coloured surprise of a movie. I felt kind of let down with 'Baby Driver' (probably I am a weirdo), but this 'Last Night in Soho' exceeded my expectations. Thomasin McKenzie and Anya-Taylor Joy give their best and Matt Smith makes for a handsome and hideous character. Edgar Wright's direction is compelling, stylish and absorbing. The story may seem kind of predictable on its first half, but the second one and the twist ending caught me completely off guard. Just because of the visual spectacle it really deserves to be watched on the biggest screen in the most luxurious cinema. But its story and the execution is even better. A great, terrific and stiking surprise at the movies and one of the best films of the year. This may be Wright's best work to date. At least, in my opinion.

533,60,Stanlee107,Nostalgic twisted time travel film,8/10,14 November 2021,"It is very British and has an interesting story. Anya Taylor (Sandie) was a (intended pun) joy to watch in this & her many talents were on display. She sings and dances with ease & lights up every scene in which she appears... Similarly, Matt Smith (Jack) oozes swagger & is an interesting antagonist in this. Not to mention, Thomasin McKenzie (Eloise) is the glue that sticks the past and present together.... She portrays the lead protagonist with believable vulnerability and naively and character development. This is set against a nostalgic &thumbing 1960s soundtracks. The film makes it hard to not like it.Eloise gets accepted at a prestigious school in London to pursue her passion/career of becoming a fashion designer that has a particular interest boardering on obsession of all that is 1960s style. She rents an apartment in Soho, London whilst she sleeps she dreams of being a spectator of, but is increasingly more involved in, Sandie's 1960s lifestyle with dire consequences.I thought it would be a dark, British twisted version of La La Land but that would be an unfair comparison. It is great that it starts out like a sweet dream that descents down the rabbit hole that blends a never ending nightmare and despair with visions from the past that may come back to haunt Eloise. The creatures look as though it was taken from Jacob's ladder. The film does well in keeping the viewer guessing until the very end...This has the potential to become a classic.",Last Night in Soho
534,61,statuskuo,If Aileen Wournos Could Talk,7/10,29 October 2021,"It's pretty obvious director Edgar Wright had a really cool gimmick in his head loaded with music and decided to run with that. If you are a fan of 60's tunes, this will be a treat. Take most of that away and it is an extended ""Tales From The Crypt"" Not a bad way to go. BUT, something is just missing. A sense of the why makes one frustrated. Why is Eloise (Thomasin Mackenzie) getting these visions? Why would she be so deserving to share the past?The production itself is one to behold, centered on Sandi or Alex or Andi or whomever you want her to be. Played seductively by Anya Taylor-Joy, whose otherworldly beauty was perfect for this role. A sex kitten whose innocent eyes make men weak. But there is a more sinister way about her ambition. Parallel this with Eloise's entrance into the big city, and you can predict the outcome.This film leaves more questions than answers. One is just inundated with such nostalgia for great music and style it feels crushed by its own detail. Mackenzie, for her part is frustrating. You want to shake the hysterics from her. But somehow gains the sympathy of...more people than she deserves. I'm baffled by the message this entire film asks. If there is a question anywhere. Which leads me to wonder...why?Poor concept aside Anya Taylor Joy is just so watchable. Everytime she's on screen she radiates feminity. And that is worth the price. Aside from that, it follows the same melancholia which a movie like ""Bad Times At The El Royale"" oozes. They share the same DNA when it comes to the haunted 60's. I didn't believe once Eloise was enveloped by the 60's. A movie like ""Somewhere In Time"" nails the obsession perfectly. Here, it's all show which makes her seem more like a hipster than a true fan.The high rating alone is to see Anya's sultry Sandi.",Last Night in Soho
535,62,trinaboice,Lovely and creepy at the same time,8/10,31 October 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. This film won the ""Most Anticipated Film for 2021"" from the Hollywood Critics Association and was nominated for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival.I absolutely adore both of the leading ladies, Thomas McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, so I had to see this. What a powerhouse of talent these two beautiful women possess.THINGS I LIKED:
I've been a huge fan of Thomasin McKenzie ever since I first saw her doe-like performance in the movie LEAVE NO TRACE and JO JO RABBIT. There is something very special about her. She has a unique innocence that is so fresh and charming. Some are already saying she could easily play a future Disney princess. Agreed! Next to the polished and incredibly talented Anya Taylor-Joy, they both keep you mesmerized to the screen. They both showed great physicality and we also get to hear Anya Taylor-Joy sing in this film! Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic in every movie she does. I absolutely enjoyed their performances in this film.I love stylish transitions and there are plenty of them in this film.The fantastic Last Night In Soho (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) blends the stylish 60s with horror. It includes music from Cilla Black, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and other appearances by 1960s legends like Sandie Shaw whose song actually won first place in the 1967 Eurovision competition! The music really takes you back in time and oozes style.Speaking of music, director Edgar Wright has always done a great job incorporating music into his movies in creative ways. I was blown away with how he used music in his movie Baby Driver. I thought that movie was brilliant.I love twists.The use of mirrors in many scenes is clever and well done.Some of the characters go to a Halloween party, so the release of the movie this weekend during Halloween is perfect.If you've seen Italian Giallo horror movies, you'll recognize this film as an homage to that filmmaking style.The subtle and overt aggressions toward women are illustrated very well. Most women will be able to relate, which makes female audiences even more receptive to the actresses' stories in the movie.The production design is really great.The makeup and costume design is also very good. It was clever to darken Thomasin McKenzie's makeup as she fell deeper into her psychological journey.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie feels like it was made by two different directors. The tone of the film is dramatically different from the first half to the second half.The ending is problematic and even frustrating.Sadly, this was British actress Dame Diana Rigg's last film before she died from lung cancer last year. She had a very long career in stage and screen, winning many awards for her performances. In 1988, she was made a CBE in England and named a British Dame in 1994 for services to drama. Those not familiar with her earlier work might recognize her for her role in Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 & 4TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Incredible angles, using of the camera, mirror sequences and absolutely great soundtrack. I also like the main story in the past and the connections with the present story. Great acting overall, especially Anya.When it starts to be a horror film, it loses itself a bit and that is the most disappointing part of the film, as I was expecting much more as a horror film. However, contrary to some, I really liked the plot twist (don't come with the political bs that the ending made the good look bad and bla bla bla, life is like that) and I think that elevates the film to be more than just technically good.

The story covers well-trodden ground, with a small girl trying to make it big in the big city and a portrayal of the seedier side of showbiz as well as the glitz and glamour. The twists are good, although the ending sequence does go on for a bit too long. The acting was good, but some characters felt unnecessary and overall, it could have been a lot darker and more shocking.

538,65,jordan2240,"Some clever film-making, but ultimately made no sense",6/10,31 October 2021,"I enjoyed the film for the artistry that went into making it, and the performances were excellent by the leads, but ultimately, the story didn't make much sense. Why was she seeing what she was seeing - did she have some special power like being able to see dead people? And why was she sometimes incorporated into the character she was seeing and other times a bystander? Don't want to go beyond that because it would involve 'spoilers', so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I'm neutral on recommending it.But be warned, my wife is not a fan of 'horror' movies, and she suggested this one thinking it was a suspense/thriller, then ended up plugging her ears and closing her eyes for much of it. So it might not be quite what you are expecting.

In the 60s.""In acclaimed director Edgar Wright's psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. Last Night in Soho was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Edgar Wright has never made anything disappointing for me, and from comedy to thriller is something exciting to see for any director. Once you've mastered one genre, especially comedy, usually you can do others fairly well. Though the movie didn't live up to my expectations, Last Night in Soho is a pretty good movie. The movie was met with some mixed reviews upon fall festival circuits. The trailer (at least the teaser) doesn't give too much away, so it was up to our imaginations to figure out what the movie was about. Most people thought this to be an artistic, awards contender type of movie. Honestly, it's a little more generic than that. Wright takes inspiration from many movies and the 60s in general to craft this. With as much inspiration as he took, I think he found it hard to come up with something completely original. The whole modern day story needed some work. We have a classic girl moving to London to pursue her dreams, but she's different from the other girls who bully her. I found it hard to really get into the movie with that overkill of a trope. Eventually, it manages to diverge from that.The 60s is where all the excitement takes place. You can tell this is what Wright was most excited for. There's a cool use of sound where it's all mono, but as we go into the 60s it turns into full surround. The whole bustle and feel of the city changed into a dreamland. The production design is impressive. Throughout the movie, we have one of Wright's killer soundtracks to get us in the mood for a great time. The most amazing aspect comes from the lighting. The gaffer must've had so much fun because it's bursting with tons of vibrant colors which are effectively used. Aesthetically and technically speaking, this is amazing. The second best part(s) is Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy. Marvelous performances from both. McKenzie is the clear lead and she gives it her all with a deranged performance. And her counterpart is amazing as Sandi, embodying the token person with high hopes back in the day. It's a really fun time watching the two and exploring the two different worlds.Where the movie falters is in story. I mentioned the beginning had troubles but manages to pick up afterwards. There's so much world building that it almost forgets to come to the right conclusion. The third act is very messy. You can't tell where it's going or what it's trying to do. The big end twist is very predictable. You could tell from the very beginning so it didn't feel like much was gained from it. Also, there's a large use of visual effects and they look terrible. I mean, they get the point across, but they are really bad. When it wraps up in the end, it's kind of a half-assed ending. We have little information about this one aspect of McKenzie's character, and when brought back to it, it feels silly and hardly important. Had the third act not been as convoluted as it was, maybe this could've been to the level of greatness as we expected. Also, Wright tried to make this a Promising Young Woman sort of story where it discusses toxic masculinity and how women have to deal with these unfortunate things. He has the right idea, but it doesn't come across as well as it should've. In the end, I did like it. There's really cool ideas and aesthetics for everyone to enjoy. The mystery may not have been super compelling, but it's there for our entertainment. I'd love to see this again because general audiences are really liking this, at least the few that actually went to see this as it did bomb at the box office. I liked Last Night in Soho, but it could've been better in my opinion.",Last Night in Soho
540,67,ethanbresnett,"""Don't hang around and let your problems surround you there are movie shows, downtown...""",8/10,2 November 2021,"This movie has so much to enjoy it really is a triumph.It has two incredible leads in Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKensie who are both terrific. They each bring something so different and unique to the film and are magnetic when on screen. The two characters were very well written and developed and deserved great performances which they got. There's something in particular about Anya Taylor-Joy that is so captivating and engaging in her performances and she really shone in this film.The supporting cast are all spot on, with a particular nod to Diana Rigg and Terrence Stamp, as well as Matt Smith.The story is engaging, thrilling, scary, mysterious, funny in parts. A lot is crammed in but it still manages to bide its time before erupting in a mighty crescendo. I think the less said about the plot the better as there's lots to discover and much to be revealed and pondered over in this film before the final act. Suffice to say that it is a brilliant watch and unfolds before your eyes in shocking and dramatic fashion.Then there are all the other aspects of the film which are for the most part faultless. The soundtrack went straight into my Spotify library and has been on repeat. The set design and costume are Oscar worthy and I would be very surprised if they don't get a nod at the next awards. The direction, camera work, cinematography are all stunning. This film will be remembered for years to come for numerous iconic shots that will go down in movie history.A terrific piece of cinema that any fans of horror, Edgar Wright, or just good movies will be sure to enjoy.",Last Night in Soho
541,68,midnitepantera,Love the time period and the Fashion! :D,7/10,4 November 2021,"Interesting movie, fun to watch the beautiful 60's sleep world she visits, but EVERYTHING is NOT ROSES!! She wants a life like Sandie's, but learns that All that Glitters Is NOT Gold. :O
I don't think this movie is for everyone, it's more a psychological horror thriller, but mostly well done. The ending was a bit weird, I have a problem with peoples Physical Strengths and Weakness in this movie. But overall a kinda fun, trippy little movie and Anya Taylor Joy is a Beautiful Strange Beauty as always.

544,71,Okonh0wp,A lot to applaud here with Edgar Wright making a non-comic film,8/10,29 November 2021,"Thomasin McKenzie stars as a teenager, Lola, living on the outskirts of London with a bizarrely ambiguous disorder: She sees ghosts but only through the mirror and only one at a time and --- never mind, let's not think too hard about it.Anywho, the plot kicks off when she gets accepted to a prestigious fashion university and starts off with a pretty heavy dose of social anxiety compounded by a bullying roommate (Kassius Nelson). When she decides to take matters into her own hands by getting Satanic revenge on her roommate---oh wait, that's Carrie. This is definitely not a strong anti-bullying anthem of a film. Lola retreats into the posh neighborhood of Soho where she gets an uber-creepy apartment on the fourth floor of an empty apartment. Save for a strict landlord played (in a swan song of a performance by Diana Rigg) who lives on the ground floor.As soon as Lola moves into her new apartment, she gets visions of a new ghost pal (Anya Taylor Joy) that become sensually delighting, unnerving, and emotionally exhausting all at once. She becomes completely consumed while we, as an audience, are increasingly left to pick up disparate parts in what amounts to a combination thriller-mystery with sleek period visuals and masterful editing (something Edgar Wright's films rarely lack).For someone who has made a name for himself in hybrid comedy (comedy apocalypse, comedy horror, etc.), Edgar Wright deserves a lot of credit for his ambitions in making a film that's not comedic at all. It works on many levels: As a mystery, a sleek period piece, a coming-of-age story, and a thriller. The only area where it lacks is that it goes a little heavy on horror tropes with the score and Eldritch Abominations.",Last Night in Soho
545,72,daisukereds,Not all well made movies are good,7/10,22 November 2021,"A young girl (at a point called country mouse), manages to enter a Fashion Design school in London, to which she moves to the city where everything ""can feel like a lot"". From there, she finds herself living someone else's life in her dreams (of sorts).A nice little ""whodunnit"" kind of mystery to pass the time. I wouldn't consider this ""Horror"" but more of a Thriller.It's not made to be a crowd pleaser, as I am sure now that more people won't like it, over those that really will. It's not meant to scare, but to be a bit stressing yet intriguing enough. Even from the start, there's kind of a time displacement where it comes to the time it is set in (not knowing anything about 'til I sat down).Production-wise, it's immaculate. The sound, editing and camera work goes beyond your standard production, and the added visual elements certainly help transmit the ""nightmare"" Eloise finds herself in.. it all makes for a release worth watching in theaters.Script-wise, it's a little weak when it comes to developments (nothing particularly weird or memorable), but execution is as great as it could be for what it is. And while I trust Edgar with every decision he makes on his own projects, I feel like Michael Ajao was a miscast.. at times, his presence and delivery felt straight out of a cartoon. Thomasin McKenzie, on the other hand, does a wonderful job.If this was made for you, then you'd have a blast! Otherwise.. it could be a tad predictable at times, and not fast paced enough, with a conclusion not worth the build up.",Last Night in Soho
546,73,eagandersongil,An adaptation of style.,8/10,29 November 2021,"Last Night in Soro"" is a very interesting film that exposes much of the references of Edgar Wright, English director, extremely authorial and with a very strong comic streak in his cinematography, however, now we saw another side of his taste for art, we saw a strong influence of films such as ""Suspiria"" and ""Sex Repulsion"", the latter directed by Roman Polanski, whose feelings were clearly influenced.Now talking about the movie, the script is good, different, surprising, despite being a little repetitive, especially in its second act, the text works well, deceives the viewer, builds criticism within criticism, creates villains and justifications, no it's nothing bright or super deep, these constructions are shallow, but they work, the social and psychological terror bothers, but the suspense leaves something to be desired, Edgar Wright, as he is not an ordinary director, does not use simple terror devices, but his supernatural devices chosen ones don't work so well.The direction is very good, in the style of Gaspar Noé, Tom Ford, Dario Agento, among others. We have strong colors to mark the violence, red and the contrast with blue, the lights are masterfully well used, just like your camera that always seeks a punctual centrism, the soundtrack, as always in Edgar Wright's works, is a show to part, costumes and makeup are great too, the two main actresses work very well, not only in terms of acting but also in physiological terms, as Darren Aronofsky did in Black Swan, Edgar Wright formed a cast that makes several contrasts between innocence , the angelic and the evil ones.""Spent night in Soro"" is, above all, a film where Edgar Wright tests, changes his gender, his style, but continues with his authorial footprint, referencing classic horror films from the 60s and 70s with a theme that mixes the eras in an engaging plot and a well-constructed direction.",Last Night in Soho

director: Edgar Wright
starring: Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor Joy, Matt Smith, Dianna Rig, Michael Ajao, Synnove Karlson, Terence Stamp etcEloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something far darker. What a fantastic and unique film this was.My first few positives would be the fantastic performances and chemistry between the cast. As well as the amazing cinematography and editing. As well as some interesting and unique elements. And a strongly connected plot. The Whole cast here did a fantastic job. Anya Taylor Joy is such a fantastic actress. She stole every scene she was in with her charm and charisma and delivered an intense and very likeable performance. Thomasin McKenzie also delivered a very strong performance. Also showing a lot of charisma and delivered an intense and unnerving performance. She held her own with the bigger stars. The whole cast also had brilliant chemistry with each other, and this just added to the enjoyment of the film and making it as unnerving as it was. This film had some of the strongest cinematography and Editing I have seen all year. The colour palette of the film was so beautiful and vibrant the film really stood out visually, it felt unique and different to anything I have seen particularly with the dream sequences. And I must applaud the editor of the film. The match cuts and graphic matches were stunning. And how they executed both Thomasin and Anya being in the same scene was incredibly creative and amazing to watch. There were also some really interesting and unique elements to the film. Having Eloise be able to communicate with the dead was a fascinating element to her character and connected it with being able to go back to the past really well. The film in general just felt unique. Whether it was visually, or stylistically this film managed to have a lot of originality to it. Finally, I thought the plot was so cleverly connected. Having Eloise be so influenced by the past and nostalgia and become obsessed with the past. The film cleverly increased the tension and uncomfortable atmosphere with the past slowly becoming a part of the present as Eloise morphed into Sandy and used the same time period as her influence.My next few positives would be the fantastic uncomfortable tone and themes. As well as the fantastic set pieces and bringing the 60's to life. Whilst also having a fantastic script. The film managed to achieve an amazing uncomfortable tone mostly due to its dark but relevant themes on the mistreatment of women both in the past and the present. Eloise was a very shy and reserved character, so it was understandable that she was terrified of going to London by herself. How men mistreated her was very uncomfortable and then the reflection of this in the past and the correlation between her character and Sandy's especially with the use of the ghosts made the film very unsettling. The films set locations were beautiful, soho was such a fantastic and beautiful place to film in, and the locations of the 60's and bringing that era to life was done excellently and It made me want to go back in time. I also thought the films script was fantastic. The subtle but impactful messages it had about the treatment of women will connect with a lot of people and it was so cleverly written.I only had one issue with the film. The final act was slightly messy with its themes and execution. I thought the final act was slightly messy with its themes and tone. The twist was excellent; however, the film took a very campy tone, which worked in some scenes and didn't in others. And the film made it unclear who to align and sympathise with the ghosts or Sandy. So therefore, the impact of the films themes was lost slightly.My final few positives would be the fantastic Soundtrack and development to the plot. As well as the building of tension and use of gore. And finally, the fantastic plot twists. This film had one of the strongest soundtracks of the year. The inclusion of 60's music and bringing that era to life was incredible, I also loved that the film put a modern twist on it with the creativity of the scenes and Anya Taylor Joy providing excellent vocals to downtown which was one of the highlights of the film. I also thought the development to the plot and mystery was excellent. The film built its mystery around Jack and Sandy and what truly happened in the past, as well as Eloise getting slowly taken over by everything was done so excellently and fluently, I was very impressed at how the film flowed so smoothly. I also thought the film-built tension really well, the sense of threat and danger slowly increased as Eloise slowly broke down and it was very uncomfortable and well executed as the themes and sense of danger increased. I also thought the use of gore with the insane plot twists was very good. I didn't see the films plot twists coming at all, it was shocking, clever, and so well executed. I didn't expect the intense gore and where and the film went in a very dark direction, and it was excellently crafted.Overall, despite the final act not fully matching the intensity of the first two thirds. Last night in soho is a visually stunning, bold, and creative film. That stands out from the crowd with its visual style and messages. This is Edgar Wright at his most ambitious and creative.Overall score 93/100.",Last Night in Soho
549,76,zac-04879,"An Old-Fashioned, But Messy Thriller",6/10,19 November 2021,"Edgar Wright knows exactly how to stylishly grant the excellent 1960s touch, but there's only gentle strengths that make his confusing story function finely. The most memorable aspect about Last Night in Soho is how every large element to tiny detail makes a great contribution to the overall execution. Most viewers will adore the frequent music and the very tough acting.There's seriously no doubt that Thomasin McKenzie's and Anya Taylor-Joy's performances live up to one expression: mind-blowing! Not only do they effectively addition to the psychological core, but they could easily label as some of 2021's greatest performances, case closed! Every psychological movie requires this type of acting. But Edgar Wright's direction is also equally as skilled. And the old-fashioned music accompanying the visually-striking scenes is perfectly selected; each song matches every sequence.The only thing that Last Night in Soho has a problem with is honestly just how messy the design seemed to be. For those who aren't willing to research ""ending explained"" or ""movie explained"", it can actually be quite frustrating and difficult to process. It fits perfectly into its psychological aspect with brilliant originality, but simply needs to move somewhat as easier as the first half did.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Last Night in Soho
550,77,movieman6-413-929510,Edgar Wright knows how to mix appropriate film genres in his own way.,7/10,31 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho is a new psychological thriller directed in part written and produced by Edgar Wright, the director of Shaun of the Dead and Babydriver.The film follows the young Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) who moves to London to study fashion design. She expects to break through in the fashion world with this education, but the education and her life in London are more difficult than she expected. In her dreams, Eloise keeps seeing entertainer Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), whom she uses as inspiration for her fashion designs. She quickly becomes a successful student. In addition to fashion ideas, Eloise also learns about Sandie's life in the 1960s during her dreams. Eloise's dreams start to become the pinnacle of her days, but as the dreams begin to get darker, they become more and more like nightmares.Edgar Wright again conveys this new film well in his own way. He does this by mixing different genres in an appropriate way. Furthermore, he also has the audacity to bring out certain things in the film in a way without going too far. This is particularly evident in the film world that is trying to do things more safely and by the book these days, so as not to hurt the hypersensitive. The film also contains good twists, which you as a viewer try to get through before the film reveals it, but because of the writing of the screenplay, the film often manages to stay one step ahead and things are revealed at the right time. Unfortunately, the story lacks some small details that could have put the finishing touches on it if it had been worked out just a little better.Together with his editor Paul Machliss, Edgar Wright knows how to juxtapose the scenes where the main character goes from the real world to her dream world. These scenes are flawless to the secondtransferred. In these scenes they switch flawlessly from Thomasin McKenzie to Anya Taylor-Joy and back again.The switching of film sets makes the switching of these two different worlds seem credible. This is due to the switching of details on the film sets, clothing and music. They also know how to convey the different film genres well.Thomasin McKenzie comes across well as the lead of the film, as someone who tries to do as much as possible in the old-fashioned way in the modern world. Because of what her character experiences in the dreams, she often has to portray the role in other ways. Anya Taylor-Joy also has to play her character in a different way when the dreams get darker. What they do this in an appropriate way law. Terence Stamp also plays a mysterious older man, of whom you as a viewer don't know whether he can be trusted or not. Matt Smith also plays the same kind of role in the film. This film was the last role she played in a movie for Diana Rigg, because she unfortunately passed away last year. Despite having a small role in this film, she managed to end her acting career in a fitting way with this film.Many additional characters in the film unfortunately play weaker background roles in the film and can make the film come across as a bit less. If some of these extras had been left out of the movie, the movie would have been a little better.",Last Night in Soho
551,78,MogwaiMovieReviews,Not Really Even A Movie At All,3/10,27 November 2021,"Watched the new Edgar Wright movie, ""Last Night In Soho"" last night.Yet another modern movie that isn't a movie: no cohesive story; no character development; actors chosen for their race rather than talent; ideological propaganda replacing believability; camera tricks replacing emotional power or coherent meaning.Every bad guy in the film is a dehumanized, predatory white man: the one positively depicted male is the protagonist's black love interest, who seemingly only exists to tell her she's doing great and ""how can I help you?"", having no more volition, background story or internal life than any of the others.When the female serial murderer is revealed and is in the very act of KILLING the protagonist and her boyfriend, the protagonist is sincerely reassuring her that she was right all along to kill all those nasty white men when she was a prostitute. Insanity.It's impossible in 2021 to have a female bad guy: even mass murder is depicted as a celebratory act of ""empowerment"" if the woman is having a bad day. The moral compass of Hollywood is so broken now that I don't even know if it can be fixed or even found. All the people who still remember how to make a movie and what they are making a movie for seem to be just about all dead or dying. Even those who in the past made great movies have bent the knee.Being an Edgar Wright film, it has a great selection of early sixties songs on the soundtrack, but none of them are used well or in a way that really elevates the story, they just feel like a nice playlist of unrelated oldies on someone's iPhone that's playing while they cut the film together in the editing suite.Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz are fantastic films, rightly studied and lauded as near-perfect textbook examples of how to tell a great story in the visual medium. Wright's involvement in Ant Man made that a really enjoyable movie too. The World's End and Scott Pilgrim were more patchy and Baby Driver was a mess, but this is the first one in which he loses hold on the plot entirely, and the whole undertaking collapses before your eyes, resulting in a bunch of images and sounds and special effects that add up to nothing and make no sense. Like I say, not really even a movie at all.",Last Night in Soho
552,79,shashrvacai,Intersting film,7/10,22 November 2021,"Interesting film and very entertaining. There are things that depending on how you view things, may feel like flaws or things the movie did not get right. Stylish and probably with quite a few in-camera effects (I imagine certain tricks were used to avoid a higher special effects cost, but I may be wrong). A few exquisite jump scares and a really good story as a backbone. Great cast - it has been ages since I last saw Terence Stamp on the big screen.

553,80,themadmovieman,A dazzling love letter to London at its best and at its worst,9/10,29 October 2021,"A dazzlingly vivid portrayal of London, an emotionally captivating and thought-provoking pscyhodrama, a visually magnificent production and yet another home run for director Edgar Wright, Last Night In Soho is an absolutely mesmerising watch, and easily one of the best films of 2021.I loved every minute of Last Night In Soho, a film that evolves and changes a lot over its 116-minute runtime, but always has a trick up its sleeve as it takes bold and thrilling turns at every step.There's so much that makes this film such a dazzling watch, but we'll start with the brilliant lead performances from Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy, whose fantastic energy makes this movie an enthralling watch from the first minute they arrive on screen.While Edgar Wright impressively directs a whole ensemble cast here, McKenzie and Taylor-Joy are the real standouts, each delivering genuine yet exciting and mysterious performances that bounce off and parallel one another brilliantly throughout.That plays into the film's captivating psychological element, as we see young Thomasin McKenzie in modern-day London become obsessed with Taylor-Joy, an aspiring singer whose dreams take a dark turn when she finds herself caught up in the underbelly of Soho in the swingin' sixties.Not only does Last Night In Soho brilliantly balance its focus on modern-day London and that of yesteryear, but it uses parallels in geography, style and essence to great effect, bringing that into the central character story at hand and pulling you ever deeper into what starts out as a dazzling whirlwind, but becomes something rather a lot more challenging.The first act of this film is exciting, vibrant and wonderfully imaginative, capturing the wide-eyed innocence of a country girl arriving in the big city for the first time. But beneath the superficial thrill of a lively London lies a dark reality, which Last Night In Soho handles in a uniquely lively way, but also with riveting, thought-provoking dramatic depth.While never ignoring the gritty, sobering and desperately depressing reality of the industry that underpinned Soho in the '60s, director Edgar Wright brilliantly keeps the energy and pizzazz that makes this movie so electrifying even through its darkest moments.That makes for an exhilarating blend of disturbing drama, eye-catching style and even some darkly funny moments that build and build and build as we see the psychological state of our main characters deteriorate.While Last Night In Soho may be all The Look Of Love on the surface, it's rather more similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion, using its setting to brilliant effect as it turns from a dark love letter to London into a maddening psychological thriller that never lets up until the last minute.Bathed in spectacular colours, featuring gorgeous cinematography and a memorable soundtrack, Edgar Wright leaves no stone unturned when delivering yet another feast for the senses after the rocking rollercoaster that was Baby Driver.But with a bold combination of dark, sobering drama and high-octane, lively and dazzling thrills, Last Night In Soho offers up an entirely unique viewing experience, that's simultaneously huge fun to watch while being immensely insightful and thought-provoking in its subject matter.",Last Night in Soho

557,84,patriciogl10,Edgar Wright finds inspiration in 70s giallo.,8/10,20 November 2021,"Long has it been since Edgar Wright delivered a truly satisfying output that establishes him as one of the most interesting directors in the business, whose releases are always awaited eagerly. With this new entry, his gripping visual style fits perfectly giving the puzzling nature of the story. A quite comfortable throwback to London in the 60s for the viewer proves to be horrifiying for Eloise ""Ellie"", played wonderfully by Thomasin McKenzie, whose only interest is to become a fashion designer. Soon, in a bizarre fashion, she begins to have real contact with the past, by staying in a room containing some skeletons in its closet. She mirrors the image of wannabe star Sandie (played by Anya Taylor-Joy, whose performance is not all that appealing to me, besides her wardrobe fitting so stylishly) and sees her shot at stardom being nothing more than a channel for an underground net of prostitution, and then, psychological horror ensues, as Ellie is now haunted by Sandie's memories of continuous abuse by ghosts of horror past.The giallo influences are more than evident, which prompts an eerie sensation at least in my case, as I'm reminded of such excellent films like Suspiria or Deep Red, or even Polanski efforts including The Tenant or Repulsion, and Wright knows his film history, so he knows exactly how to deliver an homage in a proper manner, and without abandoning his own rich vision of filmmaking.If you ask me, Last Night in Soho is one of the better films of 2021, and is also your chance to witness the late Diana Rigg, in her final performance, who I might add she absolutely shines. So come along and enjoy the ride.",Last Night in Soho
558,85,tccandler,It is a near miss.,5/10,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright made the cult-classic, ""Shaun of the Dead""... but has never quite lived up to the success of that movie. All of his subsequent efforts have been mixed bags to say the least. The same is true of this film... a psychological horror with good performances, striking visuals and dazzling camerawork. However, it is more of an interesting, ambitious failure. It doesn't hold up to detailed scrutiny. It muddles tone. It feels more like an ode to a time and a place than an actual logical narrative. It is a near miss.

559,86,darkreignn,A generic story told in a unique way,6/10,29 October 2021,"Edgar Wright dips his toes into neon-drenched noir with ""Last Night in Soho."" Foregoing his biting comedy, Wright instead opts for relevant drama, weaving a story that combines past and present to warn of the dangers of selling one's soul for a shot at fame and fortune. Yes, ""Last Night in Soho"" aims high - and in some ways, misses the mark.Besides its gimmick, which I will not spoil on the off-chance that you've not seen the trailer, this film doesn't offer much that we haven't seen before here - and I'm speaking strictly about the plot. As much as I wanted to fall in love with this movie, the main drawback was the story that it decides to tell. Wright tells a tale of the corruption of innocence, the price people pay for pursuing their dreams. However, the price paid, in this film's case, is extremely predictable and has already been explored in a countless number of other movies. Yes, the content of the movie may be particularly relevant in today's day and age, especially as we live in a time when a new scandal seems to be hitting the mainstream every day. The problem is, in real-life, these scandals genuinely shock because of how unexpected they were (at least, at the time. Nowadays I find myself more surprised when a scandal doesn't happen). Because of this, in ""Last Night in Soho,"" you can already see the conflict coming from a mile away.While the film is somewhat unique in the way the story is told, the story itself is not too distinctive. Luckily, the visual flair and rocking soundtrack makes the viewing experience enjoyable. Wright knows style, and his skills are on full display here - there is barely a moment where the movie doesn't look incredible, full of depth and color. He also shares his fine musical taste, which makes for some seriously toe-tapping sequences; I honestly found myself dancing in my theatre seat frequently.Wright also manages to coax incredible performances out of his actors, with Thomasin McKenzie being the standout. Thomasin was brilliant here, proving herself as a leading actress. Her performance was genuinely riveting - she adds a sort of sympathetic tenderness that makes you care so much for her. Anya Taylor-Joy was also fantastic, as always, not only showing her acting chops, but also her musical prowess with her singing. Thomasin has more screen time than Anya, but whenever Taylor-Joy is on the screen, she'll have your full attention.While the film was somewhat generic in the story it chooses to tell, I have to give it props for, at least, telling the story in a unique way. I do think Wright could have pulled a few more tricks out of his sleeve to truly make this movie a daring, novel experience, but overall, ""Last Night in Soho"" is enjoyable. The style and flair is worth watching the movie for, but, in my opinion, if you go to see this film, go see it for Thomasin's stunning performance - you won't regret it.",Last Night in Soho
560,87,TheCorniestLemur,Lahndan Tawn,8/10,6 November 2021,"I'm always intrigued when a director known for one genre tries their hand at another one, and christ almighty, I thought Baby Driver was Edgar Wright doing that, but nooooo. This is him doing that. Honestly, if I hadn't known he directed it, he would have been just about the last person I would have ever guessed made it.So don't watch this expecting more Cornetto trilogy or Scott Pilgrim-type stuff, and yes I do feel the need to say that seeing as no one's watching it anyway, and those that are were probably solely drawn by Edgar Wright's name being on it; this is a somewhat oldies-inspired psychological horror, and honestly? It's damn good at that.Not that it's scary all the way through or anything, but certain scenes...well, goddamn, it's been a looooooong time since I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable in a cinema. And holy crap this film achieved that. Which makes me realise that seeing as I'm a man who has never had any...unwanted sexual advances, let's say, and it still got to me quite a bit, if you're a woman who has dealt with things like that, then...I think you'd probably appreciate how this film deals with that, but maybe be a bit careful, yeah?Well I say I think you'd appreciate how it deals with these things based on what I know about trauma, and I certainly was...for a while anyway, and then the ending came. I'm coming around more on the positive end thinking about it now, but as it was happening I didn't quite know what to think. And I don't know what anyone else would think, but I'm willing to bet it's a divisive ending at the very least. Up until that at least, I was absolutely loving where it was going, and the more I think about it, the better I think the ending actually is.While this is the least noticeably ""Wright-ish"" film Edgar Wright's made up until now, that doesn't mean it's badly directed, because while it isn't the style you typically associate with his work...come on, that wouldn't work at all for a horror film, would it? Whatever style you want to call this, though, it works for the film. There's definitely a lot of shots I'm going to have stuck in my head for a while, and knowing Edgar Wright, I'm willing to bet there'll be a few things that make me go ""Oh yeahhhhhhhh"" when I rewatch it knowing what's coming.The production design and lighting really stand out to me as well, for reasons that'll be obvious to anyone who's seen it, and even if there's one or two little plot holes that really bugged me, and two of the characters' purpose in the film is somewhat questionable, the performances from everyone are so damn good all the way throughout that they still don't feel misplaced unless you really think about it. Like honestly, I am convinced that Anya Taylor-Joy is going to go down as one of the best actors of this generation, and Thomasin McKenzie carries the majority of the film really well too.So while I'm certainly happy that Dune is getting its second part, I'd be very unhappy if Edgar Wright starts getting restrained in what he's able to create, and if you're on this website, you probably would be too, so can we bring the same energy we had for Dune to this? Pretty please?",Last Night in Soho
561,88,TheVictoriousV,"Flawed but likely to be loved by the ""Good for Her"" crowd",5/10,3 November 2021,"Edgar Wright goes Argento in Last Night in Soho, and it makes some sense that he would delve into neon-bathed horror nostalgia after dipping his feet into neo-noir (a genre often associated with colorful, sometimes homoerotic lights breaking the noir darkness) with 2017's Baby Driver. It's a shame that it would fall a bit short.Indeed, even as love letters to Argento-era horror go (with a splash of the Swinging Sixties this time), this one's not as good as Beyond the Black Rainbow or even this year's Censor. I don't know if it's better or worse than The Neon Demon (the most Suspiria-esque of the films I've listed). As for the filmography of Edgar Wright, the man whose distinct visual flare is still the subject of every video essayist that's already covered Wes Anderson, this is pretty disappointing and humorless.The film might find some fandom in the ""Good for Her"" community, where people treat characters like Cassie Thomas, Cecilia Kass, and Amy Elliott Dunn the way those same people feared that school-shooter incels would do with Arthur Fleck when Joker came out. It's not likely that this film will face the same scrutiny; that critics will whine that it either glorifies violence or has the wrong implications about marginalized groups (abuse victims instead of mental patients, in this case). I guess that's somethin'!But is there anything in here for those of us who simply value quality? Well, the imagery inevitably looks nice and atmospheric despite often lacking Wright's usual energy, the Swinging-London costumes and production design are often convincing, and as it turns out, Anya Taylor-Joy can really sing! A happy surprise on an already groovy soundtrack.I just don't find myself caring a great deal about the story, though I do enjoy its premise, where a young modern-day country girl (Thomasin McKenzie) moves to London and begins having dreams where she observes the same city, 60 years earlier, through the eyes of a singer named Sandie (Taylor-Joy), thus discovering secrets of latter's fate. There is a violent pimp played by Matt Smith (almost as deliciously nasty here as in the similarly neon-laden Lost River) and, in present-day, a similar-looking mystery man played by Terence Stamp. We also see Diana Rigg in her final film role.If you think this sounds eerie and maybe a bit interesting, I would agree with you. Alas, this connection between two women separated by six decades never gets at anything deep, and as Robert Daniels pointed out ""Wright doesn't have anything to say about the sex industry, the casting couch, or mental health beyond a surface-level understanding"".I am not as bothered by this as Daniels - there is plenty of fun to be had with the gore and references - but it does reek of missed potential. And even the high-energy, dumb-but-fun horror stuff is, once again, not as visually meticulous or purposeful as some of Wright's older imagery (the most obvious comparison is to his seminal Shaun of the Dead and one early sequence is, for what it's worth, nearly on par with Baby Driver). It can be downright disorienting at points.Last Night in Soho has its moments and Anya Taylor-Joy is Anya Taylor-Joy so of course this isn't a wholly worthless film. And as I've noted, some demographics are sure to outright adore it. Good for Sandie.",Last Night in Soho

563,90,Lewis_Heather787,Not mysterious nor frightening!!,5/10,31 October 2021,"When I first heard about Edgar Wright making a Thriller/mystery murder type of film, I have to admit I was curious to see how that would turn out. For me he is a complicated director that can either wow me with some quality memorable films and also drive me crazy with some awful decisions. I know I'm in the minority on that and 100% will be about this film too. Due to the fact that once again he has made a film that is more style over substance, I was pretty bored watching ""Last Night in Soho"".Before I start to complain, whine and moan about what I thought was wrong about this film, there are still thankful some good aspects to it. Firstly the three main leads are all absolutely stellar across the board. Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith and Thomasin Mckenzie are equally great in their roles. I have to say I'm especially happy for Smith because I've always thought he had the acting ability to be given a bigger chance in hollywood. I really hope this role helps him get more chances because he was great !!. Taylor-Joy we know by now she is already a star having given plenty of great performances over the years and this is no different!!! McKenzie yet again adding another performance to her very young career, no wonder people think she'll be even bigger name in the future.The other area I like about the film is the production design and the transformation of London is really really amazing to see on screen. Credit should go to Wright and the team behind it because they done some incredible work.However, *sigh*............. I'm starting to get the feeling that Edgar Wright likes to think he makes complicated pieces of film like Nolan, Villeneuve, Tarantino and PTA just to name a few. For me though he falls way way low of anywhere near that level of story telling with this new film especially. Just like with ""Baby Driver"" I heard a recently interview with Wright saying how he came up with the soundtrack of the film before even writing a single line of the script. To me it shows massively where he spends most of his creative energy and it is 100% not story which it should be.This film is lacking huge amounts of depth that it so desperately needs because sadly the story to this film is plain boring!! Even as the film progresses every turn it takes doesn't add anything of mystery or interest to me, it is all just so surface level. Plus then the obvious twist that comes at the end is so ridiculous it is almost laughable. Its a huge shame because the characters he had created were decent enough with great performances. Sadly he didn't give them the interesting, nail biting, complex, ambiguous and thrilling story they desperately needed.I am pretty sure I'll never see this film again, it gives me no feeling of re-watchability at all. Doesn't make my mind want to find all the small hidden details and meanings, not that there are any!!!........I could not care less !!!55% out of 100 a disappointment however more confusion given the bizarre positive reviews this film is getting. Maybe I watched a completely different film to everyone else. Three great performances however more style and less substance makes this attempt at a murder mystery go out with a whimper.",Last Night in Soho
564,91,mr_bickle_the_pickle,You can always go downtown....to the movies,9/10,3 November 2021,"I thought it was a very well done original story. I really liked the horror and mystery elements as well as the feminist approach to the story. It has a great soundtrack and definitely makes you want to get into the 60s vibes yourself. I think the third act does get a bit muddled. Even though a part of me suspected the ""twist"", I wouldn't say it was predictable. It was more so the reveal of it. And I felt it opened up more questions. Still though, overall it's a highly entertaining film and Thomason and Anya are equally great in this film and very captivating to watch on screen. Probably my favourite film of the year so far.

566,93,AdrenalinDragon,Edgar Wright's first misfire,8/10,29 October 2021,"Last Night in Soho proves Edgar Wright is best when he has a bit of fun with his films rather than taking them deadly seriously. In the end, the Horror direction he has taken here is pretty underwhelming and ticks off a lot of cliches and predictable writing. The movie thinks it's cleverer than it actually is and all it does is make it come off as a little pretentious. The characters didn't leave much of an impression here either by the end.There's some pretty good production values and stylish shots and performances, but it feels a little derivative. The dreamy sequences kind of get mildly repetitive and by the end the movie just doesn't know what it wants to be. There's lacking a bit of spark and fun that Wright usually brings to his films so this one ends up being a little forgettable. Overall, it came out feeling like a big letdown.5/10.

567,94,isantistao,A Stunning Cinematic Spectacle,10/10,7 November 2021,"I was totally blown away by this movie. For starters the cinematography is just stunning. It is full of brilliant and beautiful colors. And the film is the perfect blend of light and dark imagery, and it can get a bit trippy at times too which I love. It also features two beautiful young actresses putting on a captivating, even hypnotic performance. Especially due to the singing and dancing of one of them. And the film combines multiple different genres and styles, primarily time travel and horror, which have never before been combined and create quite a fantastic story. And a few sub genre's, namely murder mystery, fantasy, and tragedy. It does of course have a few twists in it, along with a really big one at the end that will put your jaw on the floor. And I'd also like to mention that there's a lot of great music from the 60's in the film as well so if you like 60's music you will enjoy it as well. So all in all the film is a true masterpiece, a perfect 10. I highly recommend seeing it in the theater while you can, this kind of stunning cinematic spectacle really should be viewed on the big screen so that you can be fully immersed in the very colorful and entrancing work of art that it is.",Last Night in Soho
568,0,lee_eisenberg,"you've got a talent, so make something of it",10/10,22 November 2021,"I first learned of Venus and Serena Williams in the late 1990s, and heard about what fine tennis players they are. Although I'm not into tennis, there was no denying their talent.What I didn't know about was their life story. Reinaldo Marcus Green's ""King Richard"" looks at this, with Will Smith as their father, a man who gave tough love out of a desire for his children to have a better life than he had.This is a great movie all around. Part of it is that it's good to see Smith taking serious roles (it was fun to see him play hip dudes, but he couldn't do that forever). Beyond that, every cast member puts in a fine performance, and it's lovable to see the whole story plain out. If you have any extra time, definitely see this one.

569,1,CinemaSerf,The ultimate pushy parent...,6/10,9 November 2021,"This is one of these stories of dedication and inspiration that ought to have made for compelling viewing. Sadly, though, it doesn't. Will Smith is the eponymous character, the father of the now legendary Serena and Venus Williams, and the narrative depicts his vision and determination to ensure that his daughters grasp every opportunity - willingly or less so - on their journey to undoubted tennis greatness. Sadly, though, I just found it all too focussed on an unremarkable performance from Smith. Though he does come across as a tightly focussed man, he also comes across and a rather unpleasant, thoughtless individual for whom, after a while, I began to feel a growing dislike. The somewhat arbitrary way in which he treats not just his family, but those around trying to help (and, admittedly, to capitalise on the impending gravy train) is all just bit too improbable. Had I been Rick Macci (John Bernthal) or Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn) I would have told him where to get off long before it became apparent that these two girls actually did have the ability to make it big. The acting efforts from the two young women are engaging, as is that from their mother Aunjanue Ellis but they are all too often subsumed in the domineering shadow of Smith. At 2¼ hours, it is also far too long. There are too many scenes that detract from the pace, offering us an increasingly annoying, meandering, lack of impetus and I could have done with far more input from the real ""stars"" of the movie to illustrate just how determined and accomplished they were (as opposed to their father). I know the film is about Richard Williams, but I found that whole emphasis just a bit skewed. There are far more interesting and nuanced characters in this story of these ladies that ought to have featured more prominently, rather than simply a chest-banging exercise for him!",King Richard
570,2,Calicodreamin,"Good, but slow",6/10,23 November 2021,"A strong message of perseverance and determination that only Will Smith can deliver. The Williams sisters serve up a good dose of empowerment and inspo. The film itself is slow and repetitive, a lot of long scenes and the same monologues served up in different words.

571,3,ferguson-6,The Plan,7/10,18 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sports parents. Band parents. Dance parents. Cheerleader parents. Drama parents. We all know THOSE parents ... and many of us, whether we admit it or not, ARE those parents. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green (JOE BELL, 2020) and first time screenwriter Zach Baylin bring us the story of the unconventional, hard-driving, flawed, well-intentioned father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.Will Smith portrays Richard Williams in a showcase role that he capitalizes on. Richard Williams is not a particularly likable man - his hustler mentality is eclipsed only by his stubbornness. But more than anything, Richard Williams was committed to giving Venus and Serena every opportunity to succeed in a tennis world that seemed like a different universe to the Compton neighborhood in which they were raised. Richard and his wife Oracene (an outstanding Aunjanue Ellis, THE HELP) coached the young girls themselves in public parks via instructional articles in Tennis magazines. Both parents balanced their jobs with this coaching, and Richard spent a significant amount of time ""marketing"" the girls to professional coaches, most who had no interest in taking on pupils who couldn't pay.Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and younger sister Serena (Demi Singleton) trust whole-heartedly in ""The Plan"" their father has in place. It's a plan designed to place million dollar checks in their hands, and lead them to the top of the tennis world. Their first break comes in the form of John McEnroe coach Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn), who agrees to coach Venus. The real fun begins when Richard cuts a deal with super coach/trainer Rick Macci (a terrific Jon Bernthal) to take on both girls and cover the families living arrangements in Florida.What makes this film work is that so many of us can relate to just how difficult it is to be a parent, and never settle for less when it comes to the kids. Now, Richard Williams is an extreme example - and his enormously successful daughters have dealt his approach a hand of credibility. Richard and Oracene are presented as very protective of their daughters, but also obsessed with helping them excel at school, tennis, and life. Given that there are three other daughters living in the house, it's surprising that we don't get more details on the reactions from those girls to the favorable treatment of Venus and Serena. The family is presented as being very tight-knit and loving, but it's difficult to swallow that jealousy didn't rise up periodically.This truly is the story of how Richard Williams remained focused on getting his daughters to the top, so don't expect the tennis history of Venus and Serena. The young actors playing them are excellent, but this takes us through the foundation of their careers while overcoming adversity, not the professional highlights. Oscar winning cinematographer Robert Elswit (THERE WILL BE BLOOD) makes the tennis look legitimate, while also bringing us the family intimacy. In fact, the scene in the kitchen is one of the more intense and well-acted scenes we will see this year, and the camera work amplifies the tension. On the lighter side, we get Will Smith singing Kenny Rogers' ""The Gambler"", and the closing credits show actual clips of Richard, Venus and Serena, as well as a rundown of their impressive achievements. Director Green has delivered a crowd-pleaser with some poignancy and a few well-placed messages. It wouldn't surprise to see a few award nominations attached to this one.Opens in theaters and streams on HBO Max beginning November 19, 2021.",King Richard

Will smith as the father is a winner, but most of all the junior actors in this film amazes me, they do know how to play tennis, and they do know how to act, therefore a hi five to them and the cast.Its not a highly original plot and setup for a sportsmovie, but its filled with love and humbleness, lots of humour, but also dominating parents that may be disliked by some, like me the grumpy old man, but its a romp worth to watch for the great tennis acts and sky high spirits.",King Richard
573,5,cruise01,Will Smith giving his best in a strong sports drama.,8/10,23 November 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.King Richards is a good biographical drama film that gives Will Smith to shine with an outstanding performance. And making this film one heartfelt story about Richard Williams (Will Smith) who is raising his two daughters Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) and plotting a life course of a successful professional tennis player path.What Worked? It is a strong and heartfelt story. Richard plotting a path for his two daughters to become professional tennis players. It is strong. Richard is brilliant and stubborn. He even rejects professional tennis coach offers cause he felt like they were not right for his daughters. Which is a huge risk rejection. Of course things fall into place when he comes across Rick (Jon Bernthal). The story is good.Will Smith delivers with another outstanding performance. Which he is a good actor. When he is on screen as Richard, he literally displays a whole different character on screen. Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton were both great with there characters. Aunjanue Ellis playing Brandy, there mother was also good. Jon Bernthal playing Rick who tries to lead the girl in a right path as a coach was also good.What did not work? I felt like the film does have a little uneven pacing with its direction.Overall, it is one strong emotional heartfelt story that will shine of seeing two rising tennis players becoming the famous players today.",King Richard
574,6,Top_Dawg_Critic,It will make every sports-parent feel inadequate.,8/10,25 November 2021,"Even though the 144 min runtime flew buy, I felt there was too much filler on Richard and little substance for the sisters. I would've enjoyed more of Serena and Venus at the current runtime, or cut out much of the fluff on Richard down to 110 mins tops.The directing was excellent, and Smith's performance was stellar as Richard, and the rest of the cast was spot on. Cinematography and score were great. Certainly a decent one-time watch, especially for fans of the sisters. The ending real-life photos and videos had a really uncanny resemblance to all the actor's characters. It's a well deserved 8/10.

575,7,paul-allaer,"""The Man With a Plan""",7/10,22 November 2021,"As ""King Richard"" (2021 release; 144 min.) opens, we are immediately in the thick of things as Richard Williams is a man with a plan, ""to go from protege to pro"" for his young daughters Venus and Serena who are budding tennis players. Alas, things are not as easy as they look, given that the Williams family is from Compton, CA and nobody in the tennis world is waiting on a black female tennis star (let alone two). But Richard perseveres... At this point we are 10 min into the film. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green (""Monsters & Men""). More importantly, the Williams family gave its full blessing to this film, and Venus and Serena are both credited as Executive Producers. The script focuses very much on the complicated figure that is Richard Williams. Is he the well-meaning father who just wants his girls to succeed, at any cost? Or is he a self-promoting grand schemer? What if he is both of those, and more? The script dives deep into this character, and that is the ultimate reason why this film is so surprisingly effective. Because we know how this will end (spoiler: both Venus and Serena will conquer the tennis universe!), it's all about the journey on how Richard got them to that point. Much has been said already about Will Smith's lead performance, and let's just go ahead and say it: he is fantastic in this role, and his Best Actor Oscar nomination is already assured (with a win quite likely). The rest of the cast is equally great. Check out a pivotal scene between Richard and his wife Brandy (played by Aunjanue Ellis) when Richard has made a pivotal decision without consulting her. Top-notch acting all around. The movie covers events up to 1994 (when Venus was just 15, and Serena just 13). I had forgotten the details of Venus' first tournament as a pro. It gave me the chills as I watched this.""King Richard"" was supposed to be released exactly a year ago, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans (and almost almost brought the movie theaters industry to its knees). The movie FINALLY premiered in theaters this weekend, while also simultaneously streaming on HBO Max (where I caught it). Despite universal acclaim for both the movie (certified 92% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and for Will Smith, the film underwhelmed at the box office (just $5 mill, significantly below expectations and projections). It's not hard to see why: this is not an ""action"" movie or a movie about superstars Venus and Serena. It is a nuanced character study of a man with obvious flaws but who also surprises us in other ways. If that sounds like it might be your cup of tea, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in theaters or on HBO Max, or later on other streaming platforms and also on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",King Richard
576,8,CubsandCulture,Effective Oscar bait,6/10,22 November 2021,"Smith fans should be pleased with this film. It is a good show case for the actor. It is one of Smith's better performances as well. It's almost real acting from the star. The film is perfectly pleasant because of Smith alone.I however am not overly fond of the film for two reasons. First, the direction and parts of the screenplay are dramatically inert. The climax of the film feels much more like a reversal of fortune and not an ending. And while the direction is technically polished it is uninspired. Second, the decision to frame the story as Richard's is decidedly odd. Some of the material is refreshing in a sports film context but Richard Williams should not overshadow his daughters because they are the ones who did the main work. The film robs the William sisters of a lot of agency-it feels gross in retrospect because it is clear that Smith shaped the story to make the film a vehicle to win an Oscar.The film works and I think tennis people will get a lot from it. But the film is basically just a really good lead performance from a character who should have been in a supporting role.",King Richard
577,9,yusufpiskin,And the Oscar goes to...,9/10,29 November 2021,"After years of trying to prove he's a good actor, Will Smith now wants to win an Oscar statuette.My personal opinion is that it should have won an Oscar already.If we talk about the movie, it allowed me to watch a subject that I am not very interested in for two and a half hours.Even this is a great achievement in this age.I mean, putting people who are bored with half-hour serials on the couch for two and a half hours.

578,10,masonfisk,GOOD FILM FOR THE SOUL...!,8/10,29 November 2021,"Will Smith is back in his ever loving, audience pleasing best in this recent biopic release of Venus & Serena's father, Richard as he guided them from the mean streets of Compton to being the best tennis players of their generation & possibly ever. A transplant from Louisiana & not a stranger to racism, Smith sacrifices every & all so that he & his 2 nascent tennis prodigies achieve their goals even though a major stumbling block comes in the form in finding sponsorship. When he finally crosses that hurtle, securing Venus a coach, played by Tony Goldwyn, things starts to move (Serena is not completely left out as Smith's wife, played by Aunjanue Ellis, steps up to continue her training) but when Goldwyn pressures Venus to compete in the juniors, Smith is reticent her childhood may be sacrificed (something that carries over when Smith switches coaches ending up w/a Florida based heavy hitter, played by the Punisher, Jon Bernthal). Letting some years lapse between her eventual debut at 14, Venus faces the best player in the world, will all the hard work & perseverance pay off? The only thing one would need to check is the history books (or youtube to see how the game played out) but as most successful bio flicks set out to & achieve, even knowing the outcome of said match, doesn't diminish the audiences' appetite to see a talented girl make good. Smith, who will surely get another Oscar nom for his prickly pear of performance (was all the hard work he instilled in his daughters for his sake or theirs?) but the actresses tasked to do not only do the physical labors but also the emotional heft (Saniyya Sidney & Demi Singleton) are equal to Smith's task. Ellis, who shined in last year's Lovecraft Country, also holds her own as the mother who will be damned to be left out of any of her children's future decisions, nearly steals the film out from under Smith.",King Richard
579,11,masonsaul,Incredible sports drama,9/10,24 November 2021,"Even though it follows a very familiar formula, King Richard is an incredible sports drama that's heartwarming, tense and emotional. Will Smith gives an incredible lead performance that's definitely one of his all time best. Aunjanue Ellis, Saniyya Sidney, Demi Singleton, Tony Goldwyn and Jon Bernthal are all great. Reinaldo Marcus Green's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The soundtrack is really good and the music by Kris Bowers is excellent.

580,12,rgkarim,A King's Legacy Crammed Into Too Little Time:,7/10,20 November 2021,"LIKESThe Sports Moments:
While not campy like the Mighty Ducks, and certainly not as complete as movies like Hoosiers or Miracle, King Richard is a movie whose sports scenes are worthy of watching. Tennis matches may seem repetitive, but the film does a great job of showing off highlighted matches to give enough of the historical starts of the Williams sisters. The ending bout especially has some key moments, and though I would have liked a little more time in the match, or some adlibbing to make good volley moments that sports dram do well. Still, the movie gives enough of the sports feel to spice things up and break up the other dramatic elements.The Cinematography:
It's beautiful, and I agree with the way they have captured the moments of King Richard's plan into the modern day cinema. A blend of old footage, acts as fun launching the film to recreate history once again. The angles chosen to depict those key moments, with dynamic camera work keeping up with the chaos of life. It has filters and lighting to really bring out the feels of the family, and continues to fluctuate as the movie requires. When you see the setting and how they've taken us back to the decades where the girls were growing up, you are pulled further into the story and a bit distracted from some of the liberties taken in the film.The Story:
Again, the liberties taken in this movie I am not sure of, but the movie shows a lot of heart about a man whose principles were very limiting, but also inspirational in the goals designed. Richard may not have been the best parent, but his tale has a lot of gut wrenching moments in both the positive and negative aspects. This film shows you the layers of the Williams' father, all the turmoil that he held and why he pushed them as far as they did. The character centric plot gradually fleshes out insight into his checkered past, giving you perspectives from all the people this ""stubborn man"" put them through in his quest to make his plans a reality. Many of the secondary characters got their due time on the film, and those avenues were smart to continue to renew the investment into the tale. An even smarter decision was the intermittent shift to Venus' side of the story, and getting to see her feelings and views during the key elements were pretty cool for me. Her story never swallowed or took too much away from the main story, but instead threaded easily through it and picked up the energy and pace as Richard's story started to get repetitive. This helped keep the 2.5 hours from feeling too long and drawn out.The Politics Are Controlled:
I'll admit it gets preachy and a little in your face with the dialogue and certain scenes. However, King Richard was not the worse agenda pushing piece to come to the theater in the recent years. There are really inspirational moments, and some great comedy moments they use to fight the agenda, and many of them still hold the heart of Richard's journey to get his family the respect and stability they needed. It kept again the character at the center most of the time, and did a great job not diverting from that key story they were trying to tell us, which I'm greatly appreciative of letting the story tell the message instead of the in your face dialogue.The Acting:
Hands down the best part of the movie is the acting from so many members of the groups. The coaching staff, the other competitions, even the sisters who had a few lines sold me to the tight knit family the Williams were. However, the top billed cast is who I will focus on for the sake of time. Bernthal is the key coach you get in the movie and he rocks in the wide eyed coach, with dreams of making it big through his athlete's talents. A bit of jerk, which he plays well, Bernthal accomplishes the complex nature that this role held. Balancing precariously between potential antagonist and full on friend of the group, and I loved his energy in his goal to keep Richard from diverting too far with his plan. Ellis' role as the mother was amazing as well, the antithesis of Richard on some levels, while also playing the role of the faithful wife helping to support the family when Richard was focused on other parts. She's strong, she's bold, but she has that empowering presence that works super well for the role, if only I could have had more time with her. I have to say that Saniyya Sidney accomplished a lot in her role as young Venus, holding so much emotion and keeping it in check, with well-executed acting for most of the movie. She resonated with everyone in this group, and her and Smith's chemistry was an entropy favoring reaction that I would love to see again. As for Smith, again the man has proven his acting chops and the mantle of the ""king"" was a good fit for me upon watching him. One part emotional blend, one part comedy, and fantastic mimicry of the Williams patriarch, Smith's ability to take the inspirational and the mannerisms and blend them into a fun, yet serious, role worked for me. I enjoyed watching the obsessive nature of Richard emerge with each new venture, and Smith's evolution of the character was great as he never lost touch with Richard's core personality traits. Certainly an Oscar worthy performance from this reviewer.DISLIKES:The Pace At Times:
While most of the movie goes at smooth pace, there are times where the tangential paths were not the right tangents to use for me. Richard had a bunch of stuff to unleash, and when trying to balance Venus' tale into the mix, it leads to some inconsistent pace that feels a little bloated. A minor complaint, and one that is minimal once the exciting things come up.More Tennis Scenes Would Have Been Nice:
Again it's a sports movie according to the genre, and I'd have liked a few more moments of movie magic to spice up the game scenes that we got. Certainly the final match of the movie had that, but there were some other ones that could have used a little intervention to give me the excitement other sports movies have accomplished. This might have helped break up the slower pace for me, and give a little more room for the sound editing, cinema, and Sidney's work to elevate further.Lots of Story Sort of Skimmed over:
The story is about King Richard, and for much of the film we have been given insights into the hardships he faced and the actions he did. Sadly, Richard's story still feels skimmed and incomplete from what they could have been. All the stories of the past could have been done in either flashbacks or shown earlier in the movie, or perhaps a better execution of his talks to the girls about the horrors he faced. His checkered past being reduced to a few sentences and I can't say how this would have been better without more time or a second movie to paint his life with. Richard lived a lot of stuff and this movie again did a decent job hitting the highlights, but it's not the most complete story of the bunch.The Character Usage:
Again, bravo for the connections and the things they presented in this film with the actors mentioned above. King Richard though advertises that both sisters get the fair shot in the game, but really it's only Venus' tale that gets most of the focus. Richard's interactions with much of the family he promoted has those key moments in monologues, there are other components that I wish I had more time with. The oldest daughter and her strives to academia, the other two daughters sort of falling into the unknown, which may reflect what is seen today, but still would have been nice to see more of. I wanted to again see more of his wife's involvement, seeing her coaching the girls as we got glimpses at the beginning of the movie. Even more shots of her working in the shadows while he continued his drive would have been great or maybe more into the family trying to make their way during the non-tennis moments could have helped alleviate the bare use of the other characters. This was again especially true of Sarena's tale, an interesting story itself, but again glazed over in an odd choice of a few key moments and promises that either indicate a sequel or meant to put a nod to how much he was working on her plan. I don't know, but I'd have liked again more time to balance the two sisters and the father, (the people on the poster) to really deliver on the promises the trailer made.The VERDICT:King Richard accomplishes much in its two and half hour runtime with quality that is certainly geared towards the Oscars. It's got fantastic sound and video quality, using both in an artistic approach that really adds finesse and atmosphere to the story of the Williams' father. It's got heart, tells a tale of heart, and shows a dramatic dive into a man's legacy to make his family's life better. The acting is sensational, chemistry key in many of the interactions, but Smith certainly pulls out a lot of quality cards in his latest leading role. Yet, the movie is another big promise of a lot of stories being represented fairly, and the potential for a good sports movie mixed in. King Richard's tale is sort of like that in this film, but does not quite deliver on all fronts to make a consistent quality film balancing all of these into a short time frame. There was much to still learn about this man, requiring a read by yours truly of his history, but this movie does a decent job getting things started. The portrayal is still incredible though and when balancing everything in this drama, alongside still needing some more sports moments, I give this film:Biography/Drama/Sport: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.",King Richard
581,13,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of King Richard,7/10,24 November 2021,"2021's King Richard refers to Richard Williams. He's the pseudo architect behind the success of tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams. King Richard is not always about Mr. Williams though. It's about Venus too. Serena? Well she takes a back seat even though she's now regarded as the greatest female to ever swing a racket (something Richard declared circa 1994).King Richard is probably the greatest tennis movie ever. That's not saying a whole lot because I've only seen five of them and three have been bad (Jocks, Players, Wimbledon). King Richard is also light on its feet (no pun intended), has a pep in its step, and is full of jovial energy. The film could be a little more compelling however. I mean it doesn't reach those kinds of heights except in the first act (trying to practice some down-the-line shots in a seedy area of Compton, CA).King Richard from a technical advisor standpoint, is pretty darn good. The tennis matches are well shot and you don't get that overwhelming feeling of CGI (remember Paul Bettany's Peter Colt trying to flex his forehand on those grass courts?). King Richard also blew me away with the casting of Saniyya Sidney as Venus Williams. Sidney's backhand looks pretty much identical to the one the actual Venus used to rip winners crosscourt. If you don't believe me just check the almighty YouTube.As a true story drama that would be worthwhile viewing for any aspiring tennis prod, King Richard feels somewhat unfinished even at 145 minutes. It doesn't really have a beginning and it ends about 3-4 years before the Williams sisters were ready to rule the tennis world. King Richard also suffers a little from being technically trite (I'm referring to the professional advice of the tennis teacher personas in the movie). Still, I can't help but recommend it.King Richard has great performances from three actors in Jon Bernthal (he plays tennis guru Rick Macci), Aunjanue Ellis (she plays Richard's wife Oracene), and Will Smith (he plays of course, Richard Williams). Smith is the standout here and deserves to be recognized by the Academy. He completely disappears into character just like he did in 2006's The Pursuit of Happyness. Heck, back then the Fresh Prince never stood a chance.",King Richard
582,14,rannynm,A heart-warming bio-drama film about family and perseverance,10/10,15 November 2021,"King Richard is a heart-warming bio-drama film about family and perseverance that will inspire the world! Director Reinaldo Marcus Green and Writer Zach Baylin deliver a great film about achieving the impossible when you don't give up. It's based on the true story about tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams and how they rose to fame and the role their father played. Tennis fans are sure to love this, but anyone that loves inspirational films will appreciate it.King Richard follows the journey of Richard Williams (Will Smith), the father and coach of famed tennis players Serena Williams (Demi Singleton) and Venus Williams (Saniyya Sydney). It shows how, even without having a background in the sport, poor equipment, outdated tennis courts, and limited financial resources, he was able to guide his daughters' careers and turn them into some of the best athletes in the history of tennis. Williams was an undeterred, driven father with a clear vision and plan to turn his girls into talented superstars using his own unusual methods.The main characters are Richard Williams, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Demi Singleton, Oracene 'Brandy' Williams (Aunjanue Ellis), Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn) and Rick Macci (Jon Bernthal). While this film is two hours long, you can't tell due to the amazing writing and the hilarious comedic delivery of two-time Oscar winner, Will Smith. You will experience many emotions while watching this film - pride, inspiration, sadness and happiness. My favorite part was watching the family support each other by making the best decisions for the overall family, whether it was getting mentors for Venus and Serena or just figuring out how to survive and strive in everyday life. The music is amazing and Beyonce's feature song ""Be Alive"" really sums up the journey the girls went through on their rise to the top.The message throughout King Richard is to never give up and believe in yourself and your family, no matter your circumstances or background. The Williams' sisters came from a rough neighborhood and their family didn't have the money and resources needed to properly train them, but did not let that stop them from working hard and eventually dominating the world of tennis. Their father, Richard Williams, had a dream and a plan and he stuck to it. He also taught his family to dream big, despite any obstacles. Parents should be aware that there is mild violence.I rate King Richard 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 18, plus adults. King Richard serves up in theaters November 19, 2021 and on HBO Max for 30 days after the theatrical release. By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",King Richard

Still, I went to see this & thought it wasn't bad afterwards.The film follows King Richard, a die hard Tennis player & a father to 5 daughters, 2 of which aspire to be World Tennis Champions. They must work hard & push to make their way to the top, though challenges & conflict with their stubborn father arise as they start to get attention.I found the film to be good, the story keeps you interested as the film progresses. The scenes were good, the script was alright & the actors all done well with the parts with a feel good theme throughout.I will say however, the film dragged in a lot of areas & the runtime is overly long a 2 hours & 18 minutes.Overall, it's not a bad film & it's a good watch despite dragging & being long.7/10.",King Richard
584,16,drjgardner,Good film,7/10,21 November 2021,"This is a good sports film and has lots of revealing information about the Williams family that most people will not be aware of. Remarkably, Will Smith puts aside his constant need to show himself off and gets absorbed into the personality of the Williams' father.. All the acting is great, especially the 5 girls and the mom. Of course the film is from the POV of the Dad and I imagine there are other viewpoints. I was disappointed that given the emphasis on the Dad, when the film ends and they give a summary of what happened after, nothing is mentioned about the Dad. That makes no sense in the context of the film.

585,17,Movi3DO,Incredible,9/10,25 November 2021,"We're going to shake up this world.Man did they rock the world. A biopic about Richard Williams, who had plans and visions for his two daughters, Venus and Serena, to become the best tennis players in the world.Let me just say this first: kudos to Richard Williams. He can be a very stubborn and hard to talk to man, but the visions and trusts that he had for his children were unparalleled. Not that many parents, regardless of race, have such confidence for their children, so I say that King Richard's work is incredible indeed.Then we have Will Smith who portrayed the man. Will was amazing in capturing what the character is about. His performance and the real-life phenomena that is Richard Williams made the movie fascinating and enjoyable from start to finish.This led to a problem with the movie, which was that it followed many of the steps in biopic genre, so certain scenes were predictable. However, I was still invested in the movie because of the uniqueness of the character.Another aspect that was interesting about the character was his moral code. Even though he wanted his daughters to be great players, he still placed important values like family, representation, and giving back to the community before the sport. The struggles that he faced as well as his clash with many characters, including his wife, made the movie all the more worth investing.Overall, an amazing story with strong performance throughout. 8.5-9/10.",King Richard
586,18,Alexander_Blanchett,Great work,9/10,29 November 2021,"A real class act of sports cinema. Its a great, touching biopic that was able to put shivers down my spin a lot of times.The fact that it was produced by the two Williams sisters make it even more precious as it seems to be the way it was. Its a great film about two truly legendary sports women and their legend making father.Fathers in sports have always the reputation to put too much pressure on their kids and no doubt Richard Williams was no different, but the way he was portrayed in the film showed both sides of the coin.Will Smith is fabulous in the leading role and gives one of his finest performances to date. No doubt he will generate a lot of awards with this one. He really soaked himself into that role that indeed from the very very second he appears on screen up to the last you never see Big Willy on screen, but the character he plays with so much heart and soul.Aunjanue Ellis is also fantastic and has many, many brilliant moments. She surely should not be underrated for this great performance she gave which is up to the level of Smith's great work even though her role is way more subtle but she has so much to say the way she plays it.The two girls are also fantastic and absolutely realistic. Good direction, fantastic score and many good editing decisions make this a truly fine film and one of the best of the year.It really makes me want to have some kind of a sequel to see the later years of the girls. Would have made a fantastic mini series, too. But as a film its a great piece of love, ambition and trust.",King Richard

If you love cinema, if you adore sports, if you believe in impossible dreams, this is for you.One of the best feel-good films I've seen in a long, long time. An important story to show to our kids and a fantastic work overall (direction, editing, cinematograph...even all the details putting us on the right period of time). The only thing I didn't love was the ending. Yeah, it's emotional, but I wanted 15 more minutes. I think we - and they - deserved that.It's incredible what Will Smith does here. He is not Will Smith, he is King Richard from the very first moment. So powerful, so charismatic, so real! But it's also good to praise the fact that the film let other stars to shine, it's not a one-man film. Aunjanue Ellis is really strong in all the film, being the balance to Richard's craziness, while Saniyya Sidney does a fantastic job as Venus, one of the best supportig teen roles I've seen in a while.Last but not least, this is a very special testimony about perseverance, about having a plan, about believing and about fighting against all the adversities. The racism is, of course, present (it could have been even more) and the obvious and the less-obvious messages are always there to remind us like they are still always there reminding the Williams family, even if they are one of the most successful families in history.PS: That Oscar is coming for Beyoncé.

This left me feeling a little worried and I set my expectations suitably low, but I needn't have worried as King Richard is a terrific film.When watching a sports movie I want it to be uplifting, powerful, emotional, heartwarming, and engaging. King Richard gave me all off this and more. It has a brilliant story which is well told with solid pacing and strong character exploration.The performance from Will Smith was one of his best, truly remarkable. Saniyya Sidney in the role of Venus Williams was a revelation and is definitely a name to watch. She completely stole the show at times.While there isn't anything particularly flashy in the way of the direction it is very solid.Overall this is a fantastic watch. So tense, surprisingly funny and with a powerful and uplifting story. A great film worthy of the Williams' epic legacy.",King Richard

590,22,coombsstephen,Another Will Smith master class but a bit predictable,7/10,8 November 2021,"There were no surprises in this film, even though it's real life, it pans out exactly as most people would predict, almost the pursuit of happiness meets tennis.However it's a good formula and a story well worth telling. Part of me did wonder, in this film, just how much air brushing the harder edges of history had been done.What makes the film though is another brilliant performance from Will Smith, he just makes the film again.

592,24,Lewis_Heather787,Educational,8/10,28 November 2021,"It's funny, I was actually not really looking forward to watching this film. That is mainly because I'm not a fan of the Williams sisters as athletes. They have been the main reason as to why I have never been interested in women's tennis because of their domination of it. So I should be here now destroying this film and hating it, however I was pleasantly shocked at how brilliant and educational this film is. If you love sports films, check this out 100% because you'll love it.That is my main take away from this film, learning new information about the sisters whether that be, their childhood, early career and of course their father. It probably helped that I didn't know anything whatsoever about Venus and Serena's introduction to the sport and how influential their father Richard was in their development. It was extremely eye opening and makes you realise the commitment, persistence and effort that someone has to put in to become a professional athlete.......especially at such a young age.I'm gonna say it now, give Will Smith the best actor Oscar now !!! Maybe that is over the top having just seen the film however I thought he was absolutely brilliant in the role of Richard Williams. Every single scene he is in, which is most of them, I was glued too. It makes my brain hurt though, that Smith can deliver a performance like this one and then he'll go do some awful action film. Please stop doing crappy garbage action films and just stick to drama etc.........he so much better suited to it now he is that much older.The whole cast was brilliant !!! Saniyya Sydney, Demi Singleton, Tony Goldwyn and of course Jon Bernthal were just all great.......their performances completed the film to me.I have one minor issue with the film. Although I was glued to the screen for the majority I do think that this film could have been cut down ever so slightly.....I think 2 hours 30 is pushing it.Overall though I am shocked at how much I throughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. Plus the fact that I learnt a hell of a lot of information about the Williams sister that I didn't know. Makes you appreciate their success more although it may not change my mind about rooting for them haha. 80% out of 100.",King Richard
593,25,nidhunmoviebuff,The best sports drama of 2021!,8/10,20 November 2021,"2-time Academy Award nominee and National treasure Will Smith lights up 2021 with the best sports drama of the year! King Richard is an immensely enjoyable and hard-hitting tale of a father hell bent on helping his girls achieve their maximum potential and instilling in them immense confidence in their own abilities and a never-say-die attitude.Smith stars as the flamboyant, often outspoken Richard Williams, the father of the legendary Williams sisters, regarded as the greatest ever siblings to ever lift a racquet. If you have caught the real life 'King Richard' during his famous interviews and press tours, you can easily comprehend the level of detailing and thought Will Smith has put behind his pin-point portrayal of the famous dad/coach, down to even
his Compton accent, body language and mannerisms.Smith has clearly put his heart and soul behind the character, and it reflects on screen as one never gets to see Will Smith the global superstar, but a worried, over-protective and vulnerable dad who will stop at nothing to shield his talented daughters from the perils and pitfalls of stardom and celebrity.Director Reinaldo Marcus Green has got his casting spot on with the girls portraying 2 of Tennis' biggest names-Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton-stealing the show. Not only do they excel in the tennis sequences but also steal our hearts by their tender and heartwarming character portrayals. The duo's depiction of the toil, hardwork and struggle behind becoming the sports biggest names is a joy to behold in itselfThe humane side of the Williams' family journey is covered in pain-staking detail-How they battled their way through poverty and a crime-infested neighborhood to conquer a sport that was traditionally dominated by the privileged classes.But in doing so, the director never falters from giving us detailed tennis sequences, with the cinematography from Robert Elswit capturing each rally and point with precision.Aunjanue Ellis, who is primarily known for her TV roles, delivers her career best performance as the girls' headstrong mother, dominating even her combination scenes with Will Smith. This performance should definitely open more doors to more impactful Hollywood roles for this talented actress. Jon Bernthal also shines in a supporting role, as the eccentric and loud-mouthed real-life coach 'Rick Macci'Director Reinaldo Marcus Green, the genius behind Monsters and Men (2018), delivers a stellar visual experience, choosing an unconventional narrative style as compared to traditional sports dramas. The entire narrative is from the superstar players' dad's perspective, capturing the essence of the man behind the girls' legendary rise to fame. From Compton right to the hallowed courts of Wimbledon!With a performance arguably even better than his landmark roles in Ali (2001) and The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), Will Smith powers this captivating sports drama. I will be very surprised if this doesn't earn him a Best Actor Nomination at the next Oscars. What a riveting performance!Highly recommended!",King Richard
594,26,Avwillfan89,Smith serves!,8/10,20 November 2021,"Being a huge fan of Will Smith, I've literally been waiting years for him to make a good movie again. And finally after all this time, he's taken on the role of the patriarch of the Williams family that includes two of the most successful female tennis players of all time: Venus and Serena.The biopic itself is nothing particularly special, and I would have liked to have had more POVs from the two sisters, since they are the ones who went on to become the world champions in the end.But still, the acting is really what makes the film work. And a central performance by Will Smith, the best he's been in over a decade, as this pig headed, determined father who will do anything for his daughters' success, growth and confidence, that really does carry the entire film.I was worried that the movie would portray him as a saintly figure and would gloss over most of his flaws. But in a few argument scenes involving the girls's coach Macci and Richard's wife Brandi, you get a much more three dimensional character who is neither godlike, nor a total devil.I don't know a thing about tennis. But my dad used to play a lot when I was growing up. There is a scene involving Richard breaking down while giving an empowering speech to Venus that just made me burst into tears. My own father didn't always support me in many things the way Richard did with his kids. And it really cuts to the core themes of the film: Fatherhood, support and making others proud.",King Richard

Jon Bernthal on the other hand was also exceptional....his reactions when decisions don't go his way made me laugh the whole time. This movie is an inspirational movie that needs to be enjoyed by the family.....very well done.

597,29,jace_the_film_guy,Chill-Inducing,8/10,27 November 2021,"As a fan of the sport, I absolutely loved this film. The screenplay took the great source material and showcases the brilliance of the Williams' sisters' story. With dedicated acting and excellent casting, this is a film bound to be nominated for multiple Academy awards. The actual tennis scenes were chill-inducing and there were more than a few moments that brought tears to my eyes.Richard's arrogance and stubbornness (especially halfway through the film) contradicted the humble message he preached to his girls and left a sour taste in my mouth. That being said, the message at the core of the film of hard-work, drive and having a plan for success helped me move past my frustrations.A solid film about modern legends, King Richard has jumped into my personal top 10 films about sports.

600,32,cdjh-81125,Undeniably Familiar But Extremely Effective,8/10,20 November 2021,"Sports movies like King Richard tend to be a bit hit and miss for me. I think that's in large part due to the fact that I've never been an athlete myself and have never had any real interest in sports as a whole. So in order for a film like this to work for me the characters need to be there for me to be invested. Movies like The Fighter and I, Tonya excelled in this department and that's what made me love them. While I don't think King Richard is as good as either of those films I really enjoyed it despite some slightly generic storytelling.Probably one of my biggest unpopular movie opinions is that I've never really seen the appeal of Will Smith. I think he's an undeniably capable actor but I think he's fallen into doing the same thing in almost every performance he gives and whenever he tries something different the scripts he chooses usually don't meet his efforts. So I'm very happy to say that I loved him in this movie and I think it is the best performance I've ever seen him give. It was a refreshingly quiet performance that didn't have an overload of loud, unnecessary emotional scenes just for the sake of it. When ever the character shows more emotion I always felt it was earned and it was more fulfilling as a result. If he takes home an Oscar for this role I will not be disappointed. Beyond Smith I also loved Ellis and Bernthal, the latter of which gives a refreshingly against type performance. Demi Singleton and Saniyya Sidney were phenomenal as Venus and Serena, they really held there own against Smith and I never felt as though the film took away focus from them in order to give more screen time to the titular Richard.I also felt that the film was very well presented technically. The cinematography was great, it's extremely well edited and I really thought Reinaldo Marcus Green did a fantastic job with his direction. As a result this never felt like a generic Oscar-bait biopic but instead a true passion project in which everyone brought their A game. I also felt that the script was pretty solid, if a bit generic in places. I really like how the film isn't afraid to criticise it's own main character, in many ways it's left up to the audience to decide how they feel about him and it felt refreshingly nuanced as a resuly when it easily could've came across as a puff piece of Richard. That being said though I do think the script does adhere too closely to a formula that films of this genre are known for. In many ways it was fairly predictable to see what direction the film was going in and I think it suffers from an abrupt halt in the second act when there is a drastic change in location that did cause that sequence to drag quite a bit for me. As I said though the most important thing in a film like this is that I care about the characters I definitely did so I wouldn't say any of these issues stopped me from enjoying King Richard as much as I did.King Richard doesn't exactly break new ground from a story perspective and I'd be lying if I didn't say that the overlong runtime caused some portions to drag for me but at the end of that day I cared about the main characters and that made all the difference. Will Smith has never been better and I loved the entire supporting cast, I think the technical presentation ism great and despite it's cliches the film overall worked for me. Sometimes it's just nice to see an inspiring story put to screen and King Richard definitely delivered that.8.4/10 - A- (Fantastic)",King Richard

602,34,evilnigga,Somewhat boring,5/10,24 November 2021,"Richard is shown as an imperious loudmouth and other times they constantly reminding us how genius his plan is, they do show his good side but more so on the bad side. In the end we see a refinement in his character but only for a brief and it doesn't do justice to what really happened. All around great performances, though Will's may be overdone and Jon Bernthal's performance was surprisingly great. Often times the movie went into a moment of boredom when they elongated a conflict then repeat that said conflict 15 minutes later. The rest was filled with training montages with music you'd expect from a sport movie. It has an incredibly story yet somehow boredom prevails.

Although the movie has a spotlight on the Williams sisters (mostly Venus and hardly Serena), it is neither about them, nor about tennis. It's about Richard Williams and therefore, if you go in expecting intense tennis matches or hoping to learn their careers, you'll find something missing.The movie also throws light on parenthood, life while dealing with racism, etc. Someone needs to give Will Smith an Oscar already. High time. The child-actors were brilliant too.

606,38,christophershobris,Smith is Amazing,9/10,29 November 2021,"Some might call this ""The Will Smith Show,"" but I'd call it a world class, top of the line, king of the crop performance that I knew Smith was capable of pulling off. After years of film after film failing to execute on the greatness that Smith possesses finally this film showed me what a powerhouse Smith can be in any given role. This is by far the greatest performance I've seen in Smith's entire career that includes ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" He portrays Richard Williams with the grace, and determined attitude the man conveyed. Will Smith disappeared into the role. I didn't see Will Smith portraying Richard Williams, I saw Richard Williams. A true example of raw talent that was held back for so long, I'm just happy to see Smith really show his true talent and it is limitless. The great thing about this film is also that Smith isn't the only thing that makes this film shine brightly. The cinematography and the lighting in this film is absolutely brilliant. There was always this hue and the colors weren't always the brightest, but very hazy and dusty. It felt like I was in the time period the film is set in. The choice to cast unknown young actresses to play Venus & Serena Williams was a smart one, it made it easier for them to own the role and made me believe I was really watching Venus & Serena. The director did a really good job at making sure the film stayed focused on being about tennis and the development of the Williams' sisters and found a way to make it interesting and engaging. Mrs. Ellis who plays Richard's wife is given the most pedestrian role, but she manages to keep up with the others and holds her own in many scenes. She did such a good job I actually remember her character and her importance to the overall story, even if she wasn't on screen as much as her husband. Jon Bernthal who appears unrecognizable also blends in with his character, and too gives a worthy performance and showed Bernthal is ready for the next phase of his career, which is to prove he can carry a starring role in a major film. The costuming is perfect, and captures the time period which complements the cinematography. The only nit-pick I have is the unnecessary involvement of the young punks that intimidate Richard. It didn't really go anywhere other than to show why Richard is so determined to make his daughters tennis greats so they don't have to endure the suffering he had to. But this element of the film just suddenly comes to a halt after a final short confrontation. Then Richard and the punks become allies after this altercation. But once that's out of the way, the film focuses on what the film is about and that is tennis and the fight Richard had to provide Venus & Serena with the best chance to thrive and survive. I can't recommend this film enough. If you like Will Smith, a heartfelt sport drama, phenomenal acting, beautiful cinematography and costumes, and one minor story hindrance, I hope you see it. 9.8/10.",King Richard

608,40,Mike_O_Dwyer,Mediocre. Flat. Uninspiring.,4/10,22 November 2021,"That the film is called King Richard should serve as a warning to anyone expecting this to be about two of the greatest athletes tennis has ever seen.This is a film about Will Smith playing an old man. He mumbles. He shuffles about. He gets beat up. He does dad jokes. He's the most annoying thing in the film. Which is a pity.The film only really comes alive when the story focuses on Venus and Serena. Saniyya Sidney's oozes confidence as Venus and you believe everything she says when she talks about what she wants to achieve. Demi Singleton, as Serena, is equally good as a foil for Sidney to bounce off.The most telling scenes involve Aunjanue Ellis as the girls' mother, Oracene 'Brandy' Williams, when she stands up to Richard making decisions without involving her or the girls, and puts him in his box when his prideful self-importance as the sole reason the girls got to where they get to becomes an overbearing delusion that whitewashes his well documented flaws.You come out of the film thinking that Queen Oracene would make a much more interesting film given that she has to overcome the film's biggest obstacle: Will Smith.",King Richard

610,42,pronitmallick,A well put together game,7/10,20 November 2021,"King Richard is a movie that in the start feels like a rough game that slowly gets smoothed out after a few strokes. Pacing, from start to the end feels stretched at a few spots but the overall run keeps everyone on their seats. One of the things in the film that shines quite bright among others is the performance of all the actors. It's not something that only attracts our attention but also fills us with a bucket of emotions, and the credit goes from Will Smith to Jon Bernthal to everyone else. The screenplay and stuff seems like they could have gotten a little more polishing but all in all it stays good and makes the audience want more of it. Talking about the story-telling it may seem like a few ups and downs but director Reinaldo Marcus Green has put enough effort and elements in the back to not just create a good presentation but also to create a good overall harmony. In the end it's a well put together movie that can become a part of anyone's watchlist for the weekend.

612,44,dogonlion,BRAVO!,10/10,23 November 2021,"Ok, I've never been a fan of Will Smith's. I actually always said he was one of the luckiest men alive. Except for Fresh Prince of Bel Air which is a more natural role for him to play, I never understood his success. I've even laughed when his name was mentioned about the Oscars. I enjoyed Pursuit of happiness and thought he did good there. I hated Ali and thought he did ok in Concussion even if I thought they could have picked a different actor that looked like the real life man he was playing the role of. I just finished watching King Richard and wow, I think he actually did it. This might win him an Oscar and I will be cheering. What a great performance! This movie is just a great movie all around. Biopics are hard to do and I'm usually disappointed by them but this is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. It's up there with Ray. I tip my hat to the directors and every single actor and actress in it.

This biopic film sets up the origin success of Venus and Serena Williams. Everyone knows that it's not easy becoming a star athlete. It takes a lot of training, heartbreak, blood, sweat, and tears. ""King Richard"" shows how much their father wanted them to succeed and reach the highest peaks of the tennis world.I was genuinely surprised by how much emotion the actors brought to the film. I won't lie I was a little iffy on what Will Smith would bring. I should know by now not to doubt him as most movies I've seen him in I haven't been disappointed. Even though we know where the stars are today it was still heartbreaking to see failure, but it was also exuberating to see their early success. I found myself pumping my fist in cheer to a point being won. That's how fun this film was.There's no real convincing anyone to see this film. If you enjoy tennis and/or biopics I think you'll enjoy this one. It was worth the watch in theatres, but it's not a necessity.",King Richard
616,48,mickman91-1,A simple movie with tried and tested storyline but done well enough to be very enjoyable for one viewing. Great for tennis fans as lots of attention to tennis detail,7/10,26 November 2021,"One of the best tennis movies. It is clear that the actresses studied tennis and tried to imitate Venus' serve etc. There was also attention to detail in the casting and makeup and Will Smith did a really good impersonation of Richard Williams. I imagine he will be up for the Oscar nomination, this is the type of Hollywood movie with a message that the Academy loves. The message being of rags to riches, focused on their race of course. So in this way it was very predictable. But the journey was enjoyable nevertheless. It is quite a long film however it is paced well because I remained engaged throughout. There is probably quite a bit of filler though, however without as much time spent with the characters you may not have bought into their journey and ultimate success as much. This is quite an achievement considering everyone knows the story of the Williams' sisters success, and it is not a story filled with heightened drama that you would think is conducive to a Hollywood movie. It is just a simple movie about belief and vision and hard work and support, but done well. Not a film you need to watch twice but for one viewing it is very good. I am a fan of tennis though and know about the historical context of the events and the names mentioned etc. If you aren't a fan of tennis i'm not sure if that would make things a bit different.",King Richard
617,49,ACollegeStudent,Not sure how much of this is fact/fiction but Richard was unbelievably toxic,6/10,23 November 2021,"Rating: 6.9For the most part the film was alright, but in the second half Richard went from humble guy trying to make his daughters dreams come true, to gaslighting obnoxious egotistical father warping the entire story into his success story. It's hard to judge this because I don't know if the real Richard was like this or if the writers are just playing it up for drama's sake. But it was difficult to root for a guy who gaslit people like: Rick macci (the whole contract fiasco Richard changed last minute), to follow his plan. Richard was also insufferable with how he treated those around his daughters (interviewers), constantly yelling at them for being too provocative like bro can you handle anything like a professional? All in all, decent film with an insufferable male lead.",King Richard
618,50,severindringel,You just have to feel good after watching this.,8/10,24 November 2021,"Who doesn't love it, a feel-good sports drama based on the true story of the rise of two exceptional athletes in their field. Venus and Serena Williams are the American figureheads of tennis and were predestined for this path even before they were born. Their father Richard Williams played a big part in this, putting together a ready-made plan for the two of them early on to make them the players they are today.The interesting thing about King Richard is that it is not primarily about the two sisters, who are shown bleeding young in the deep origins of both their lives. Rather, it is about the title character Richard, their loving yet strict father, whose parenting methods and sheer passion for his daughters the film brings closer and explores in detail. No one, but really no one, could have played this role better than the Fresh Prince himself, Will Smith. At the latest when I saw the clips of the Williams sisters' childhood in the after credits, it was clear that Smith was transforming into the persona Richard Williams. This is impressive in that you spend the entire film watching not the actor Will Smith, after all one of the most popular celebs of today's generation, but a subtle and empathetic father struggling with his own flaws. Richard may be on fire for his girls and subordinate everything else in his life to them, but he acts selfishly and incomprehensibly in places. Sometimes it seems as if he is only striving to feel validated in what he is doing, rather than doing it for the well-being of his daughters. He also often acts over-sensitively and blocks the aspiring Venus from several years of her later brilliant career. Smith delivers a near-perfect performance, with quite a lot of depth, multi-dimensionality and emotion. In the scenes where Smith only lets his eyes do the talking, I got irresistible goosebumps. Possibly his most impressive career performance, or at least the best for many years. The rest of the cast complement the lead role of Richard with flying colours. They all are confronted with his stubbornness and unpredictability. Jon Bernthal as a slightly hyper coach, once again flourishes in a supporting role. Aunjanue Ellis as Richard's wife Brandi, who thrills in interpersonal scenes, or the young actresses Demi Singleton (Serena) and Saniyya Sidney (Venus), who fill the big shoes of the tennis icons with the finest precociousness.Besides the brilliant cast, King Richard brings everything a film like this has to deliver. Optimistic music, bright and contrasting images and scenes that exude their own magic. In this respect, I hardly noticed the crass running time of just under 2 ½ hours, especially the tennis sequences at the end were too exciting for that. What the film does not do is revolutionise the genre or be original. For a sports film, it is very standard and does not take any big risks. It's also a bit of a shame that the focus is much more on Venus and I felt like Richard was favouring his older daughter. Also, as so often in these films, the theme of the underdog is clearly a focus. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green is responsible for the feel-good film of the year that we all want and need.",King Richard

620,52,frank-liesenborgs,Was not interested but took my change. And what a movie!!!,8/10,24 November 2021,"Went to see the movie without any expectation at all. But oh boy, what a movie (story) this was/is. I saw the movie two days ago and am still thinking about all the issues touched in this movie, from pure and evil racism to a family with values difficult to grasp even today. But Richard was right, well, most of the time. No doubt about this movie. Yes it is a long movie but it is shorter than you think. A stellar performance of Will Smith, who is kind of getting used to play real life stories (Ali, Concussion, Pursuit of Happiness, Six Degrees of Separation and now this movie). This movie has a moral compass and makes you think about racial issues, studying, sport versus education, how a family deals with this, and last but not least the celebrity status they got. If this was not a real life story, I would never have believed the plot. We all know Venus and Serena, right? But now you get to know the man with the plan, Richard. And I still cannot believe it. How did he know? How could he keep the sponsors away until the time was right? Studying over sport knowing that Richard had two world champions? Not choosing the quick buck over the long time investment and doing all the thing in a controversial way? Just one word needed to describe this movie: mindboggling. You have to see this gem even if you do not like tennis (like me). Watch and you will not regret!",King Richard

I enjoyed King Richard but I may not see it again.King Richard is Oscar bait so the acting is great. I don't watch much Oscar bait so I haven't seen any movie like this with bad acting. Smith gives the best performance, he's Oscar worthy.King Richard is a feel good movie but its not sappy. The Williams and their struggles feel realistic. They live in a rough neighborhood which is quickly established. Them being Jehovah's Witnesses is a minor aspect but it grabbed my attention.King Richard is predictable but not extremely. I guess the real life story was more complex but the story isn't so cliche. Let's just say Richard is a loving but pushy father. The film is long but its well paced.Overall, King Richard is a good movie. If you like Will Smith, you should see it. If you're looking for a feel good movie, see it. Yes, its suitable for Witnesses.",King Richard
622,54,guskeller,One-note,7/10,20 November 2021,"Much like the character it studies, King Richard is motivational yet a bit tiresome. King Richard provides a charismatic and complex protagonist in Will Smith while also addressing important themes of racism, classism, and determination. So the film definitely deserves credit for marrying entertainment with enlightenment. However, King Richard falls short of excellence because there isn't much else to it. Yes, Smith is terrific, but not otherworldly enough to make a masterpiece on his own. Unfortunately, the experience eventually feels one-note after a while.First, the other characters are underwritten. Aunjanue Ellis excels with what she's given, but her scenes are sparse. Meanwhile, little time is spent on Venus and Serena as people. Obviously, King Richard is fundamentally about Richard Williams, but the supporting cast simply doesn't have much to work with. Next, there is the filmmaking, which is strictly adequate. The cinematography, editing, and sound design are plain with occasional highlights. None of these fronts are bad, but none are particularly engaging either. Really, the only significantly positive note outside of Smith is the soundtrack, which emphasizes the era and the climatic moments. Overall, King Richard is certainly good but lacks the complexity to be great.Writing: 7/10

It's truly stunning work on display here.The story doesn't always focus on Richard's growth the way that it should. There were several scenes covering parts of his life that I feel we're not nearly capitalised on in the way that they could have been. This could have been a much more compelling character piece than it was.That being said, the performances are so emotionally resonant and the direction so fluid that you can't help but get sucked into these characters' lives, hopes, and dreams.Definitely a cut above the average sports drama.

The real Mr. Williams was nothing like this, being a strict authoritarian with at least 15 children with at least 4 different women (including one younger than five of his children) and treated Venus and Serena like objects in their upbringing. Instead, he's portrayed in this film as a goofy kindly genius. There IS an inspiring story in these events, but its more of the ability of Venus and Serena to become (somewhat) functional people after being used by their father.

629,61,Zi_Reviews_Movies,Respect.,8/10,25 November 2021,"I had been eagerly waiting to see King Richard and I'm pleased to say, it did not disappoint. I didn't honestly know the backstory of the Williams Sisters and neither am I a tennis fan but I love a good biopic and it stars Will Smith. The movie taught me so much and I will always now see Venus and Serena in a renewed light. The movie is long and paced slowly but how else do you wish to see that incredible journey? It's incredibly detailed and filled with highs and lows, not a light watch I assure you.In a movie like this, I expect a tear to roll down my cheek but I'm disappointed to say no scene does that. Some parts made me extremely sad, some incredibly happy but none worthy of a cry. While Will Smith is commendable, Saniyya Sidney (Venus Williams) and Demi Singleton (Serena Williams) stole the show. I'm glad they chose to show the unpleasant side of things, how Richard Williams had his cons instead of sugar coating the entire thing. It's also an inspiring and motivating movie to anybody who is trying to make it, to build something and is planning for something greater. There's a lot to learn here. So many quotes to draw. Maybe it was all a part of Richard's plan.As I read, many of the scenes are based on events that actually happened, making the movie easier to digest. While I didn't shed a tear, I have a newfound respect for the Williams family, and yes the family not just Richard. Becoming legendary is not easy, but Richard planned and Venus and Serena achieved. Though it is also disheartening when you take a step back and look that his kids were nothing more than cash cows to him, the remark made by Aunjanue Ellis (Brandy Williams) hurts.Stay for the credits, it's worth it.",King Richard
630,62,Entertainmentsparadise,Will Smith does a terrific job encompassing the character of Richard Williams.,8/10,23 November 2021,"King Richard does a phenomenal job of storytelling. In an era of media, Black fathers are crucified for believing in their children and challenging them to reach their potential. This film displays overbearing parenting in a more positive light that dismisses the outlandish claims made previously.Suppose you have no idea who this Richard Williams is or Serena or Venus Williams is, do not fret because Richard ( Will Smith) will let you know any chance he gets. The film quickly immersed me into the plot, displaying Richards' determination to get his daughters to the next stage in their tennis careers. The film continues to leave no time for boredom by establishing vivid setting and climate while also informing us of the movie's mission -telling the story of how a father believed in his daughters.I was thoroughly engaged with the film depicting real-life issues the Williams family faced.For example, living in a rough neighborhood and low economic status was watered down to fit family viewing. Yet, it was necessary to focus on the plot. Just as Richards planned the Williams sisters' lives, everything in the film seems strategic.The film replicates the likeness of most characters to their real-life counterparts and some of the interview dialogue are from actual interviews incorporated in this film. While adding some quips such as ""ghetto Cinderella."" It's clear to see that they paid attention to detail.Will Smith does a terrific job encompassing the character of Richard Williams. From the accent, tone, mannerisms, and outrages justified outburst. It is clear to see Smith's brilliant range in another delightful film.Verdict: King Richard is based on a true story, showing the true beauty of believing in yourself and your children . I learned more about the Williams story, felt some emotion, and had a great time overall, especially given the movie is over 2 hours long. Worth the watch? I say yes!Does King Richard bring me to paradise? Yes! 4/5.",King Richard

The screenplay isn't compelling, the acting isn't great ... the timing is okay.It's a good enough film to do chores by.

Will smith did a good job playing Richard and looked kinda like him and i'm a fan of tennis and been playing it since i was a teenager.

634,66,FilmFlowCritics,Awesome Will meets mediocre movie,7/10,21 October 2021,"This movie looks like it was written for Will Smith. The script fits him so well. He can show off hs comedic style as well as the serious drama bits. Oscar nomination guaranteed.Where this movie makes you laugh and entertains you while Will is in it, thats also its biggest weakness. I've seen it a week ago and I cant remember any scene, where WIll wasnt in it, thats dangerous for the movie and its plot.Personally I wish it would have shown the journey of the WIlliams sisters even more into their later career stage, but this movie is NOT really about them, its about King Richard!

635,67,dklecan,Couldn't stop watching,9/10,29 November 2021,"I was Not that interested in watching a movie of a bullying parent scream and yell at his kids to succeed at all cost. And, yes, it was difficult to watch an unlikeable character for a couple of hours. But the incredible acting chops of everyone involved was top notch, and once I started I couldn't turn it off.My favorite scene is when he accepts Bernthal's contract for, not just the girls, but the entire Williams family to go to Florida to train....the ride through my home state, where they try to spell Albuqueruque made me laugh and cry....bringing back memories of my families road trips through the west....., talking , laughing...we never needed stupid car games or ipads/videos to keep us entertained.King Richard's story is inspiring.....His push for education, family unity, family love, and overcoming all the challenges and obstacles of being the first minority to open and walk through the gates of the white man's world is not an easy one, and it takes a unique and strong person to do.",King Richard
636,68,nlsteven-attheMovies,Father Knows Best,8/10,24 November 2021,"Will Smith delivers a tour de force performance in this engaging family drama as the overbearing father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams. It's a beautifully shot film with strong performances overall. My only gripe is that this is not a biopic about the Williams sisters. Instead the film chooses to focus on its main star - Will Smith - as the helicopter parent. Venus Williams gets some screen time on her rise to fame, but Serena is inexplicably ignored in the plot despite being arguably the more famous star of the two.

638,70,tennismenace,Absolutely loved every minute,10/10,21 November 2021,"Now I will preface my post by telling you I love to play tennis, so I'm sure that means something. But what means even more to me are the performances of the Williams parents and ESPECIALLY their five girls. We all know Will Smith is a beast and expect greatness from him, and we got it, but for me, what made this movie so great were the facial expressions, body language, and camera presence of the five Williams' sisters....of course, especially Venus and Serena, since they got more face time. Anyhow, that was a very satisfying and entertaining 2:20 for me.... THANK YOU to all who made that gem.Oh, I do have one question I've tried to fact check to no avail...did A. Sanchez Vicario really take a 10 minute plus toilet break? Just curious. Thanks for listening. Cheers.",King Richard
639,71,azeezsmith-61542,King Richard Review: A Emotional Feel Good Sports FILM,9/10,22 November 2021,"King Richard is a feel good sports movie that is easily a crowd pleaser and is the best sports drama film of 2021. Was very interested to see this film, just from loving the trailers and got soo much stuff out of it. Will Smith tops his acting game and unbelievably delivers a charismatic easy going performance of playing the Williams father and sure needs to win an award for best acting ever of his career. Saniyya Sidney suprisingly delivers a powerful sporty performance, and sure enough needs a ton of awards and loved her performance. Along with pleasing performances from Aunjanue Ellis & Jon Bernthal. An emotional captivating biopic story of Venus and Serena Williams facing the tough struggles of acceptance, motivation and determination and the pressure to greatness. Shout out to the music composer- Kris Bowers. Surely to be a crowd pleaser for all audiences and intended audiences going in, definitely a film that's sure to be a strong awards contender- giving this strong praise for sure and finger cross it does. Highly one of the most dramatic streaming sport films I've enjoyed this year. Highly Recommend on HBO Max.",King Richard
640,72,halfxbreed23,Phenomenal,7/10,19 November 2021,"This movie was head and shoulders ine of the best biographies I've seen put to film. It didn't need dates and events superimposed on the screen, it allowed you to watch the growth and patience of future all-stars. Will Smith shines as the father of Venus and Serena but the actors playing the girls did phenomenal as well. Jon Bernthal had so much charisma he exploded off the screen. This movie is definitely worth the 2+ hrs of your life. Inspiring and hard hitting.

644,76,jamuckley,Inspirational Story of Venus and Serena Williams's Upbringing by Richard and Brandi Williams,8/10,4 November 2021,"""King Richard"" is a biopic of Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena Williams, and his plan to turn his youngest daughters into the greatest tennis players of all time.""King Richard"" will be released in theaters and on HBO Max on November 19, 2021, but I was given prescreening passes by Warner Bros to see the film ahead of its release.The film stars Will Smith as Richard Williams, Saniyya Sidney as Venus Williams, Demi Singleton as Serena Williams, and Aunjanue Ellis as Brandi Williams. Other stars in the film include Jon Bernthal, Tony Goldwyn, Dylan McDermott among others. The film was written by Zach Baylin and directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green.Will Smith shined brightest in the film. His portrayal of Richard Williams was excellent. Alongside him, Aunjanue Ellis portraying his wife, Brandi Williams was a perfect counterbalance. She added fierce pushback when Smith played a fearful father, not wanting to see his daughters fail.The most inspirational part of the movie was really the improbable story. That a dedicated father instilled in his daughter a strength and resilience and confidence that they could do anything, become number one in the world, and in Serena's case, become the greatest player who ever lived. Training day and night, rain or shine, he kept pushing them towards greatness, when many people scoffed at his claims about his girls, when many refused to train them, when they saw something insignificant, he saw their full potential.That belief in them, their dedication to training, and ultimately their resiliency in the face of adversity become the perfect trifecta that propelled them to unprecedented success that was never realized by any other player before them. When they went onto the court, they truly believed that no one could beat them. Then they went out and proved it. Not only were they out there proving to themselves, but also to every person who went to see them. They then became role models for every other African American girl (and boy) who wanted to follow in their footsteps.It is possible.We can do this too.As a father myself of two girls, and a boy, the film struck a chord in me about fatherhood, about empowering my kids to succeed, about instilling in them confidence in themselves and in what they are capable of. It was a powerful film that really tugs on your heartstrings at the right time. You see the long odds they faced. You see the backbone not to back down. You see the timely truths spoken when one parent falters to encourage the other.I really appreciated this film. The inspirational true story it is based on was amazing. The positive messages for young people and parents alike are so important.",King Richard

This film is good sometimes bordering on great but the pacing ruins it
This movie was great one of the best acting casts of the year but the pacing ruins it all
Way too long!! So many unnecessary scenes
Predictable but uplifting and emotional in other words your average sports movie I really wanted to rate this a 7.5 but IMDb has no option
See it I believe it's important for kids and to see when and how to be independent.

649,81,jondallaslawyer,Inspiring,7/10,21 November 2021,"A very compelling, true sports movie. The performances were all good (with one exception, discussed below), but in particular the actress who played the mother, Aunjanue Ellis, was outstanding. I thought the best part of the film was her speaking to the father character about her love for their girls. The young actress who played Venus, Saniyya Sidney, also gave a first-rate performance.On the negative side, Will Smith's performance as the father left me unconvinced, as he usually dies.

651,83,agreatstory,"Okay, I am biased in this review",9/10,21 November 2021,"I met Richard Williams about five years ago outside of the Delray Beach Open Tennis Tournament. He was walking towards me but I did not immediately recognize him as the father of my favorite tennis player, Venus, and the GOAT, Serena. But there was something deeply familiar about him; it was as if I was reuniting with some very dear old friend. We wordlessly grabbed onto each other's hands and just enjoyed the moment of what I would call ""communion"". Then I asked ""Are the girls here?"" ""No."" I then gave him some information about a program that would help their tennis, but more importantly, their lives. Will Smith's portrayal of Richard was eerily spot on!The tennis action in the film was also amazingly convincing! How did they do that? CGI? The performances are all top-rate. But, as you can see, I am very emotionally attached to the subject, so you might not have a similar love for this movie. But you might!

654,86,supergye,Excellent biopic of super talent,10/10,22 November 2021,"The major critics of this movie place too much weight on the direction of movie and on-screen time taken by the father. What they don't realize is that any sports biopic has to pick and choose what story to tell, and also have a focused narrative that provides emotional intensity. Not a scatterbrained approach which is seen in documentaries because they try to tell ""everything"". The movie left out much, but that was on purpose.I firmly believe having the father as the centerpiece was the right move. Charismatic, and goal oriented he made Venus and later Serena not only reach their full potential but allowed them to always love the sport. Knowing their father loved them as people and only wanted to them to build their character through a great education and ability to live their childhood as normal kids. He taught the kids how to respect others despite a negative, sometimes racist environment. The burnout can be high for some sports phenoms when they don't do the sport for anyone but themselves and love of it. You never hear of these women being in trouble, and you can watch this movie to find out why.",King Richard
655,87,tmoser1434,Will Smith is back!,8/10,23 November 2021,"Nothing about King Richard will reinvent the sports biopic genre but the film represents such a strong family connection, that it's easy to look past it's clichés.

657,89,Michael_Arm,The Blind Ego Of a Loving Father,6/10,24 November 2021,"This movie isn't a Remember The Titans rise to glory story or even a real story about the Williams sisters as much as it's about (as the title of the movie suggests) their father Richard Williams and his unwavering devotion to sticking to the plan and his love and trust that he had for his daughters and family. Struggling while raising a family in the city of Compton not many choices were available for kids growing up it was either gangs, jails, or drugs. These were paths Richard Williams was dedicated to not let his children follow even if it meant being strict and abnormally hard on his kids.Recognizing that Tennis could be a way out he developed a plan to success even before Venus and Serena were born this plan would be the blueprint to him and his wife producing the 2 greatest tennis athletes this world has ever known.This movie follows his parenting and training from the rough courts of Compton to the plush clay of Palm Beach, Fl where his daughters were trained HIS way by some of tennis greatest coach's. It was either play ball with Richard or you can't play tennis with his daughters.Although the movie ends at the beginning of their careers it has enough substance to tell the story of what made them to be the great players they are now.I consider this a family movie as it very much focuses on the importance of family and is filled with a parents desire for nothing but the best for their kids no matter the sacrifice.Even though the movie is more about Richard it has enough Serena and Venus moments for fans to enjoy and watch their growth as athletes.Will Smith plays a memorable role and transforms into Richard Williams from the start of the movie. The 2 young actresses playing Venus and Serena not only resemble them they also don't let Will Smith steal the scenes.Worth Watching!",King Richard

659,91,ChRiS-803,Will Smith is just playing Will Smith,4/10,21 November 2021,"If Will Smith goes onto winning an Oscar for this film then the Academy is warped. The biggest mistake this film makes is fatal - focusing on Richard who is an enormously unlikable character to root for... especially for 2 ½ hours. If the film focused on the Venus sisters then you have a good story here and whenever it quickly deviates and gives us their POV it's interesting. Instead we have the brass, arrogant, bully Richard screaming his way through a very long and muddled film. He is a mean character. Not worthy for a film. I am unsure what is the appeal here. There's nothing remotely nice about him. Will Smith's performance is Will Smith playing Will Smith yet again. He wants the Oscar bad and has been making attempts for quite sometime now to no avail. But like ""Concussion"" or ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" or ""Collateral Beauty"" - he is copying the same performance. Over and Over again. This time the Academy may feel compelled to give in and finally shut him up. Jon Bernthal and Aunjanue Ellis in supporting roles are good. The girls playing the Venus sisters are also quite good. Smith though just yells and screams and complains and screams again... and that's apparently an Oscar performance.Tech specs are good but the film is enormously long and loses a lot of momentum and the screenplay is a bit too hokey. Also - don't think we need to portray every white person as adversaries. They are not all evil in this world. Could have been something great.",King Richard
660,92,clarks58,Feel good,8/10,15 November 2021,"The movie is a feel good look at what determination and pushing for your goals will achieve. It may not show the darker sides of their father but both girls seem to good well rounded adults thats shows what it takes.Ignore the reviews based on race and that it's an inspiration for black children. That's part of the problem today,focusing on genetics and pigmentation.These girls are an inspiration to all children of every race,and shows what hard work and discipline will bring.

662,94,shama_musani,A little more would have been nice,6/10,25 November 2021,"It was so nice to see Will Smith on screen again. Every actor in the movie did a wonderful job. Being a tennis fan and a huge fan of the Williams sisters it was great to see their story, and how their incredible tennis career was started, however by the end of the movie I was left wanting more. I thought the movie would go more into Serena's beginnings as well, and even more so into both their careers after juniors. Overall, it was a good one time watch.

A stubborn dad with unusual methods to make his daughters big time tennis superstars growing up in Compton. One of his daughters have a better life he pushes them into a career of being in a very white dominated sport and they go on to be the best tennis players in the world. The problem with his methods is that he is way too over-the-top all these deals that they get all this money and they throw all that stuff away it's insanity to me like I don't get it it's like if I got $3 million of endorsements and charities and a nice house and a RV and all these things to compete and get where I was I would just do that I wouldn't do everything else so his methods are just crazy and it's aggravating to watch however I am glad that one guy got killed the one who was beating them up in the movie my God he deserved to die lol but yeah this movie is highly overrated and it's somewhat boring tennis is the only sport where they say love for it to be zero like could you imagine if you looked at your bank account balance and it said love and the scoring system makes absolutely no sense 10 2040 deuce like what the hell does that even mean ?,King Richard
665,0,SnoopyStyle,a bit of fun and some chaos,7/10,26 November 2021,"Venom is getting tired of chicken and chocolate. He wants human brains but Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) resists. Both are eager to get back together with Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) but she's marrying Dan. Serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) invites Eddie to a visit before his execution. Venom attack Cletus who takes a bite transforming him into Carnage.This is the second Venom movie with Tom Hardy. I like Venom and Tom Hardy's chemistry. Michelle Williams needs to bring down her guard. It's her character work because when she actually relax, they have lots of fun. At her best, she's like Mrs. Chen and that's good. The main drawback is the chaotic visuals and the limitations of the villains. Frances is one-dimensional when she could be more. As for the chaos, it's the comic book material and I don't know if anything can be done about that.

666,1,Prismark10,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,5/10,25 November 2021,If the original Venom movie was a mess that sat uneasily in the Spiderman multiverse.Star Tom Hardy has taken more creative control by developing the story for the sequel.Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is still having issues with his alien symbiote Venom. They both constantly bicker as Venom feels restrained as he is not allowed to feed on human brains.Brock gets a chance to interview serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) that could kick start his journalist career.However Brock manages to infect Cletus who develops the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison. Cletus is reunited with his long lost love Shriek (Naomie Harris) and they go on a rampage.Brock needs Venom to provide him with superhuman strength.The sequel is slightly better than Venom. More to do with its short running time.There is very little depth here. Harrelson and Harris are one note villains. Someone could at least given Harrelson a better wig.Despite having three times Oscar winner Robert Richardson as director of photography. A lot of the action is in the dark and is just too frenetic.Brock's and Venom's bickering gets irritating very quickly. A lot of the side characters are poorly served.Do wait for the mid credit scenes before slinging home.,Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Cletus also has a love interest in Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) aka ""the shriek: because of her high pitch deadly voice. On Brock's final visit to Cletus, he infects the serial killer with a piece of Venom which turn him into Carnage who goes on a rampage of revenge.I didn't like this as much as the first film. The climax fight scene had multiple sides and lasted an inane amount of time with equally inane action. I guess this is what audiences' want. I liked seeing Woody not acting old. I thought someone like Octavia Spencer would have made an interesting Francis Barrison.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity unless you notice that Venom doesn't wear pants.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
668,3,kosmasp,PG Carnage that is,6/10,26 October 2021,"If you had issues with the first one and the (low) level of violence it had (PG13 and all that), do not expect this to be any better. This also is PG13. Since I am not too aware of Venom as he was depicted in the comics, I was free of that and quite enjoyed the first one.And while the bonus scene in the end credits of the first Venom movie hinted at Woody Harrelson being the main bad guy in this one (with a now different look for no reason I can think of), he is quite underused to be honest. The main focus of the movie relies on the relationship of Venom and Tom Hardys character. The side story is the love story between Harrelsons character and a woman with an ability ... that should open quite a few doors emotionally and otherwise, but never gets fully explored ... because people have to fight and CGI and all that.So the human drama only works between Hardy and Venom - everything else (even the cop) are side notes at best. Having said all that, the movie works if you don't mind those things too much and cut it some slack. It still feels like a step back from the previous entry.That is until the ending. And I don't mean the end fight (although the CG is quite stunning all things considered) ... I am talking about the bonus scene in the credits. I am not going to tell you what happens and I really hope you can watch it without knowing. As with the looking into the future that the first Venom had in store for us ... this does too! But with quite the promise ... although depending on how you feel about ... certain things you may feel different than me. Still it has to be seen to be believed! Oh the hype is real - and that bonus scene almost made me give this a bigger/higher rating too ...",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
669,4,jboothmillard,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,5/10,28 October 2021,"The first film was an okay anti-superhero spin-off movie from Marvel for the famous enemy of Spider-Man, I didn't expect very much from the follow-up, but I was up for going to see it anyway, directed by Andy Serkis. Basically, in the opening flashback, in 1996, young Cletus Kasady (Jack Bandeira) is helplessly separated from his love, Frances Barrison (Olumide Olorunfemi), who has the ability of sound manipulation, when she is taken away from St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children to the Ravencroft Institute. On the way, Barrison uses her sonic scream powers to escape and attacks young police officer Patrick Mulligan (Sean Delaney). The officer shoots Barrison in the eye and her scream causes an injury to his ear, he assumes she is dead, but is taken to a facility with sound-proof walls. In the present, Detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) contacts investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) to speak to serial killer Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who refuses to talk to anyone other than Brock following their interview a year ago. Brock, still living with alien symbiote Venom, has his career boosted by Venom figuring out where Kasady's murder victims bodies' are hidden. Brock later meets his ex-fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) who tells him that she is now engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott), much to Venom's displeasure. Kasady was previously found guilty of his crimes and sentenced to death by lethal injection; he invites Brock over to San Quentin State Prison to attend his execution. Meeting on death row, Kasady provokes Venom, with numerous insults directed at Brock. Kasady bites Brock's hand, ingesting a small part of the symbiote. Back home, Venom and Brock argue as the alien wants more freedom and to eat bad people, and their fight ends with the symbiote detaching from his body. During Kasady's execution, the red symbiote emerges and blocks the injection, and infecting the criminal's body goes on a violent rampage through the prison, freeing inmates and killing guards. The red symbiote, calling itself Carnage, makes a deal with Kasady, to help him break out Barrison aka Shriek (Naomie Harris) from Ravencroft, and Kasady will help him eliminate Brock and Venom. Mulligan calls Brock and warns him about the situation. In Ravencroft, Kasady frees Barrison, they embrace and travel to their old children's home to burn it down. Mulligan, suspicious of Brock due to his interactions with Kasady before his escape, takes Brock to the police station. Brock refuses to answer Mulligan's questions and contacts Weying as his lawyer. Brock reveals that Venom has separated from him and needs him back to fight Carnage together. Venom has made his way to San Francisco, hopping from body to body, and is embracing his freedom. Eventually Weying finds him and bonds with him, after convincing him to forgive Brock, as the head to break Brock out of the police station. Brock and Venom make amends and reform. Kasady takes Mulligan hostage, and Barrison, failing to find Brock, kidnaps Weying. Lewis was given a message from Barrison about their whereabouts, to give to Brock, as they plan to get married at a cathedral. There, Venom appears and fights Carnage, holding his own against his spawn, who has strong disagreements with Kasady. Barrison seemingly kills Mulligan by hanging, and Venom is eventually overpowered brutally by Carnage, who decides to kill Weying at the top of the cathedral. But Venom regains his strength and saves Weying and provokes Barrison to use her powers, as her sonic blast causes both symbiotes to separate from their hosts. This causes the cathedral to collapse and Barrison falls to the ground and is killed by a falling bell. Venom saves Brock by bonding with him before the impact. Carnage tries to bond with Kasady again, but Venom devours the symbiote. Kasady says that he only wanted to be Brock's friend, but Venom bites Kasady's head off. While Brock, Venom, Weying, and Lewis escape, Mulligan is still alive, his eyes flash blue. Brock and Venom decide to take a vacation while they think about what will happen next. As Venom tells Brock about other universes, a blinding light transports them from their hotel room to another room, and they watch a news report with J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) revealing the identity of Spider-Man as Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to which Venom takes an interest. Also starring Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Sian Webber as Dr. Pazzo and Reece Shearsmith as Priest. Hardy is likeable as both the ordinary reporter and the amusingly snarly being in his body, Harrelson has fun being the camp villain, Harris is interesting if perhaps underwritten, and Graham doesn't do much. As with the original film, the special effects are brilliant to propel the fast-paced chase, fight and explosive sequences and bring to life unworldly creatures, it has great comedic sparring with no-holds-barred language, it is a warped buddy movie style story that works the slightest bit better than its predecessor, predictable and flimsy at times, but a reasonable superhero fantasy action horror.

670,5,paul_haakonsen,"It was something, alright...",5/10,23 November 2021,"Well, if you enjoyed the 2018 ""Venom"" movie then you will also like the 2021 ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" from director Andy Serkis.Now, I am not by any means a particular fan of the Marvel movies. Sure, I watch them because they are entertaining enough for what they are. But it is not something that is important for me to get to watch, as I have little interest in superheroes and such. But given the production scale and CGI of the Marvel movies, of course I watch them for the entertainment.And ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" was actually a standard run-of-the-mill Marvel movie, with some back and forth in the first two acts, and then a massive CGI showdown third act. I guess the guys at Marvel have one formula that they make movies after.Writers Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy put together a movie that was entertaining enough for what it was, and something that felt like it fitted into the Marvel scope of movies. So on that account then ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" was doing well enough. However, if you look at the storyline objectively here, then it was a bit flaccid and lacking in-depth contents. It was essentially just flashy CGI and symbiote fights. And some attempt at sob stories with Brock and Anne.In terms of characters then ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" felt somewhat lacking. The characters felt one-sided and one-dimensional, with the writers not doing much to let the audience submerge end delve into richly detailed character stories and archs.Speaking of characters, then the Venom symbiote was the star of the movie, no doubt about it. And it was certainly fun to watch Carnage on the screen. I am not familiar with Carnage as I never read the comic books, but of course I know of the character as I am no strange to the world of comic books. The human characters in the movie felt like they were mostly just fillers. Personally, of the human characters in ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"", then I found Mrs. Chen (played by Peggy Lu) and Frances Barrison (played by Naomie Harris) to be the most interesting in this movie.I found ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" to be as the 2018 movie, watchable for the CGI and the action, but mediocre on the contents in terms of script and storyline. It is hardly a movie that I will be sitting down to watch a second time.My rating of ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
671,6,CinemaSerf,A (very) distant cousin of the first one...,6/10,17 October 2021,"I was really looking forward to this. I enjoyed the first one and the trails for this sequel looked fun... What happened? It is all over the place. It starts off promisingly enough with an enjoyable set piece with ""Eddie"" (Tom Hardy) and Michelle Williams (""Anne"") - aided by some pithy one-liners from an unseen ""Venom"" but after we are introduced to ""Cletus"" (Woody Harrelson) the thing really hits the skids. The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart ""Frances"" (Naomie Harris) alias ""the Scream"" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper ""Mulligan"" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic ""Venom"" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
672,7,zardoz-13,The Sequel Surpasses The Original!,10/10,7 October 2021,"Sequels can be scary. First, they must live up to the original. Second, they must be as entertaining as the original. Third, they must develop the original characters and storyline without copycatting the original. Fourth, they should surpass the original. Most franchises crash and burn here. Comparably, Marvel's superhero sequel sagas have lived up to this credo. Notable exceptions are the ""Hulk"" sequels and the ""Fantastic Four"" sequels. Happily, ""Breathe"" director Andy Serkis' sequel ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" (**** OUT OF ****) surpasses the fabulous Reuben Fleischer original. Clocking in at 95 lean but hyperactive minutes, ""Venom: LTBC"" conjures up more outlandish action and makes you feel like you're trapped in a runaway centrifuge. Happily, not only is Tom Hardy back in the lead as the trouble-prone protagonist Eddie Brock, but also Michele Williams reprises her role as Eddie's ex-girlfriend Anne Weying and Reid Scott returns as Anne's fiancé Dr. Dan Lewis. Anne still cares about Eddie, but she is still attached to Dr. Dan, much to Venom's chagrin. Of course, Peggy Lu shows up again as Mrs. Chen, the storefront shop owner who plies Venom with chocolate. The larger-than-life action transpires once again in San Francisco. Neither Eddie nor Venom are entirely content with each other. The relationship between the disgraced journalist and the sentient alien symbiote in exile is even more contentious. They make quite an industrial strength ""The Odd Couple."" Eddie must constantly restrain the amorphous, liquid-like creature bonded to him that can assume a humanoid shape. Speaking with a deep, gravelly voice, Venom behaves like a berserk space gorilla. An unabashed carnivore at heart, Venom has a voracious appetite that can never assuaged. Living with Venom is like contending with a temper tantrum-prone two-year and Eddie is frustrated with his outbursts. Primarily, Eddie has put Venom on a diet of chicken and chocolate. Predictably, Venom abhors it. The good vampires in the ""Twilight"" trilogy abided by similar rules. Eddie spends a lot of time patching up the damages Venom does to the premises as well as replacing his television.If you remember the first movie, you know the original concluded with Eddie Brock visiting notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers"") at San Quentin Prison. Bad memories plague Cletus about being locked away at St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children. Using creepy looking sketches, Serkis shows Cletus pushing his granny in her wheelchair down the stairs and killing her. No doubt, this scene drew inspiration from ""Kiss of Death"" (1947) a crime thriller about a sadistic gangster shoved an old woman in her wheelchair down a staircase to her death. Afterward, Cletus tossed an electric hair dryer into his mother's bathtub while she was bathing herself. Indeed, he electrocuted her to death. This scene was lifted from a similar scene in the James Bond epic ""Goldfinger"" (1964) when Agent 007 fried a villain in a bathtub with an electric appliance. Poor little Cletus suffers at the hands of the other Ravencroft inmates until he meets his guardian angel of love, Frances Barrison (Naomie Harris of ""Skyfall""), who rescues him from a beating. She shrieks like a banshee, and her sonic powers are not only deafening but also deadly. The authorities sedate her and ship her off to a hardened facility equipped to withstand her sonic mayhem. Meantime, years later, Cletus summons Eddie to visit him. When he leaving, Eddie notices some handwriting on the wall of Cletus' cell, and Venom memorizes every bit of it. Later, Venom and Eddie deduce where Cletus disposed of the bodies of his victims. Eddie's story about Cletus is published, and Cletus finds himself facing lethal injection. Cletus invites Eddie to his execution. During their brief chat, Venom surprises Eddie, bursts out of his body and attacks Cletus in his cell. Hannibal Lector type villain that he is, Cletus bites Eddie in self-defense. The death row inmate tastes blood like he has never savored. Now, Cletus shares his body with a red symbiote. This DNA spin-off of Venom is bonded to him like Venom is to Eddie. When Carnage emerges from Cletus, the shape-shifting symbiote is a dead finger for Venom. Carnage enabled Cletus to escape from death chamber, kill the warden, and spawn mayhem galore. After their escape, Cletus and Carnage rescue Frances from Ravencroft. While all this is happening, Venom and Eddie have separated. Leaving Eddie, Venom bounces between bodies, but he cannot find a host as ideal as Eddie. Anne tracks down Venom. He has bonded with Mrs. Chen and Anne implores him to reunite with Eddie to vanquish Cletus and Carnage.Director Andy Serkis stomps the pedal to the metal in this ramped-up, slam-bang, high-octane escapade. This sequel qualifies as one of the shortest Marvel movies ever! Serkis never lets the action bog down in extraneous subplots and supporting characters. The visual CGI effects in ""Venom"" provided half of the spectacle in the original film. Meantime, Serkis and original ""Venom"" scenarist Kelly Marcel keep the characters jumping through flaming hoops, and this hysteria propels the action like a runaway train. Although it features some supernatural life and death violence, ""Venom: LTBC"" ladens the storyline with tongue-in-cheek humor. Tom Hardy has his hands full throughout the sequel. Eddie Brock takes a lot of flak not only from Cletus and Carnage but also Venom himself. Once, Woody Harrelson sports a haircut that makes him the spitting image of late Playboy magazine mogul Hugh Hefner. Michele Williams, Reid Scott, and Mrs. Chen participate as much as supporting characters can without stealing the show from the primary characters. If you watch ""Venom: Let the Carnage Begin,"" don't leave your seat when the end credits roll. Alas, you'll miss a pretty substantial foretaste of an impending Venom and Spider-man face-off!",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
673,8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,And there was. And he saw that it was... surprisingly watchable,7/10,15 October 2021,"Eddie Brock(Hardy, still delivering on the physical, living up to his namesake(as in ""Laurel and""), and loving playing Venom) wants to rebuild his career, so it doesn't take much to convince him to meet with imprisoned serial killer Cletus Kasady(Harrelson, who ""Knox"" it out the park). Maybe he can help find the remaining missing bodies? Unfortunately, this leads to... Carnage.This is at least as big of a mess as the first one was. It's less ironically fun, because this time it's on purpose. Then again, it is also substantially more enjoyable for that same reason. It's been a long time since I've seen something that had such wild writing. Try to go in knowing as little as possible. You will definitely not guess the places it goes. The comedy is much more successful, with the highlights being Ms Chen(Lu, master of the deadpan. Please give her a spin-off. You don't even have to take her out of her convenience store. Have her just react to bizarre things that happen right in front of her) and Anne(Williams, way more into it this time, which is definitely in part down to the incredible material they give her). It's hard to overstate how hilarious these two are. The action and CG is a lot better. If all you really want out of this is to see these iconic characters in live action, it will deliver on that. If you can roll with how ridiculous it is, as I did, you will be extremely entertained. If you cannot, this is going to exhaust you, and that is the only way that the 88(!) minute running time(if you don't count the end credits, and since those have only one additional scene(which is mindblowing), and it comes soon after they start running, you might as well leave the moment you've seen that one. The cinema staff will be grateful for it) won't fly by, to the point that it'll seem like you just sat down and then the movie ended. In fact, in that case, it will probably feel twice as long as it is, if not more.This features disturbing content, with a lot of implied violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who thinks it will be their kind of thing. 7/10.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
674,9,view_and_review,Fat-Fingered it,3/10,5 October 2021,"I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"". It was such a botched job from the beginning I wonder what was the thought process behind it.The movie begins with a scene from 1996 at an orphanage or some such place. A girl named Frances Barrison was removed from there because her powers had become too dangerous. In short order we find that she has powers similar to Banshee in that her scream is loud enough to cause damage. Her forcible removal from the institution drove her soulmate, Cletus Kasady, mad.We fast-forward to present day and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is single again. Apparently, things didn't work out between him and Anne (Michelle Williams). That part was fine, but what wasn't was the new Chatty Cathy Venom we had to endure. Here is this sinister, brain-eating, alien symbiote that wants to be a comedian ALL THE TIME. It was flat out amazing how much Venom talked, and not in a good way. He doesn't have the voice for comic relief, yet that's what he was attempting to be and he was failing miserably. But Venom's attempts at stand-up paled in comparison to the fat-fingered manner in which they brought about Venom's antagonist Carnage.Present day Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) was a condemned man.And if I could just sidebar for a second: casting sixty-year-old Woody Harrelson as the antagonist in this movie was such a terrible choice. He was supposed to be fifty at the absolute oldest and he looked terrible in the hairpiece and flashy clothing.OK, back to the story. Cletus was such a prolific killer, the governor reversed the moratorium on the death penalty especially for him. Before his execution date, Cletus wanted to get a message to Frances (Naomie Harris) who was serving time in a cell specially made for her and her powers. Cletus promised Eddie a full story if he would print one simple message on the front page of his paper. Eddie agreed because a full story from an infamous serial killer is career-making. When Eddie visited with Cletus Venom was able to gather a few visual clues to help Eddie find all of Cletus's buried victims without a word from Cletus. This propelled Eddie to newspaper stardom and sealed Cletus's fate. In this very elementary way Eddie became Cletus's nemesis.Cletus wanted to see Eddie one last time before his execution to antagonize him for unearthing his secrets. Somehow, through knowledge Cletus divined from thin air, Cletus began ridiculing Eddie on a personal level that would require a fairly intimate knowledge of Eddie's past. This level of ridicule triggered Venom and he attacked Cletus. Cletus then grabbed Eddie's hand and bit him hard enough to draw blood. That blood, now on Cletus's lips, had enough alien matter in it to be the key ingredient for what happened next.When Cletus was pumped full of the lethal injection cocktail it mixed with his small bit of alien essence and created Carnage; an alien symbiote even more powerful than Venom. Carnage then made a grand exit from San Quentin Prison and we now had a CGI battle between two aliens that could not have been more forced.Let me recap: Frances aka Screech separated from Cletus. Cletus becomes a homicidal maniac. Cletus bites Eddie because he's that crazy. Eddie's blood with a small amount of alien matter is now in Cletus. Cletus gets injected with lethal cocktail and becomes Carnage. Venom fights Carnage to the death.This is a story that maybe gets a fifth grader an A, but a high-schooler an F. This is not the sort of shoddy movie-making I expect from Marvel, even if this isn't part of the MCU.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
675,10,neil-476,Violent fun,8/10,18 October 2021,"Eddie Brock is secretly hosting alien symbiote Venom. In practice, this means getting his apartment trashed regularly while trying to persuade his roomie to eat live chickens rather than bite peoples heads off. When he interviews serial killer Cletus Cassidy, a smidgen of symbiote combines with Cassidy to create pyscho-super-alien Carnage. And Cassidy's mutant girlfriend adds complications...I came out of the first Venom movie confused by its combination of violence, brutality, superheroics, and humour. This time I knew what to expect, and found myself laughing out loud quite often - much of the dialogue between Eddie and Venom is very funny, and Mrs Chen is an utter hoot.The film progresses along largely predictable lines, with lots of action and effects, mostly very well done (there are aome moments where it looked as if they ran out of time to complete the effects). There is plenty of scope for continuing the (sub)-franchise, especially given Tom Hardy's wholehearted and enthusiastic involvement (co-producer and story material). In fact, everyone looks to be having a ball.And, of course, the mid-credits scene is a real teaser!",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
676,11,morrison-dylan-fan,Venomous Carnage.,6/10,8 November 2021,"Getting an offer from my phone company for a free Monday movie ticket,I took a look at the listings for the day. In the mood for a snappy viewing, I decided to pick up the second issue of Venom.View on the film:Whilst involved in a number of big budget films over the last 20 years, director Andy Serkis joyfully embraces B-Movie thrills, with Serkis & Shutter Island (2010-also reviewed) cinematographer Robert Richardson unleashing Venom and Carnage in colourful cartoon violence form, of stylish arc shots diving into the red and black Action mash-up set-pieces.Joined by the sweet, playful turns of Michelle Williams, Stephen Graham and The League of Gentlemen's Reece Shearsmith, Tom Hardy gives a hilarious performance as Eddie Brock / Venom, thanks to Hardy playing on his serious image, by hitting every slap-stick set-piece and lovers tiff with a real relish, whilst Woody Harrelson (in a funny naff wig) chews the scenery as the boo-hiss baddie Cletus Kasady / Carnage.Running a lean 97 minutes, the screenplay by Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy places Brock's romance with Weying to the sidelines, to instead unveil Brock's true romantic partner: Venom. Openly stating in the dialogue that he is out of the closet, the writers cross frantic CBM action with sweet, Gay Rom-Com exchanges of Venom wanting to go public with the relationship that he has with Brock, whilst at the same time delivering absolute carnage.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
677,12,siderite,A very bland movie,5/10,27 November 2021,"I've seen both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson act their behinds off and it was great. I've seen humor and dark humor work wonders for DC. I've seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.Instead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn't, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!But the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.Even the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.The more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
678,13,thesar-2,There Will Be Carnage,7/10,3 October 2021,"When we got to the climax and it felt like the movie just breezed by, I immediately added another star to my rating. A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
679,14,FeastMode,fun but disappointing,6/10,1 October 2021,"I had a good time with this movie. It's fun and pretty funny with some entertaining action.It's also very messy with regards to the story, action and dialogue. The action isn't as good as the first. The story brings no value. And there were some stupid moments.I also can't stand that it's not rated R. I could say that about the first, but it did a great job of pushing the limits while also not having too many moments where it was obvious it would have been better with blood. This movie has SOOO many moments where it could have been amazing if they went all out. It felt so censored.I try to always have no expectations going into a movie. And i knew going in that even though i loved the first one, that doesn't make this one bulletproof. But looking back on it, a movie about carnage could have been so much more. It was underwhelming. Also i wish i got more development from cleetus and carnage.One more thing, tom hardy and andy serkis are awesome. But writing and directing are talents that very few have. I think it shows here and i would have preferred veterans at those crucial positions.I'll caveat this review by saying i couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue, especially from venom. We'll see if that changes anything when i watch it with subs. (1 viewing, 9/30/2021)",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
680,15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Not even a turd in the wind; it's just nothing.,3/10,24 November 2021,"At least 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)' is brief. That's pretty much the only praise I can send its way. I mean, it's genuinely terrible. Frankly, it's almost unfathomable how a team as talented as this can turn out something so amateurish. It honestly feels unfinished. Having said that, it's actually difficult to properly review, because it's just... well, nothing. It's not even boring. It's totally empty, a meal comprised of zero calories. It's also insanely forgettable. If you asked me to recount its plot beat for beat, even while the credits are still rolling, I'd seriously struggle to come up with a coherent answer. As I said, it's difficult to properly review. Perhaps that's because reflecting on it is like trying to remember a bad dream; by the time you try to articulate it, it has already slipped from your mind. Perhaps it's because it leaves you feeling totally apathetic, unequipped to even think about its events, never mind its shortcomings. Perhaps it's because the flick is genuinely less boring than many movies deserving of a similar, or even marginally better, rating, but also genuinely worse than most of those same movies. A bad movie is better than a boring one, I suppose, but a movie that leaves you feeling nothing, not even annoyance, is surely the bottom of the barrel. It goes in one ear and straight out of the other. It's awful, but I can't bring myself to get worked up about it. I'm aware that I haven't even begun to delve into its cavalcade of issues, but I just can't bring myself to do so. That in itself says a lot. I'm totally ambivalent about the piece. It isn't fun, but it isn't boring; it isn't competent, but it isn't offensive; it isn't anything, but it isn't... well, anything. In the end, it will leave you feeling like Venom himself: hungry for something with a brain. Heck, even a bar of chocolate would be more fulfilling. 3/10.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
681,16,ericstevenson,There will be blood?,8/10,9 October 2021,"I wasn't expecting that much right before the movie came out. I actually really enjoyed it! This movie features Eddie Brock interviewing Cletus Kassidy and getting him executed. Cletus bites him and gets some substance from Venom's symbiote body and while about to be executed turns into the villain Carnage. I say that Carnage might be my favorite Spider-Man villain if only because he's the most evil. He actually does manage to get some sympathetic traits as he cares about his girlfriend as her powers aren't compatible with Carnage's.That's really an interesting idea for supervillain couples. Carnage doesn't appear until a half hour in and for a superhero (or mostly supervillain) movie, that's kind of short, but I still felt it got in what it needed to be. I admit it was weird seeing how goofy Venom and Eddie were interacting. They still worked, but weren't quite on type. The best part is of course, the scene at the very end.Venom's been teleported to the MCU. ***",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
682,17,cricketbat,This sequel is a loud and frantic mess,4/10,1 October 2021,"Much like the protagonist in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, I feel like there were two different screenwriters battling about what this movie should be, and they didn't really communicate with each other. This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times. If you liked the first Venom movie, you'll probably like this one. I didn't, so I don't.

I like the Carnage as character, but I wish it was a tougher and gore movie. The relationship between Edin and Venom were like romantic comedy relationship. I don't like rap and I didn't like the main music of the movie. The after credits scene of the movie was shocking, I didn't expect it at all. Anyway, enjoy the movie, it's not a serious movie, but after the after credits scene, it made me very curious.

The action and humor are excellent delights throughout. Andy Serkis direction flowed perfectly with large budgeted carnage. Length is just right too has the right scenes needed nothing boring at all or otherwise. I'm impressed Tom Hardy voiced Venom, plays Eddie Brock, has a writing credit, and is a producer that's wild! Hope my thoughts are appreciated either way highly recommend this fun time experience.

685,20,Thanos_Alfie,Entertaining but...,7/10,23 October 2021,"""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the sequel of ""Venom"", in which we watch Eddie Brock going to interview a serial killer and later finding out that he is a host of another symbiote that helps him escape prison and the upcoming execution.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what to expect from the second. I enjoyed it because it had a simple but interesting plot, plenty of action scenes that were combined very well with comedy and in general it was entertaining. Its short duration helped it to become interesting and not boring but if it would be rated with R it would be even better. The direction which was made by Andy Serkis was good and he followed the same pattern as in the first movie of ""Venom"" and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of Tom Hardy who played as Eddie Brock / Venom, Woody Harrelson who played as Cletus Kasady / Carnage and Naomie Harris who played as Frances Barrison / Shriek were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is not a bad movie but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by it.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
686,21,cruise01,Venom is awesome as always with Carnage which is double the mayhem.,10/10,1 October 2021,5 out of 5 stars.Let There be Carnage is a great superhero film which is better than the first. The story follows Cletus/Carnage (Woody Harrelson) who escapes prison along with Shrieker (Naomi Harris) and causing mayhem. Venom/ Eddie (Tom Hardy) having to stop them before they go after him.The story is what you expect for this film. Continuing with Eddie and Venom being that bickering buddy couple. Sharing the same body. Sharing there perspectives and arguing during the situations. Even at one point they have a fight of trying to attack each other. When chaos is happening with Carnage. Who is menacing. They have to work together to stop it.The action is awesome. Carnage escape in prison is insane. The climatic fight between Carnage and Venom is a non stop thrill ride. The visual effects are amazing. The cast ensemble is perfect. Tom Hardy great as always. Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris are fantastic. With a shorter run time. The film does waste no time with a fast paced direction.There is a mid credit scene that everyone will have a reaction too for a hint where Venom can go next.,Venom: Let There Be Carnage
687,22,eddie_baggins,More of the same with Tom Hardy's turn crying out for a better film,5/10,25 November 2021,"I don't believe you will find too many people out there proclaiming the cinematic virtues of the first Venom film from 2018 but if you found the first Tom Hardy starring comic book adaptation a guilty pleasure watch then I'm sure the antics of this surprising box office hit will hit just the right spots with it offering up material very much the same as the first run around as Hardy's hyperactive and jittering Eddie Brock and his symbiote companion Venom bicker and face dangerous new threat Cletus Kasady and his symbiote Carnage.With actor/director Andy Serkis taking the reigns behind the scenes from the films first director Ruben Fleischer, there was a chance for Let There Be Carnage to do things a little differently this time around but Serkis and his main man (who also gets credit as one of the films story creators) are content from the get go to ensure their effort plays out much in the same way as before, with the tale of Brock/Venom going head to head with Kasady/Carnage feeling like a rinse and repeat of Fleischer's mid-tier affair that was watchable, if anything but memorable.Once more a highlight of proceedings here, in a film that appears to have been edited and trimmed to within an inch of its life in a story that never once pauses for any type of breath, particularly as it races towards a bizarrely out of the blue finale, is the performance of Hardy and the interactions he has with his alien friend.Almost like some bizarre bromantic comedy hybrid, witnessing Hardy bicker amongst himself and his often painful friend is an odd joy to behold and when the film lets its main attraction steal the spotlight, Let There Be Carnage showcases just what Marvel could have on its hands should it allow its wild character time to properly go about his business and while its fun also to see Woody Harrelson chew up some scenery as Kasady and play off Hardy, their enthusiasm isn't enough to cover up the films many other various weaknesses.With its rushed story, CGI infested action scenes that are edited like Michael Bay broke into the editing suite after consuming a slab of Red Bull and a sense that all characters bar Brock are half explored at best, Let There Be Carnage harbors all the disappointing elements of the first film, making one walk away from this ride satisfied in the most basic of ways but wishing that Hardy and his wild-eyed turn could get a Venom film he and the character really deserves.Final Say -Put simply if you liked the first Venom, Let There Be Carnage is sure to satisfy your symbiote needs once more but after two outings that have failed to properly hit the mark, the adventures of Eddie Brock and company are running out of chances to make things work in a sustainable way.2 1/2 man of the cloth out of 5.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

This had too much CGI and carnage, and not enough story to balance it. The entire 'bite' thing seemed like lazy writing and I'm sure a little more creativity would've gone a long way. Still a decent one-time watch. Hardy nails it as always. It's a 7/10 from me.

690,25,southdavid,In my Carnage Truck... Truck Truck Truck.,5/10,20 October 2021,"I didn't really like the first ""Venom"" film that much. I found the banter between Brock and his symbiote to be more wearing than entertaining and the conclusion a CGI constructed mess. I liked this sequel a little more, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that I thought it was good.Whilst interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), some of Eddie Brock's (Tom Hardy) symbiotic blood is introduced to Kasady's system. This goes on to generate Carnage, a powerful red symbiote charged with the psychosis of its host. Escaping from prison, Carnage tries to rescue Kasady's long term girlfriend Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and then find a way to get their revenge on Brock. However, Brock and Venom are not finding life together particularly copacetic.I really wanted to get there this time, to like this one. I like Andy Serkis, I like how committed to playing the character Tom Hardy is, acting as a producer this time and getting his friend Kelly Marcel to return to write the film with him. I liked the cameo roles for British actors, Rosie Marcel, Scroobius Pip and most high profile, Reece Shearsmith, in a role that was a real surprise, as I don't think he's talked about it anywhere.But I just didn't manage it. The bickering between Brock and Venom is rarely (but not never) funny, and again becomes tiresome quite a lot of the time. There's a lot or praise for the tight runtime, but I felt that came at the expense of the story, which is really basic and leads to the under utilisation of several characters - most notably Naomie Harris' Shriek villain, who appears retrofitted into the story to make the conclusion work. I understand the change in Carnage's origins, in order to differentiate the film from the first one, but I didn't like it. The CGI work isn't particularly amazing and the final fight has been done before.The post credits scene was intriguing, but for me, I'm as excited that the character can get into the hands of better storytellers, as for the actual reveal of it.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
691,26,kevin_robbins,This is a worthwhile sequel,8/10,10 October 2021,"Venom: Let there be Carnage (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw last week in theatres. The movie focuses on serial killer Cletus Cassidy and his rough upbringing. When Eddie Brock is chosen to be his reporter, and Cassidy takes a bite of him, the symbiote suit on Brock breaks off and infects Cassidy creating a ruthless killer like never seen before. Can Brock and Venom stay on the same page long enough to bring him down? This movie is directed by Andy Serkis (Heavenly Sword) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killer), Naomi Harris (28 Days Later), Michelle Williams (Blue Valentine) and Stephen Graham (Snatch). The storyline for this is very compelling and is well written from a plot to character standpoint. The dialogue is first rate and hilarious as are the special effects, which are fantastic. The CGI fits the comics to perfection. The action scenes from beginning to end are wondeful; my one complaint, this is the darkest and most violent and gruesome Marvel comic series, and every kill and gore sequence is hidden by random things like cut away scenes or random tornados 🌪 to hide what are gruesome kills in the comic. The dialogue makes up for it but the lack of showing the kills keeps this from being the masterpiece it had the potential to be.

Woody plays a serial killer named Cletus Kasady that becomes the host to Venom's off shoot, Carnage, and since Woody is a little on the nuts side, you can imagine how wack_o Carnage can be. Michelle returns as Tom's ex girlfriend that just wants to be friends with Tom-as most girls do-when she decides to marry another guy. Naomie plays Woody's girlfriend that has some attributes herself. There are lots of battles between the two symbiotes that look great. It's directed by Andy Serkis who has some impressive screen credits of his own: He has played villains in the Marvel Universe, Gollum in the lord of the Rings movies and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes movies. Some of the violence is a little gruesome.There is a scene just as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that connects to another franchise.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

695,30,alindsay-al,An Average Sequel,5/10,26 October 2021,"It's been a busy week but I have finally found the time to watch Venom: Let There Be Carnage and now here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Eddie Brock and Venom have to figure out their relationship while going against a serial killer and his own symbiote.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and voices Venom and he does a pretty good job. I just find his performance as Brock entertaining and clearly somebody who is enjoying himself. He doesn't get much character development but I think there is just about enough here to give Hardy props for his role in the film. Venom is actually given more development and it is executed pretty well, I actually felt feeling towards the symbiote. He is also pretty funny and for me the dynamic between Venom and Eddie Brock is probably the highlight of the film.Supporting Characters
The first Venom film suffered from not creating interesting supporting characters and it is a shame that this film is the same. Woody Harrelson reprises his role of Cletus Kassidy/Carnage from the post credit scene of the first film and I just never got invested in his character. He just came across as a weirdo and a guy with no character. Harrelson is clearly enjoying himself but the character of Carnage is not given the justification that he deserves here. Naomi Harris plays Shriek and unfortunately, she is even worse. She just has these terrible one liners and her over the top bizarre performance is just too much for me and does nothing for me. The great Stephen Graham plays a police officer and it's not even that he is bad, he is actually alright but his character is dull and there is literally no reason to care and it is a shame that such a talent is wasted here. Michelle Williams is back as Anne from the first film and she is just as boring here, I just don't like the character and I have felt like Williams phones it in and signed a contract that she had to be here as she does very little here.Story
The relationship between Eddie and Venom is represented quite well here and I like how we saw more things from Venom's point of view this time around. But it is flawed, the dynamic between Carnage and Venom fails and the dynamic between Brock and Cassidy doesn't work either. The characters don't get enough time to develop and you won't care about anybody apart from Venom and maybe Eddie.Script
The script is okay, the humour was something I was worried about in the trailer but I can't deny that it worked for me. I chuckled quite a few times with Venom having some funny one liners. But the drama falls really flat and is so rushed that when it comes to the big showdown I kind of didn't care.Style
Both Venom and Carnage both look great and the clash between them is way easier to follow then the action in the first film. But the pacing is all over the place, it starts off at 100 miles an hour and then slows down and ties to focus on way too much. It needed a longer runtime to make the audience care about the characters.Overall
Overall, Venom; Let There Be Carnage is an average film that doesn't rise above its predecessor. It is okay and I don't think will bring any new fans but there is a huge post credit scene and that is all that people will be talking about coming out of this film.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

In an argument with psycho Cletus Kassidy (Woody Harrelson), Kassidy ingests some of Venom's blood which gives him the ability to change into an even more terrifying alien - let battle commence.Really quite sharp and fast film hurtling along with wit and imagination with Hardy great fun as the wussy Brock and fun turns from wide eyed Harrelson and Naomi Harris as Cletus' girlfriend who can scream the house down. Short sharp undemanding fare.

699,34,andrewchristianjr,ENTERTAINING AND SERVICEABLE.,8/10,7 November 2021,"Not as bad as most people say. A vast improvement over the first film in the series. Everything is still entertaining and serviceable. After all, this sequel also features a post-credits scene that we shouldn't miss. Tom Hardy has a truly magnetic presence and Woody Harrelson gleefully chews all the scenery. CGI is an order of magnitude improved and there is a solid flow to the film that works with the somewhat short 90 minute runtime. Pure popcorn and a nice integration into the MCU canon. Worth a look.

700,35,masonfisk,BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE BUT IT'S NOT SAYING MUCH...!,7/10,31 October 2021,"Tom Hardy returns in this current sequel to the 2018 original. Now finding a sort of peaceful co-existence w/the Venom symbiote, Eddie Brock, Hardy, has gotten his life sort of back on track (being an ace reporter again & living w/the fact his ex, again played by Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, has moved on). Into this fractious détente comes a call from a death row inmate, played again by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson (who cameo'd in the last film), to tell his tale (where we've seen in flashback Harrelson's romance w/another disturbed inmate, played by Oscar nominee by Naomi Harris, cut short when she used her power, a banshee type scream to escape during a prison transfer but gets shot by a cop but not before deafening him). W/Harrelson's story published, he believes his & Hardy's life are entwined even inviting him to his last meal where he takes an opportunity to bite Hardy thus infecting him w/Venom & creating Carnage (which prompts an explosive outbreak from prison) whose sole goal is to reunite w/Harris & take revenge on their foes. Definitely better that the first film now directed by ace mo-cap performer Andy Serkis but it still has an air of 'what for?' hovering above it since Venom doesn't exist, at least for me, w/o the presence of Spider-man so the film ends up being an unabashed cash grab w/o a hint of irony or subtlety. Even the well done special effects, particularly the fidelity of the sound, started to rattle me physically where I felt I was being bombarded on a neutron level. Also starring Stephen Graham as the aggrieved detective.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
701,36,aidanratesmovies,"Not as good as the first, but a decent flick nevertheless",7/10,2 October 2021,"First off I just want to say what an amazing end credits scene this film has- like job well done whoever made that scene in particular- you deserve a raise. As for the film itself it can be a mixed bag at times, but I did enjoy it. Woody Harrelson's character takes more of a center focus than Tom Hardy and the titular character- which can be interesting but also a bit frustrating cause the film feels like its missing the point. No matter what you thought pf 2018's Venom, it was clear that Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom was the best part- so why underwhelm the audience with needless drama just to further the plot and come up with something more original? That being said, Harrelson's character is rather fascinating to watch unfold on screen- and they do give him a bit of a heart, which is also great to see as well. There are tons of funny moments throughout the film in its entirety. The soundtrack is nothing special, more of the same from the first film, but the plot is kinda all over the place. It feels like Director Andy Serkis doesn't quite know what to do with the films titular character- especially when it comes to tone. They could have made a lot of the scenes with Venom a whole lot more enjoyable and less harsh to watch. That being said, the film itself is very entertaining, I was never bored with any of it, even despite its flaws. Yeah its messy and yeah it can be predictable, but despite Serkis's bland directing- the film does manage to gain a lot of empathy from the audience and prove to be quite a blast to watch. If you are looking for an extraordinary film, this isn't the one for you, go see Shang-Chi instead, but if you're looking to kick back and relax- and maybe just enjoy yourself- this may be your cup of tea.My Rating: 6.6/10.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Woody Harrelson is a great villain and a huge improvement over the previous one.Andy Serkis' direction is fantastic, much stronger and technically competent, especially with the CG side, resulting in a better filmed and more stylish sequel with a much stronger and intense final battle.It's extremely well paced and wastes no time on filler with effectively funny jokes throughout that hit a lot more than miss.

703,38,rgkarim,"A Carnage Of Mediocre Elements and Action, Offset by A Venom Of Comedy",7/10,1 October 2021,"LIKES:The Animation:
I'll give them props on their design for making the symbiotes come to life, Sony's latest dive into Venom's creation is very good. Tight forms, great fluidity of the black ooze that makes him up, and those sensational teeth are perfect for bringing him to life. The movement is fluid, it goes super well during the movement pieces, and the tendrils acting out the comedy moments are awesome. When Carnage appears, that chaotic redness is not quite a vivid as the comics, but definitely has the blood element and chaos of the malicious symbiote. It's grimy and viscous, and has the sinew of the tendrils that offers a little more of the nightmare that Carnage is known for, including his devilish bladed arms.The Music: I know a soundtrack for a Marvel movie is not the most noticeable feature, but much like the first film it's got attitude, beats, and some layers to it. Some symphony work goes alongside the fanfare sound effects to help make the inspiring pieces we love in super hero movies. It's the rap times though that really work and man are they awesome. Rap beats carry the harder attitude of the Venom world, with that no consequences edge that works to go with Venom's attitude. The end trailer song was my particular favorite and I liked given the sweet tones of the chorus and the verses bringing the hardcore beats.The Acting:
Certainly not the Oscar's level others have hit, but I enjoyed the performances of the cast on this installment of Venom's chronicles. Tom Hardy essentially acting with himself is certainly the highlight, with a natural flow to the chaos of the lines that he seemed to write for himself. Hardy as Eddie has the same nervous, loser attitude he conveyed in the first, that awkward atmosphere he brings doing super well to act as the moral compass to guide the ever aggressive Venom through the world. As Venom, he's hilarious, still acting like a newborn/toddler who can't take no for an answer and wants to eat everything he can for his survival. I loved the lines he delivered as Venom, I loved the joy, horror, and vulnerability he brought, and the commentary is certainly one for the books for voice acting. Harrelson still does his job well as the insane serial killer of Cletus, especially that eerie, unsettling longing that he seems to have with his darker roles. While not the most insane of a serial killer, he works well enough for the direction they took him, and they sort of corrected the hair for me so that's a win. I can't say he was my favorite villain character, so there really is not much I can say outside of a solid delivery for his backstory and that longing of something serial killer roles thrive on. Michelle Williams wins for a fun support, but again she is not utilized the best in this film and could have had more involvement on so many levels for me. The times she was on board, she was funny, a good nonverbal and verbal acting mixing to bring some of the more unique comedy moments I've seen in Marvel in some time.The Comedy:
Hands down the best part of the movie is the comedy and it is funny. Like the last installment, that dynamic relationship between Venom and Eddie is solid, a duo who play so well off of each other despite being the same voice. The aggressive personality bossing around the meeker personality goes super well, and Venom's mannerisms and taunts are a wonderful comedic tool. Then, they start using the internal monologue even better with Venom, showing that combative mindset distracting Eddie from answering normally, especially when Venom pushed enough to cause Eddie to outburst. Finally, when you see Venom get the driver seat a little bit, the writing works well with Venom exploring the universe a little more. His speeches, his jokes, and so much work with this new angle to Venom and again I was cracking up at the vaudeville humor he brought, alongside the commentary of the movie. And as I said, Michelle Williams does well in her roles, sometimes acting as a prop and other times a fantastic medium that blends all the styles together. There are a few things that Harrelson does that are funny, but they are in the backburner for me and lost to Venom's constant banter.The Mid Credits Scene:
Hands down the most exciting part, Venom's extra scene shows great promise for the series in so many ways. It's still got great comedy and chemistry you have been seeing for most of the film, but does not just act as the comedic finish Marvel likes to do. No there is some story behind it and then a nice surprise to set up the future of our dark symbiote. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but Serkis and company get props for this one.Dislikes:
The Plot:
My friend may have liked it, but for others like me, the plot is again a rushed mess that does not utilize the characters well. The focus on the comedy allows for development of Venom and Eddie's relationship, and though not massive improvements or anything revolutionary, it works well for the buddy comedy approach. Yet, where it really went wrong involved everything else in their lives when I was watching this film. Where Anne was a key factor in the first film, became more of a side piece in this, with her plot elements opening up some comedic factor, but little else past this. The whole Eddie moving on with life and trying to adapt to the new stakes, was kind of rushed and lame, even to the point of conflict that happens in this film. The story with Cletus was... okay, and a driving factor for the decisions of how to get to Venom, but I can't say it fit with the story I had envisioned for the psychotic serial killer I know Cletus to be. And for Shriek's inclusion, held promise, but as she was not a symbiote, so she was not too ingrained into the full story. Venom's second installment does not have the same cohesiveness that other Marvel film's do and it's a shame again due to what they could have executed.Carnage feels a bit too controlled:
If I remember several comics and cartoon shows correctly, Carnage was a force that was chaotic, deadly, and insane, hence why he was able to be such a dark and threatening force. In this movie though, I don't think his utilization matched that and in fact made him a little too logical. Certainly there are moments where that primal force of hunger and death seeking are seen, but I can't say I was impressed with the other ways they took the symbiote and his host. There was no impending terror of them hunting, no close calls and horrific sequences that haunt your dreams. As for his other powers, I guess I expected more based on what the trailers showed off, but that did not happen for me. The blades were more design than used and even the projectiles were minimized, which with Carnage minimal is not way they usually go. Carnage is one of those villains whose execution requires a lot of study and detail and the direction I took only somewhat filled that craving.The Action:
Or better yet lack of it. Venom's second film is still heavily comedy based and seems afraid to embrace the action that a dark tale could really execute. Looking at the movie as a whole, there was about fifteen minutes total that we saw of this film and that's sad when comparing to so much of the other Marvel films. Most of the scuffles are one sided displays of CGI slamming that really offers no suspense or horror, so I can't say it was that exciting for me. Then the climactic ending, was kind of bland for me, again given what I've seen in the other Marvel movies. A ten minute bout of a few punches and slams that, while appropriate as a start, did not use the powers that we as fans know these monster have. Where was the dance of crimson blades a crazy, scarlet symbiote could unleash? Where was Venom's strength utilizing the environment to combat those blades and use tricks to offset the strength of Carnage? Where was Carnage's mutations evolving out and further surprising us? The answer is not on the final cut, though I did enjoy the clever use of sound bringing more of the hosts out. The final ordeal is anticlimactic for me, and did not live up to the potential that these two titans are known to bring, and could have used about 15 more minutes at least or at a few other conflicts to break it up.The VERDICT:
Venom 2 was okay with me, but it's not the best comic book based movie to come out of the woodwork. Certainly the visuals and attitude of the movie are there and the acting brings that world to life and does well with the established dynamics. It's biggest strengths for me were again the comedy and the mid credits scene, the former being the biggest selling point for fun for this film. Yet, the movie's plot is still a mess and the handling of Carnage, while not the worst, there was a lot of potential they missed out on in his use. Look wise he's great, but the Carnage I know and the Carnage I got, did not match for what I had hoped to see. In addition, the action was very limited and did not really satisfy the buildup they were trying to make. As such, the movie is okay, and fortunately has enough special effects and music to get a trip to the theater for a see. My scores for this film are:Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
704,39,rannynm,"Amazing CGI Graphics, Especially When Building Fall And Titans Fight",8/10,2 October 2021,"I like Venom: Let There Be Carnage because it is based on one of my favorite Marvel characters, Venom. I like that Carnage is a product of Venom, so watching these monsters clashing with each other is phenomenal.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is about a journalist named Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) who has a dark black, Spiderman looking devil named Venom that lives inside his body. Most of the movie shows Eddie and Venom not getting along, because Eddie is sick and tired of having Venom inside his body and Venom wants to be free to eat people. Venom is very clumsy and destructive and Eddie is frustrated because his apartment is a mess. An assassin named Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) knows Eddie and asks to speak to him before his death sentence is carried out. Eddie visits Cletus in prison, but Cletus antagonizes Eddie with his past and Venom comes out of Eddie's body to choke Cletus. Cletus bites Eddie's hand and tastes Venom's blood. So guess what happens? You have to watch the film to find out.This film has amazing CGI graphics. The graphics look so real and the buildings falling apart when Venom climbs between them look real as well. The fighting scenes between these two titans are so incredible that it makes you want to see more. I expected there to be more encounters between Venom and Carnage and was disappointed that there weren't more. The movie has a good combination of comedy and action. The music is appealing in every scene. My favorite part is, of course, the battle between Venom and Carnage in the church. Carnage is huge compared to Venom and looks more powerful than him because Carnage has multiple extremities which Venom does not have.The moral of this film is to never underestimate yourself no matter your size or strength. You do not know if you can win the war if you don't go to battle.I give Venom: Let There Be Carnage 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

707,42,arungeorge13,"Not nearly as much carnage as I'd have liked, but whatever! [+52%]",5/10,23 November 2021,"Venom 2 is a somewhat enjoyable, super campy outing that almost feels like an extended cut of the first film. The first act doesn't have anything substantial happening, and when we get to the second, there's way too much going on. The pacing is all over the place, only broken by a few interesting scenes, such as the one where Venom attends a rave party. The humor hasn't improved drastically as yet, and the main baddie - Carnage (and his human counterpart Cletus, a serial killer) played by Woody Harrelson) - is almost caricature-like. If you expect Harrelson's Cletus to be one of those fascinating psychopaths, then you're probably in for the wrong movie. Nope, this ain't Natural Born Killers. The writing by Kelly Marcel (who wrote the first film) sticks to familiar narrative beats, tucking in not one but two fun jailbreak scenes.I found Carnage's design to be a bit weak. The differentiations lie in the colors and the tentacles; that's sufficient to make the climactic showdown (set in a church, with the church bell having a pivotal role to play) very vibrant. It also sucks that for a film that has too many lines mentioning chewing people's heads off, we don't get to see either Venom or Carnage pull that off in a satisfyingly gory way (yes, I'm looking at that damn PG-13 rating). There's a mid-credits scene that should send almost everyone into a frenzy, and that portion gets a double thumbs-up. The odd dynamic between Eddie and Venom is surprisingly given more weight in the film, and it's safe to say that the sequel has managed to avoid a reiteration of some of the original's poor one-liners. The bottom line here is that the film doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you!",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Well this time they went with Woody Harrelson who played a deranged serial killer, good but not quite an equal adversary of Venom.What were the problems,The story was thin, very thin, I never ceases to amaze me how studios run with an idea when a classroom of 14 year olds would come up with 20 better suggestions that were more imaginative.Unfortunately there was a lot of style over substance.Venom's adversary needs to be majorly different from him for variety.Stop introducing the same characters, believe me the viewing audience can cope with change.Overall I really liked the movie and it was Tom Hardy that I really liked, the rest was mostly padding in a continuation of the first movie.

Kasady becomes Carnage, during a prison break & following a botched execution attempt. Venom has to stop Carnage's rampage, no matter the cost.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a brilliant film. Director Andy Serkis has masterfully taken over directorial duties from Venom(2018) director, Ruben Fleischer. This movie has doubled down on all the elements that made the 2018 original, entertaining. The one-liners will make you laugh raucously. It has also given us a much better villain who has more depth than Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot from the previous film. The action set pieces are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. I definitely still miss the lack of a connection to Spider-Man. Tom Hardy is spectacular as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy's physical performance is one of the highlights of the movie. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Harrelson has made the long wait for the iconic Spider-Man villain to appear on the big screen, worth it. Michelle Williams is excellent as Anne Weying. Naomie Harris is fantastic as Frances Barrison/Shriek. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Stephen Graham is good as Detective Mulligan.

710,45,bankofmarquis,Suffers from Sequel-itis,5/10,7 October 2021,"If you ever heard of the term ""Sequel-itis"" and wondered what a good example of film suffering from this malady would be, look no further than VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE.The sequel to the surprisingly well made - and well acted - 2018 VENOM that introduced audiences to the (sometimes) villain, (sometimes) anti-hero, VENOM and the human/symbiot that he has bonded to (it makes sense in the first film) - this sequel looks and feels like a quick ""money-grab"" that is keeping this character ""warm"" for bigger things (I hope) down the road.Directed by famed motion capture expert, Andy Serkis, VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE feels like a movie that was directed by a Special FX veteran for this film is long on special effects and short on what makes a film work - plot and character.And that's too bad for the 2018 VENOM film was a surprise in that while it had it's CGI moments (and plenty of them), it also had interesting plot and characters and took full advantage of two of the better actors working today - Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams.The sequel looked promising enough as both Hardy and Williams were back and Woody Harrelson was cast as the main villain (with Naomi Harris along as the villain's sidekick) so some of the ingredients were there for a quality sequel.Unfortunately, this sequel leaned heavily into the CGI-ness of the first film and made the CGI Alien Venom the focal point of the story, relegating the humans to the back. No actor was pushed further to the back than Williams who was stuck with a weak ""damsel in distress"" arc while Harrelson and Harris take turns over-acting the other making their pair of villains some of the weakest in recent comic-book movies memory.And then there is the performance of Hardy as Eddie Brock. He is sleepwalking his way through this film, looking like he has very little interest in what is going on and just wants to grab his paycheck and get home.Some of these sins could be forgiven if the CGI elements - and the battles between Venom and Carnage - are interesting. Unfortunately, they just are not - they are ""fine"", but nothing interesting or original, so this film is destined to get washed off the shore (and memory) as quickly as a sandcastle is washed away on a beach.If you are going to check out this flick, make sure you stay for the ""end credits"" scene (which is only, thankfully, about 2 minutes into the credits), it is the best part of this film.Letter Grade: C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

712,47,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Hilariously funny,8/10,24 November 2021,"I am not a big fan of present day Marvel/Disney comic book films, but this film had me in stitches. The comedy was legend. Venom and Eddie Brock's relationship had me laughing. It was like Eddie Brock was living with a toddler who needed constant praise and attention. Wanting to be the hero and if it couldn't, it would go into a tantrum. But when I heard the F-bomb thrown into the dialog, I knew this couldn't be a Disney/Marvel movie. Sure enough it was a Sony Columbia Pictures film. I don't care what the haters will say, but comic book films are so much better with dark comedy -- at least for adults.If I had to say which few comic book movies I liked, this one would be right next to Deadpool for its funny and dark humor. The film almost didn't need Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris; if only for the only reason Venom needed an antagonist to battle.Just one thing, Anne Weying is the worse lawyer ever. She tells Eddie to tell the cops the whole true and everything. Damn, that's a lawyer you don't want representing you.All of the actors gave good performances, especially Tom Hardy.

They really make Venom a way comedic character than the first one, and sometimes it was too much and it bothered me, and sometimes it works so overall i still enjoy Venom, while Carnage is just an absolute carnage, he was amazingly scary, terrifying, and brutal, he was really the best thing in the movie despite being the villain, Shriek was alright, i didn't hate her but i felt she was just unnecessary, Anne, Dan, and Mrs. Chen have a good performance, the final battle was solid and the post-credit scene was great, overall Venom Let There Be Carnage still not as good as the first one but it still a pretty good movie.

714,49,bob-the-movie-man,Chickens... but turkeys would be more appropriate.,4/10,16 October 2021,"I was not a great fan of the original Venom, although I did find aspects of it to like. Unfortunately, for me, the sequel - ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" - delivered even less. And I found aspects of it positively distasteful.Positives:
While most of the cast seem to be doing sequel-paint-by-numbers, I thought Naomie Harris was superb as the shrieking 'X-woman-style' villain. (I'm embarrassed to say that it took me until the end titles to realise she WAS Naomie Harris!)Some of the comedy lines between Brock and Venom made me chuckle.Negatives:
My main beef was with the script and that came down to two primary issues:-- Firstly, virtually nothing happens. It's not too much of an understatement to say that the whole plot can be summarized as a) a villain is introduced; b) the villain teams with another villain and c) Venom defeats them. It's just all so bland and linear, without any sort of discernible story arc.-- For a movie pitched more at the comedy end of the Marvel spectrum, the script is unpleasantly violent. (And, yes, before Marvel fan-boys attack me with comments, I know that this Sony/Marvel offering is NOT part of the official universe). There are numerous points at which I thought ""Ugh!"" and a nasty taste entered my mouth: the butchering of a 'Family man' prison guard, pleading for his life; the brains of a very polite young grocery store boy being senselessly smashed in; and the massacre of a priest in his own cathedral. (Actually, I have no idea what happened with the priest during the ""power-up"" scene - - a cut by the censors perhaps?) My issue is that, tonally speaking, there is a horrible mismatch between these unnecessarily violent scenes and the lighthearted and flippant nature of the rest. It's like putting a vicious gang-bang rape in the middle of ""Ant Man"".Sorry. I know he has a lot of fans, but I'm not a great fan of Tom Hardy's acting style here. ""Legend"" proved what class he could deliver. But this performance seems to be streets away from that. An acting colleague last week commented that he was looking forward to the interactions between Hardy and Harrelson. But I found both to be underwhelming.I found the visual effects for the emerged Venom to be utterly unconvincing. There were times when it looked like nothing more than a puppet on strings.I'm normally a fan of Marco Beltrami's scores. But I found the music in here to be intrusive and distracting. And that's before some (to my ears) pretty awful rap-based tracks over the closing titles.Summary Thoughts on ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"": You'll already judge from my balance of comments that this one just didn't work for me. Even as a ""park your brain at the door"" action movie, I thought it felt lazy and lacklustre. My advice? Save your money and go and watch ""The Last Duel"" instead.By the way, there is a mid-credit monkey (end-credits scene in onemannsmovies speak), worth staying for, which ties this Marvel offshoot to another sector of the Marvel catalogue. However, note that there is NO post-credits monkey!!! Like a whole bunch of us in the cinema, you'll feel pretty foolish if you sit through the interminable titles just for the film to end and the lights to come up!

715,50,wetmars,Tainted Love.,7/10,2 October 2021,"Where to start on this. Let us start with Cletus Kasady. He is widely known as a sadistic serial killer who killed his grandmother by pushing her off the stairs, threw a hairdryer on his mother's shower, tortured his pet with a drill, and did many horrific things until he was thrown into a place where he belongs. He eventually gets bullied and meets with the love of his life. I enjoyed the presence of Woody Harrelson. Although I do have problems with Carnage, I felt like this film should have been Rated-R, but you know Sony with Marvel are iffy on Rated-R Marvel films, and we rarely get them. I do feel like if this was received as Rated-R, the film would showcase the true horror of Carnage and some brutal extreme bloodbath slaughter. I am genuinely disappointed about the prison escape scene, but it was still cool. It could have been so much more. Besides the negative, the best VFX is all to Carnage and looks brilliantly stunning. The fight scenes are especially stunning and epic. I honestly thought we were never going to see Carnage in live-action. It just seemed unlikely. Frances Barrison as a character. I feel like she needed more exploration, an actual personality rather than mad love. I am a bit disappointed. I find the Carnage stuff with her quite predictable since the symbiotes don't like sound. Perhaps an 8/10 for Cletus Kasady, a better villain than Riot. Great screentime & dialogue from Cletus that makes make him menacing and seriously creepy when it comes to him being so obsessive with Eddie. ""All I've ever wanted in this world is Carnage."" I just wished both were explored more.Now, for the one and only. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom! They are easily the best part of the film. I honestly thought that the film was going to be all comedic, but it thankfully calms down in the Second Act where Venom abandons Eddie, and we focus on Eddie's character. It does somewhat has similarities to Spider-Man 2 in my perspective. I do like the parts where Venom takes care of Eddie, instead of both of them fighting each other. ""Oh ****! Where are you going? THAT IS A RED ONE! You need to come out like right now. I will let you eat EVERYBODY! YOU PROMISE? I promise! OH YEAH!!!"" It's always nice to see their dynamic, and it never fails to entertain me. Anne Weying is always great to see. I feel bad for Dan to experience all of this. Mrs. Chen is also great.The post-credit scene is insane. The world around Eddie/Venom sitting in a hotel room on a beach randomly changes due to Multiverse madness. And we see our beloved J. K. Simmons announcing that Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker. Venom says: ""That guy!"" then licks the screen. Could Eddie/Venom could be in No Way Home? In the trailer, we see Peter wearing a black symbiote suit where he's running in what appears to be, a lunchroom, and in the 2:27 mark, fighting Electro. Unpopular take, but I actually liked Jamie Foxx as Electro, but that will be another story soon. Well, upon a closer look, it appears to be some gold on it. I am mistaken by assuming too quickly. Oh yeah, about No Way Home. I am wary that it will once again meet the ""too many villains"" stuff. It was kinda obvious that Venom was going to encounter Tom Holland's Spider-Man because of the Sony - Marvel Spider-Man complication. Maybe we will see Eddie/Venom in the upcoming second trailer. Man, they weren't kidding that Phase 4 was going to be ""crazy"".Overall, it's a fun, messy, and entertaining film with action. I would like to see if there is an extended Director's cut on this. The animated scene of Cletus' backstory was a little nice touch with narration. The main movie had a stronger & better story. Although there were many subplots like Eddie being questioned about suspicious activities like dead bodies around the hotel where he lives, and his ""episodes"" from the previous film. Venom eventually returns to Eddie and breaks out of the room. The Police investigate the room only to find a hole. In the Third Act, we get some foreshadowing for Venom 3 as the Officer's eyes turn blue. It doesn't make sense with the dialogue where Carnage says: ""Father"" to Venom. Probably a cultural thing on their planet? The final battle was great with a lot of tensions, eventually ending where the bell falls killing Barrison. Venom saving Brock by bonding with him before the impact. Kasady reaches out his hand trying to bond with Carnage, but Venom grabs the symbiote and eats it. Eddie lets Venom decapitate Kasady. Now, I am terribly sorry if this review is all over the place. If you watch the movie, it will make sense that this review is wack.7-8/10.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
716,51,Movi3DO,Trash,4/10,2 October 2021,"THAT guy....Eddy Brock and his best friend continued to save the world. Let's be straight: the first Venom movie was not good, but I still enjoyed it because of the humor. However, this movie managed to take away a lot of that comedy and created a plot that was even worse than the first one. There were so many plot conveniences that rushed the movie forward. Our main villain is just another crazy dude, nothing more than that.Of course they kept the PG-13 rating. Man Venom would be SO fun if there's gore. It pissed me off that these production companies wanted some good bucks instead of making a competent movie. The camera editing were just all over the place. I can barely comprehend what was going on. This made the action scenes messy with no fun.Even worse, the relationship between Eddy and Venom evolved in such a cringe way. Not all the humors landed, which was disappointing. Their relationship carried the first movie, but this time there's just no way.Obviously the post credit scene, which was surprising to many. However, considering how much of a joke Venom is, I'm not so optimistic about this decision.Overall, just a messy disappointment. You can basically watch the post credit scene on YouTube or something and skip this movie. 3.5/10.Go watch Titane instead, that's an actual good movie.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
717,52,kjproulx,"Very Silly, but Fun",6/10,1 October 2021,"Let's start by jumping back to 2018. When Venom was about to be released, I had zero interest, and being a Spider-Man fan myself, that shocked me. I just didn't think a villain story that only exists because of Spider-Man could've worked on its own. To my surprise, while Venom wasn't a great movie by any means, I ended up having some fun with it. For that, I was certain they could improve on it with a sequel and Venom: Let There Be Carnage does just that. It's still not that good, but the novelties are cranked up to eleven and I had a blast with those elements of this film.Picking up after the first film, Cletus Kasady's (Woody Harrelson) history with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is about to come to a head. With Kasady on death row and about to be executed, he stumbles upon a way to escape, which eventually turns him into the even more villainous Carnage. Hellbent on nothing but destruction, Carnage poses a real threat for Venom/Eddie. Other than a couple of surprises along the way, that's pretty much it for the premise. The movie wanted to pit Venom and Carnage against each other and it doesn't do anything except that. The fight and the journey to that fight is what made the movie worthwhile for me though.Tom Hardy is one of the most gifted actors out there and his quirky performance with Venom (himself) is what sells these movies. If it wasn't for his commitment to this role, these movies would be absolutely terrible. On top of that, Woody Harrelson clearly knows the type of film he's in because every moment he's on-screen is a joy to witness. He doesn't have the same relationship that Venom has with Eddie, but that's also what made it more entertaining. His character is a murderess, evil convict, but Carnage is even worse. This makes for a climax that feels earned, even though the cast is just having fun most of the time.The weakest portion of the first film for me was the fact that I didn't care about the relationship between Eddie and Anne (Michelle Williams). Her character was barely in the film, but you were meant to feel the loss Eddie had after breaking up with her. This time around, she's given a little more to do, but she also feels like she's more aware of the type of movie she's in. Even though the first movie was a little self-aware, they've now fully leaned into that. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is nothing but silliness, but it's very entertaining silliness.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage probably won't win anyone over who didn't like the first, but I'll still say it's a better movie as a whole. It's a very breezy 97 minutes and it doesn't waste any time with side plots. There are quite a few weird and bizarre scenes, but it works if you're aware they're doing it on purpose. Andy Serkis as the director here took the things that worked about the first film and just did more of that, leaving the excess in the past. If you're just looking for a simple, fun time at the movies, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is purely that. There is also a major post-credits scene that says a lot about the future of Marvel. I will give this one a mild recommendation.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

I am not a fan of superhero or antihero movies, nor of Marvel or DC (although I prefer the latter for its more crude style), it should also be noted that ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" being from Marvel, it has a crude style in its plot as the first part also had it, leaving aside the typical optimistic message of other films of the aforementioned Marvel. The script is entertaining, packed with action, suspense and comedic moments, the cinematography is well done, the performances are good, the cinematographic direction is effective, and the special effects are explosive. A great movie without becoming a masterpiece.

For serious, A film that stars two mighty lethal and ferocious beasts like Venom & Carnage; not having an R-rating should be deemed as an act of foolishness, period.I know the approach in the first part was pretty similar, however in that case, I could say it was still moderately reasonable. Simply cause that film was cited more like an Origin Story than anything else and it also was in search of a strong base of audience. There, PG-13 makes a lot of sense! But now when they've got what they wanted, this time with the sequel, specifically with Carnage in there, it should have been bestowed with nothing but Gore & Violence.Without those vital characteristics, Venom 2 rather feels like unfinished work. Seems like the makers didn't even care to bring it to its fullest potential! The story is half-baked, the editing is anything but crispy, even the CGI; which was supposed to play a comparatively greater role, looked nasty in places.As for the characters; well, what can I say? It's just that, besides Venom & Eddie; others had little to no significance. Sadly, this involves Carnage as well, shocking right? I know! Given the buzz and all the anticipations surrounding this exotic symbiote; I'm sorry to say his portrayal didn't live up to the hype.The sole highlight and probably the only saving grace here is the Humour and of course this odd yet promising Dynamic in-between Venom & Eddie.

723,58,MrDHWong,A notable improvement over the original despite not being a difficult task,7/10,25 November 2021,"""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is the sequel to 2018's standalone superhero/villain film ""Venom"". Once again starring Tom Hardy in the lead role and this time joined by Woody Harrelson, it is a notable improvement over the original despite not being a difficult task.One year after the events of the first film, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is still working as a journalist while also tolerating the alien symbiote Venom sharing his body. Eddie is soon required to conduct another interview with detained serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who is now on death row. After the interview has been completed, Venom is able to deduce precisely where Cletus has hidden his victim's bodies, which boosts Eddie's journalistic career significantly. On the day of Cletus's execution, things go terribly wrong as a red symbiote emerges from him and breaks them both free from prison. This new symbiote refers to himself as Carnage and strikes a deal where if Cletus is able to help him find Eddie/Venom, Carnage will help Cletus reunite with his estranged girlfriend.Honestly, I wasn't all that fussed on the 2018 film ""Venom"". The whole movie felt like a watered down, tonally inept, oddly paced origin story of an iconic Marvel supervillain. Considering how sinister the character is supposed to be, I was constantly wishing that the film was R-rated and had really let loose on the gory detail. With that said, I am willing to admit there were some positive traits that I enjoyed, like how they nailed Venom's physical appearance, voice, and personality. Fortunately, most of the aforementioned issues have been addressed in the sequel, as things feel much more consistent this time around, making it a successful follow-up to an otherwise disappointing original.It appears the filmmakers have listened to some of the feedback regarding the original's inconsistent tone. Instead of awkward attempts at comic relief, all of the humour here flowed naturally through the characters at the best of times, especially from Venom himself. I actually got some decent chuckles out of almost all of these scenes, as opposed to cringing at the cheesy jokes in the first film. Of course, there were some moments that were obviously aimed at younger audiences, which makes sense since this is still a PG-13 marketed movie. However, this outing seemed much better tailored to suit the tastes of both young and old viewers alike, rather than feeling all over the place.To my surprise, this film was directed by none other than Andy Serkis (yes, THAT Andy Serkis, a.k.a. Gollum). Under his helm, Serkis addresses the pacing issues in the original by keeping this one moving along at an almost breakneck speed. As a result, the film clocks in at a mere 97 minutes in length, much shorter than most other superhero movies, which are typically over two hours. Normally I would be dismissive of this type of movie being as short as it is but thanks to Serkis, virtually everything works out for the most part. Despite its short length, the film still manages to squeeze in just enough action, character drama, and genuine superhero fun to satisfy fans of the genre. In particular, the final climactic battle was handled well with the build up towards it feeling earned and not simply there for the sake of an elaborate action scene.In the first film, Tom Hardy's performance in the main role was one of its biggest strengths and that's also the case here with the sequel. Hardy is great at playing the duel role of the mild mannered Eddie and the hungry-for-action Venom. Their dynamic here is considerably more comedic, with Venom's eccentricities frequently clashing with Eddie's wish to get some peace and quiet. It's also amusing to see how characters from the previous film just accept that Eddie is now hosting an alien symbiote inside his body, simply treating it as a normal occurrence.But of course the real focus here has to be on Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Like with Venom, the effects used on Carnage look fantastic and Harrelson's dark take on the character helps emphasise this. Interestingly, I couldn't help but draw some parallels between Cletus Kasady and Mickey Knox, Harrelson's character in ""Natural Born Killers"". Both happen to be serial killers focused on by the media who would do anything to protect their significant other. Whether the decision to cast Harrelson based on that comparison was intentional or a mere coincidence is up for debate but it certainly adds a more threatening undercurrent to his presence in the film.Though I initially had my doubts, this sequel to a painfully mediocre original has proven that a character like Venom is fully capable of holding his own in these series of films. I still would have preferred to have seen a more gritty, R-rated continuation of his story, one where we could actually see him bite someone's head off onscreen, but I'm mostly happy with the direction this one has taken. I'm curious to see where things will go from here. Will Sony Pictures let this Venom appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or will they keep him as part of something separate altogether? I suppose we'll have to wait and see what happens over the next few years.I rate it 7/10.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

It fully embraces the cheesy 90s camp that many loved and derided about the first film. It can be fun, but also feels like we've advanced so much farther in the genre beyond this.This movie felt like a sprint. It's a quick 90 minutes that moves at lightning pace. Not much time is spent in the way of characterization, especially for Cletus Kasady. The Eddie and Venom bromance takes up most of the runtime, which is wise given that was the highlight of the first film.The plot is pretty generic and really only feels like it's there to set up the inevitable Venom-Carnage showdown.

726,61,CANpatbuck3664,Hardy Sells Out Again but Venom 2 Only Survives Because of Sheer Campy Fun,5/10,11 October 2021,"Most people who liked the first Venom (me included, it was a mixed but diverting effort) were in agreement that the most enjoyable part was watching Eddie and Venom goof on each other and their banter. I'm pleased to report that they actually listened to the fans and they included much more. A lot of the dialogue is off kilter and hammy but it also delivered the only laughs I got in the movie. Tom Hardy is trying his best again, he's less of an action hero and more of a comedian in this one and while a lot of his material falls flat, some of it did land.Leading into the performances, although his effort was consistent, a lot of Hardy's performance was undercut by how goofy and poorly stitched together the rest of the movie was. He's an extremely talented actor and its cool he got a story credit but he couldn't punch his way through this. Woody Harrelson looked really bad in the marketing, it wasn't his fault though. His acting still dialed up way too high on the overdone scale but how they choose to use his character is bizarre, there's so little character motivation for his clash with Eddie Brock and his subplot with Frances is so undercooked, I just can't put that on him. Speaking of Frances, how did they get Naomi Harris for this role? She gets nothing to do, her character is poorly written and she's all over the place. I've liked her so much in other things, I just felt terrible for her. Ditto for Stephen Graham as Detective Mulligan, he's shown up in some terrible stuff before but there wasn't a chance here with how half baked his character was. Lastly, Michelle Williams is back but she's an afterthought and other than some of the random hi jinx, she's given nothing to do.The first Venom was pretty reliant on the CGI for the action, I thought it was pretty good actually but Venom 2 largely offers more of the same. I wouldn't say they're bad or even lacklustre but serviceable is accurate. Carnage is affected by the dramatic side of the movie so when he starts throwing stuff around and causing havoc, its not emotionally wrenching but it looks okay.I've listed as many positives as I can, Venom's achilles heel is the story and its handling of the characters. Small issues right? With how they handle Cletus/Carnage there's almost no conflict, its also the same with Venom and Eddie. There's no serious threat to their friendship or their partnership and while their bickering is amusing, it doesn't amount to a story. Let alone what they do with Frances and Detective Mulligan, it all amounts to a giant mess. I don't know if I've ever seen such a high budget movie that had so much work into it that was so slapdash and carelessly thrown together from a story perspective.If I were to take any kind of emotion out of it, Venom: Let There Be Carnage would be up there with Old and Wonder Woman 1984 as the biggest misfires I've seen lately. Lucky for Venom 2, there is such a things as being enjoyably bad. There a lot of campy gold here and it sustained me through the rest of the crap. So while I can't recommend seeing it in theatres, if you're into so-bad-its-good movies, this could be worth a watch. I'm not sure if I want a 3rd one though, there was a lot of potential after the original Venom, if this is the direction they chose to go, maybe its best to call it quits.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Thats what we told ourselves about the first one. Oh it wasnt' that bad. But thats because we imagined it was better than it was. Yes we all love Venom and Carnage...but clearly this is not them. Not even close..it only looks like them and is that enough to succeed. With that logic it could be venom and carnage having a pissing contest for an hour and a half and you would still love it?

The 90-minute runtime forces the movie to tell no important story at all (Venom does almost nothing).

But I also noticed that the first half hour of the movie is a bit tedious and way too talkative before the real action kicks in; that the story is wafer-thin, as well as all characters next to Tom Hardy's; and to be honest: that even Hardy's Eddy Brock doesn't leave any lasting impression. So after some amusing 89 minutes I got up, threw my popcorn box in the bin and picked my life up as if nothing special had happened. Which in fact was the case.

734,69,statuskuo,My Brother The Alien,5/10,2 October 2021,"Okay, never saw the first one, so take that into account.This film meanders a lot. And towards the end, you wonder why it was ever made. Oh, right...because the first one made a kajillion dollars. Now I don't fault producer/story by/lead actor/caterer/most likely lighting technician why they chose to do a sequel, only that it is a bizarre rambling flick.The story is of a reporter (?) who is being requested by serial killer Kletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) to document his last days on Earth as he is about to be executed. When he bites the hand of Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) he obtains the blood of Venom and escapes to find...a girl who he had met in some insane asylum 25 years earlier.Well, the girl is Shriek (Naomi Harris) an X-Men like ""freak"" who builds a romance while being incarcerated. To a point where they are bound to find each other as the tale unfolds. Does it matter? Meh.There are a few logical questions here...A) were they children when he met and now spend time in a mental institution together? In which case, how is it he is able to commit serial killing while released? Maybe I missed something there.Also, B) though Kletus is told she'd been killed by a cop during her transfer to an underground research facility, what was the point of just telling him she was alive? What purpose does that serve? Yeah, not that lame of a loose end. But still nagged me.Well, most of the story is of the relationship between Venom and Eddie. They are the oddest couple you can imagine. They bicker like an old married couple and also attempt to cheer on another up when need be. None of this translates to actual fun...but director Andy Serkis still attempts to shoehorn your typical Marvel movie glib jokes in. Ugh. It gets very monotonous and creepy. I mean...they share a body.All chaos breaks loose as Kletus and Shriek wreck havoc to find the people who kept them apart. None of which explains why Red Venom has so much hate for Venom. And you do get to see Harrelson's return to Micky (from ""Natural Born Killers"") joyful brutality. It's not as fun as it sounds.Perhaps what hurts the most is that, it really goes a long way to convince you why this movie needed to be made. No real reason I can think of to continue the story. Hardy is decent. Though his Aussi accent peeks through a lot. Surprised that a movie this caliber dropped the ball on it. But this isn't meant to be much more than a stopping point for, maybe, another installment. Surprisingly bland.It may have done better if they'd went full ""R"" instead of a ""PG-13""",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
735,70,sbweightman,"Flat humour, dull action scenes and a rushed production.",3/10,18 October 2021,"A poor movie which rushes through its simple story with overly familiar themes and apart from the post-credit scene, has no surprises. A lot of the numerous jokes fall flat, the switching between emotional drama and comedy is jarring and the lack of gore and gratuitous violence in the action scenes makes it very tame to watch. The creature effects looked great, but the final fight between the 2 monsters was underwhelming with a lot of the backgrounds being blurry. The acting was ok, but I was mostly bored by it.

736,71,danielmanson,So much carnage,7/10,25 October 2021,"I knew midway through watching this film that it was going to be very polarising with the audience. It's a plot that definitely divides, the comedy might not be to your taste, the characters might not be for you and the plot might be either too tame or too extreme. Below is my personal thoughts, bare in mind it's from the view of someone that enjoys marvel films and watches a lot of them, but not keen enough to give a toss about the marvel universe. (Skip to final para if you can't be arsed with the in depth).The Comedy: I personally found the comedy element to work really well. I sniggered a good few times and I don't think it was overdone and used in a way that didn't affect the plot.The plot: the plot I found ok. It focused a little too much on the character arcs of Eddie and Venom, it wasn't offputting or anything drastic, but I feel like we could have got more from it. Seemed to lack that ""wow"" factor. But overall it's definitely watchable and not overly confusing or challenging. You can sit back and relax and just simply watch with ease.Special mention to Woody Harrelson who I thought did a really good job. The character Frances I found really jarring and I just could not get into it. I can't overly pinpoint why, but from the get go she was dead annoying and couldn't be bothered whenever she was on screen.The CGI overall was done really well on the whole. Maybe a couple of minor dodgy moments, but when you have a film so heavily reliant on CGI then it's bound to happen. But overall I was impressed.Overall, the reason I think people will be very polarised on this, is because the plot just isn't very meaningful. It's a lot of carnage and nothing else too much on value. I personally liked that as I could sit back and just zone out almost and watch a fun film. The films comedic elements will also be a little opposing as peoples sense of humour will always be different. But it's harmless jokes and fun.If you like your heroes to have humour, like a lot of action and enjoy Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson then it's 100% worth a watch and you will enjoy. 7/10 from me.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
737,72,Xavier_Stone,Not a good sequel,2/10,6 October 2021,"2 stars for Tom Hardy trying to support this entire film. I liked the first Venom but this is nothing but filler. Woody gives it a decent shot but it's way off the mark and the plot is straightforward and expected.There are tons of ways to script a sequel to a popular movie. These writers took the most obvious and easy way to complete it. It feels like a teen could have written this and was passed off as original.Poor performances all around.

738,73,sweidman-28016,Not Quite There,6/10,10 October 2021,"""All I ever wanted in this circus of hell is carnage.""In Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution. The first Venom did not do it for me as well as many others. It split audiences into those who really liked it and those who hated it. It felt like there was no middle ground. But with the change in directors and the thought of Carnage being part of this story, it did bring me to want to go out and see it. And though this may have got somewhere that the first didn't, it didn't get to where I would've liked to have seen it go. Here, it embraces campiness and doesn't take itself as seriously as the first. I feel like they were trying to make up for last time. As campy as it tried to be, I don't think it quite understood how to utilize it. For me, the beginning and end embraced it the most. When it did, I found myself sort of enjoying it. We saw this with Malignant last month, but this is another movie that feels like it could've been some b-movie found in the back of a video store. Had it not tried to force itself to be comedic and take some things as serious as it did, maybe it could've gotten to that level. Mainly, it's the story that disappoints. There's so much to unpack and they do so in around 90 minutes. I love the runtime, but it moves by so fast there is literally no room to breathe. There's hardly a quiet moment. After some time I just wanted a break.Somewhere within the second act, the movie kind of loses what it's trying to be. The story becomes messy and can't decide where to go. Most of the comedy takes place in here and some of it does land. This whole section is like a side plot that could've worked elsewhere. Tom Hardy pulls this movie together. You know that he loves being Eddie and Venom and wants to make the most of it. Woody Harrelson is a good addition to the franchise, but I don't think his character was nearly fleshed out as he could've been. Carnage has some big shoes to fill, and though the movie doesn't do him justice, the fight scenes are great. The action is a lot of fun, though it can be too much. Everything turns to CGI, but much like Godzilla Vs. Kong, we're in it for the action scenes. I will note the production design, especially in the last act looks great. They had the right atmosphere going to match this haunted looking church. Maybe it's just me, but it put me in the spirit for Halloween. Overall, this didn't live up to the hype. It felt more like a filler movie within the franchise, besides the great after credit scene. I was entertained and everyone in the theater was too. But if you're looking at the story, it's rushed, messy, and not all that great. Andy Serkis had the right idea and so did most apart of it, but they couldn't quite get to where they wanted to be.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
739,74,dfle3,Venom: Let there be foolhardy. 72.5+%,7/10,26 November 2021,"Where the adventures of an alien life form from outer space known as ""Venom"", which is cohabiting in the body of previously unremarkable journalist Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy), continue. Eddie seems otherwise normal but when danger arises, Venom may protrude from his body or even transform him into Venom in order to deal with it. This time the plot concerns how the reckless actions of Venom gives rise to a new foe which scares even Venom himself. Why that fear should exist in him (it?) is glossed over in the film but perhaps is explained in some other medium in which the characters exists, like comics or whatever, so, in that sense, it excludes the casual viewer of this film.The principal antagonist is Cletus Kasady (played by Woody Harrelson). With Frances Barrison (played by Naomi Harris), they are star-crossed lovers, following a well-worn trajectory: boy meets girl, girl is forced into high-security detention due to an X-Men kind of superhero ability, boy becomes even more of a mass murderer than he was before and...you can guess the rest, I'm sure.I saw a trailer for this film in the cinema a few weeks back and it looked interesting enough to take a chance by seeing it, even though I hadn't seen the original film in this new franchise which is, no doubt, the origin story of the Brock/Venom pairing (not quite as formidable a pairing as Brock/Richards or Brock/Perkins but still). Generally I found the film amusing enough for the odd couple antics of Brock/Venom. Well, since I've never seen the TV series ""The odd couple"", maybe the better analogy is to invoke the antics of an old couple which bickers most of the time. Most of the humour comes from Venom but maybe I only understood what he said about two thirds of the time, due to the special effects applied to generate his voice. There's violence in the film but I don't remember it being too shocking (I saw this today), however, if you are squeamish, I suppose the appearance of Venom out of Brock could be a bit much for some although it's more anodyne body horror than anything else. Otherwise there's really not to much to wag your finger about. There was frequent talk of ""brains"" in the film but, again, any horror or violence is only intimated. The ""M"" rating the film has in Australia is appropriate.If you can say that the narrative arc of Kasady and Barrison is shown here, maybe you can also say that other characters' origin stories as superpowered are also shown but once again, I'd guess that to get full value from those scenes, you'd need to be immersed in the lore of this world from other media, like comics etc.Maybe others will get more value from the Kasady/Barrison narrative arc than I did and rate this film higher than me. Which is not to say that I don't realise that Kasady does raise a fair point to Brock late in the film. This film was entertaining enough but even the usual Marvel teaser during the end credits didn't leave me with the desire to see the next Venom film. I do have a vague recollection of that original film being received negatively by audiences and critics, which was confirmed by looking at the Wikipedia page for it in writing this review. That being said, I might be interested in seeing that Venom origin story...and I missed the chance to record it on FTA commercial TV the other day...so...maybe next time? I would hazard a guess that the humour works better in this first sequel, in any case...although...I found the character of Doctor Dan (played by Reid Scott) a wet blanket in this film.

So disappointing.I never really rated the CG in the first film, I think the Venom character looked cool but didn't quite fit too well with live action. When you add in Carnage as well it was all a bit too CG heavy.The plot was meh. I can see what they were trying to do and it wasn't bad, but was instantly forgettable. Woody Harrelson (who is a terrific actor) was quite bad in this and his villain was a bit tired and bland.In terms of action it was a bit thin on the ground and the final big fight scene was fine I guess. Again not bad but instantly forgettable.What more can I say really.

748,83,jakethesnake-42007,Meh at best,5/10,2 October 2021,"Mediocre at best is what I can say about this film. There is so much going on and the story is to fast for any character development. Stretch was a pointless character and did nothing in the plot. Woody Harrison was a miscast and they could of done so much more with the character. There's moments yes but it's not enough to make it a good film.

director: Andy Serkis
starring: Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, Reid Scott, Stephan Graham, Peggy Lu etcoverall rating 46/100Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution. What an absolute mess this was.Let's be nice and start with some positives as there was some. The character background and set up was solid. As well as great cinematography and humour. As well as the performances and chemistry the characters. I thought the background and set up involving Carnage (Woody Harrelson) and Shriek (Naomie Harris) despite being rushed was solid. It established clear motivations for carnage and set out a clear darker tone, whilst also serving as a good introduction to how unstable Cletus is as a character. I also thought the cinematography was strong for this film. Considering the film had essentially the same budget as the first film they paid a lot more attention to detail. The film was visually stunning, and visually creative with the great character designs especially for carnage. I also thought the humour for the most part landed well. The film had witty, fast paced jokes that kept you laughing a lot of the time. The film embraced its campiness with its characters and the humour, and I enjoyed it. This was largely helped by the fantastic on-screen chemistry between Eddie and Venom. They are just infectious and hilarious to watch as there back and forth interactions were always a highlight to watch. Plus, the performances from Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris were fun. They delivered passionate and campy performances and just looked like they were enjoying playing the characters.However, my first few negatives would be the terrible pacing. Lack of character depth or development. The poor script and over reliance on comedy. The film was all over the place in terms of pacing. It needed to be at least 20 minutes longer. Coming in at 97 minutes the film moved at such a frantic and messy pace, it never allowed anything to breathe or leave any room for any form of development. It felt like lazy writing as there was so many plot holes and it felt like the writers were cutting corners just for the sake of it. Because of this there was a complete lack or character depth. It was one dimensional and lazy. And any attempt at development or depth just felt like copy and paste from the first film and it bought nothing new to the table. The script itself for me just felt lazy, poorly structured and the humour especially became tedious. It became so over-relied on that it just got annoying after a while. The script fell into countless genre tropes that it didn't even try to escape from.My final few positives would be the action, strong horror elements. The fun villain and great end credit scene. I thought the action scenes that we did get were great. They were entertaining, thrilling and had great horror elements to them particularly with Carnages powers, I wish they had used more horror. As the moments of horror we did get were so strong with carnage. I thought Carnage as a villain was strong. The film found a good balance of campy and over the top, but also making Cletus very unstable. He was undoubtedly fun to watch whenever he was on screen and Woody Harrelson did a great job. And of course the end credit scene was great, setting up a lot of future implications for Venom as a character and it was an exciting set up.My final few negatives would be the underused elements. The lack of connection with venom and carnage in the plot. As well as generic elements and a messy final act. The film lacked any form of focus or development of one particularly thing. The characters were underdeveloped. The use of horror which would have been so strong for a character like Carnage felt wasted. And the characters were underused especially Anne (Michelle Williams) she could have been used so much more and given some depth to Eddie, but it just felt repetitive. The film was also generic and fell into so many genre tropes in the final act. They made Anne a damsel in distress and an innocent needing to be saved. It was lazy, very poor in terms of representation and it really frustrated me. The final act despite its entertaining moments was a mess with the complete lack of motivation for Carnage to go against Venom there was a complete lack of anything really connecting either character to each other. Cletus's goal was to reunite with Shriek, and it felt like that was it, so it was a waste of his character and the end credit scene only proved that.Overall, Venom: Let there be carnage is for the most part entertaining. And boasts strong visuals, committed performances and the chemistry between Eddie and Venom is undeniably charming. But this film was lazy, rushed and frankly a complete mess. And tried to do too many things at once, therefore it lost itself.Overall rating 46/100.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
750,85,gavinp9,"Again, fun enough, but nothing substantial",6/10,19 November 2021,"'Venom: Let There Be Carnage', the second non-MCU Venom film, sees alien symbiote Venom and Eddie Brock (Hardy) learning how to share the same body. The film introduces Cletus Kasady (Harrelson) as a disturbed killer and his partner Frances (Harris) early on, before focusing on the odd-couple relationship of Venom/Eddie for the first act, which is quite fun. Anne (Williams) and Dan (Scott) are back as Eddie's ex and her new partner.Mulligan (Graham) is the cop trying to figure out what's going on with Eddie and has a link to Kasady & Frances. Besides Tom & Woody - both good to see having fun with their characters - no-one really gets much screen time, but things move along very quickly (only ~90min total), as the final showdown when Kasady becomes ""Carnage"" inevitably happens.Some solid CGI, which is required, but a poor soundtrack and a bit of a nothing plot. Feel like we needed more Dan & Mrs Chen (Lu) - the comedy aspects are done quite well and some of the action is good, but there's nothing really new or too exciting. End credits scene is worth waiting for.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

752,87,flicklover,Ho-hum sequel.,5/10,3 October 2021,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first Venom film tgat came out in 2018 but it was very funny mostly due to Tom Hardy's frantically comic performance as Eddie Brock/Venom. It was what was. A rated R comic book film with a more black comedic edge. Not bad, but not terribly memorable. Now with Venom: Let There Be Carnage we get more of the same only this ti e the film goes for pure camp. It has virtually no story. The villain, Cleatus Kasaday which turns into Carnage is played with over the top glee by Woody Harrelson. He is a serial killer on death row that wants to give Eddie an exclusive interview and reveal certain facts about his murders. He bites Eddie at one point thus ingesting a small part of Venom so he becomes a red symbiote. Carnage. More or less we know the rest. Most of the film which us pretty short at about 90 minutes spends most of its running time with Eddue and Venom's back and forth banter that was also present in the first film. It's funny at times but becomes repetitive. Michelle Williams is back as Anne, Eddie's ex fuance who shows up to tell Eddie she is engaged. All of this comes to a head once Carnage shows up. Venom separates from. Eddie after an argument and tries to join with other humans but they all die. Eventually these two rejoin to fight Carnage. It's all done with the typical CGI pyrotechnics and it us entertaining but the film is so jokey and light that you don't really care about what's happening on screen. Woody Harrelson is funny but not really menacing as Cletus. So really no sense of danger or stakes to be memorable. The first film was better in that at least there was some semblance of plot and stakes for the characters.Uninspired sequel.Grade: C.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
753,88,movieman6-413-929510,"Comedic action scenes in the second Venom movie, but unfortunately a lesser script.",6/10,22 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the sequel to Venom. The film is directed by Andy Serkis, the director of Breath and Mowgli.In the film, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) still lives in the same body with symbiote Venom. Eddie tries to revive his journalism career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) in order to find more clues about the murders he is suspected of. When Kasady attacks him, he also gets a symbiote called Carnage and knows break out of jail and cause mayhem, Eddie and Venom must now make up their differences and stop Carnage.After the first Venom movie, this sequel is making a movie that fans have been waiting for, as they now use the character Carnage. Director Andy Serkis has experience in conveying characters with multiple personalities in the same body, having become famous for playing the character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film series.Because of his position as a director, he helps to properly transfer the effects in the film. Because he has looked at most scenes with an eye for detail, the symbiote scenes also come across more believable in this film compared to the first film. He knows how to provide entertaining action scenes. He also helps Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson play their dual roles in the film.The weakest point of the film is unfortunately the story, because that was largely conceived and written by Kelly Marcel alone. In other films she has worked with others on the film scripts and has independently written the screenplay for Fifty Shades of Grey.This is reflected in this film. Fortunately, the comic moments come across well, because she got help from Tom Hardy here. The romantic scenes that play a major role in the film appear weaker, so that the viewer doesn't really care about the romantic scenes. The ending is also a bit rushed. Tom Hardy comes across well and believable again in the dual role of Eddie Brock and Venom. The two characters come across as a couple stuck together in the same body and trying to make the best of it even though they don't always agree. Woody Harrelson has been seen by fans as the perfect casting for the role of Cletus Kasady and Carnage since acting in the movie Natural Born Killers. He manages to portray the role in the film in an appropriate and comical way, but he is a bit counteracted by the lesser script. Michelle Williams and Naomie Harris play their roles well in the film, but if they had been given less time in the film, the lead roles would have had more time. This could have made the movie a little better.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
754,89,ayoreinf,Understanding the nature of the beast,8/10,1 November 2021,"Sometimes I wonder if I saw the same movie other reviewers write about. So many here say it had no plot or if it did have any, it was a mess none could make any sense of. Well the movie I saw had a very straightforward plot which I followed without any difficulty and the people watching it with me didn't seem to complain. Yes I do agree, the acting was top notch. I will mention Tom Hardy who does superbly as Eddie Brock, and seems to be the voice of Venom too, which is one of the best voice acting I've seen (or heard) in a very long time. Another one that deserves mentioning is Woody Harrelson who seems to enjoy playing psychotic killers and gives a stellar performance as the tormented but utterly deranged Cletus Kasady. All the others are very good too or at least very professional. The movie follows the first installment's most important aspect (in my personal book) that is the savage nature of Venom is here straight from the comics books just as he was originally conceived and for me, that deserves special appreciation. The writers and creators of this movie, like those who started the franchise do understand the nature of the beast - the entire thing wouldn't be worthy of our time without this understanding.Regarding the sense of humor demonstrated throughout the movie - it's always very dark and wry humor, never a LOL but rather some wry smiles or maybe a chuckle here and there. I don't think LOL comedy would suit this movie, while the wry dark humor suits it to perfection.Bottom line - that's Venom - violent, savage, dark and maybe a bit chaotic, but not in a way that makes it impossible to follow and understand. That's the nature of the beast, as I said already - the entire movie makes sense only this way and I like it if only for the fact it dares going through with this bizarre type of hero all the way.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage
755,90,dasa108,It made me miss Sam Raimi's Venom,3/10,14 October 2021,"Let's do some history. For a hero or anti-hero to have a decent story at least there has to be a story, a motivation, and also a worthwhile villain. In this case they managed to destroy Spiderman's most important villain (Carnage) by including him in a story where the producers, screenwriters and director did not know what to do. The big mistakes: repeat villain; the villain of the first Venom and the one in this film are almost the same. Cletus Kassidy's lover does not use the name Shriek (her character's name) and does not even use all the powers that correspond to her according to the canon. Woody Harrelson's look varies between Venom 1 to Venom 2 which marks a disaster in the aesthetic continuity of the character. Venom's character becomes increasingly unbearable and doesn't generate any sympathy at all. So much so that one begins to miss the Raimi version of this character. Considering the derivation of the character, it is absolutely correct to affirm that Venom will never be able to star in a decent movie since the scripts are by rule horrible, the direction lackluster, the production is not ambitious and the attachment to respect the legacy of the character is non-existent.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

757,92,dommercaldi,Venom: Let There Be Crap,3/10,16 October 2021,"Pros:
1. The CGI looks good which helps to prevent Carnage (Woody Harrelson) and Venom (Tom Hardy) from becoming too cartoonish.2. Both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson provide as good as a performance as they can.3. There is fantastic chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Tom Hardy, which makes it a shame that there aren't more scenes with them two in.Cons:
1. The pacing is horribly rushed, as story-lines and conflicts are introduced and then resolved almost instantly.2. The character conflicts are exceedingly flimsy and thus uninteresting, for example that between Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) wherein they fall out of an engagement (which lasts about a minute), but in the next scene they have together they're friends again.3. The writing is incredibly lazy and it's clear that not much thought went into it. An example of this would be when Venom and Eddie Brock rally to defeat Carnage and Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) by uttering the cliche that they're stronger together than apart (even though their fallout was violent and Eddie Brock forces Venom to fundamentally change his diet, whilst claiming that Carnage and Cletus Kasady aren't symbiotic even though the inverse is true for them.4. There are too many forced conflicts which take screen-time away from the more interesting conflicts and story-lines.5. The comedy is hit and miss, but mostly miss as it felt that it was largely for immature audiences.6. Considering that this movie was about Venom and Carnage (two ravenous man-eaters), in addition to a prolific serial killer featuring and child abuse being brought up, this movie should have aimed for an R-rating but instead it played it safe and thus was more boring than it should have been.7. The movie was a little tonally all over-the-place as it kept introducing humour into the serious moments which cheapened said serious moments immensely.8. Despite there being few relevant characters to the story, most of them are still given barely anything to do.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

762,97,darkreignn,Works best when it's trying to be a comedy,6/10,3 October 2021,"As ironic and unexpected as it may be, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" works best when it's attempting to be a comedy. To be quite honest, I found this film funnier than any mainstream comedic film that's been released in the past couple of years; one scene in particular in which Venom was attempting to make Eddie Brock cry had me rolling in my seat, practically crying of laughter myself. Make no mistake, this sequel takes the camp and goofiness of the original and amplifies to a degree so absurd that if you find yourself unable to adapt, you'll certainly despise this film.However, I enjoyed the silliness of the first act - it was genuinely funny, filled with slapstick comedy and great chemistry between Venom and Eddie. And if you enjoy this type of comedy, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. However, if you came into this film to see action, and I'm assuming most people will have that same desire when they're buying a ticket to this movie, then you'll be very disappointed.There is barely any action in this film, and when there is, it's as watered down as my father's whiskey on the rocks after leaving it to sit on the table for two hours. You may have heard director Andy Serkis say that this film ""pushes the PG-13 rating to its very limits,"" and that's a bigger joke than any gags present in this movie. The violence is so bland that it's practically directionless; everyone's favorite Spider-Man villain, Carnage, is about as threatening as a Build-a-Bear plushie. Sure, you see him cause a little havoc, but it's nothing too graphic, or disturbing, or menacing, especially when compared to ""The Dark Knight,"" a superhero movie that actually did push the PG-13 rating to its limit.So, if you're not getting good action, what are you getting? A good time. Like I said, this movie is so silly that I found it practically impossible not to have a grin on my face for the majority of its run time. And even though I did find myself disappointed with the lack of grit, I was entertained enough to look past that and roll with the punches.",Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Because in Japan it was released in 1996, so one would think they would use that year - but hey that would be nitpicking. Also if you think one or more of the characters do not exactly look like the individuals you played ... well it does not copy everything from the game.But still, this is as close an adaptation of the first game (and maybe some other elements from other movies thrown in for good measure) as it gets. And I was going ""finally"" while I watched this. The first time I saw the dog ... the dog scene that scared me as much as a scene can scare someone. The dog will not have the same scene as it had in the game - but one similar enough to really make me happy. Well you know what I mean.But back to the beginning of the movie and the backstory of our two siblings. This could have been a completely different movie/franchise they shot right there. One closer to Annabelle or something similar - quite spooky and it might throw some people off. But one that sets quite the mood for the rest of the film. And shows off that this may have a lot of gunplay (later on), but still considers itself to be more horror than action. Well played - if you excuse the pun.There is enough backstory to keep you interested and invested in those involved - of course you cannot get into all the details of every individual. But you don't have too. Conversations are quite good and the stingers really hit their mark. Again with the puns, I know.If you are a fan of the games you will recognize that those involved really loved them too. It shows - and it also shows (apart from a lot of graphic violence) a story worth being investigated further ... as in sequels. And for that stay tuned during the credits for one added scene! Thank you for finally giving me the movie that almost was done 20 years ago.Edit: I think it is clear above, but I wanted to add, that those unfamiliar with the original game (and the ones coming after them probably, but especially the first one) may have major issues as I witnessed after the movie was over. The style/tone change from the beginning/intro to what the movie then becomes is quite major. Still this is how the game felt. And even in the introduction of the main characters and Raccoon City as a whole, you do see glimpses that give away the game. The umbrella logo to name just one.And little gifts like that or callbacks from the game(s) are more than welcome (the very first ""encounter"" in the house with the back to us ... chilling and as genius and good as in the game, the text messages, map etc). For those in the know - again I can't talk about those unfamiliar ... but they too can enjoy a very dark mood with a driven and goal orientated story and location!

766,3,cruise01,Fun bloody thrills with a different take to the franchise.,10/10,26 November 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City is an awesome horror film based on the video game series. And a reboot to the franchise. Taking the direction back to Raccoon City and at the beginning before the outbreak. I love Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films which is more loosely based on the games. But more action packed. However, this reboot is way different than those films. This film does have a horror movie feel with its tone, direction, music, and does try for some cheap scares.I am a huge fan of the video game series. I took the last several films for what it was. But it was not even close to the games. This reboot is closer to the games but still completely different with Johannes Roberts script and direction. Its more of one fourth with the similarities to the games. While the story and direction takes off to a different path. I guess we can assume films will never be close to the game adaptations. Fans will somewhat enjoy this for what it is.The settings of Spencers Mansion was awesome. That part of the film was great and created an intense and scary tone. While the police station setting was looking similar but strays away with the story direction.The story is good. It does merge the first two game settings into one story which is great and bad at same time. It does feel rushed. The spencer setting with Chris (Robbie Amell), Jill (Hannah John-Kamen), and Wesker (Tom Hopper) investigating murder attacks near the mansion. They search the mansion and come across the undead. Which this part of the movie was intense and scary. Chris battling through undead in dark corridors. Fans will be happy with this part of the movie.The second part of the story is Claire (Kaya Scodelario) coming back to her hometown to break the news about Umbrella to her brother Chris. She runs across to Leon (Avan Jogia). Leon being a rookie cop. While being stuck in the police station with people in the town turning into the undead. Fans will be a little disappointed with the second game concept in this movie. Which was not as scary as the Spencer mansion setting.The films setting adaptation is great. Story is indifferent. Spencers Mansion sequence is thrilling. Police station setting is slow and suspense building. There are zombie dogs, a brief scene with a licker monster, Lisa Trevor which is a different take with her from the games. And a boss from the second game which was cool but short.The movie is awesome. It has action and some intense sequences that makes it entertaining and worth watching if you're a fan or looking for a thrilling zombie film. The visual effects are decent with its limited budget. The cast ensemble is great. Every one worked with there characters. I did feel a little indifferent with Leon (Avan Jogia) which the script did take his rookie personality to a whole new level of being dumb.The film does set up for a sequel. And hoping they can adapt it even closer to games. This film is close to it. There is a mid credit scene that hints for another film with a specific character.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
767,4,stevendbeard,See How It All Started,8/10,26 November 2021,"I saw Resident Evil:Welcome to Raccoon City, starring Kaya Scodelario-the Maze Runner movies, Clash of the Titans_2010; Robbie Amell-The Flash_tv, Cheaper By the Dozen 2; Neal McDonough-The Flash_tv, Paul Blart:Mall Cop 2 and Tom Hopper-Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, Game of Thrones_tv.This is a reboot of the Resident Evil series and it's based more on the video games, specifically, the first two. It's also an origin story, as you get to see how it all started. Kaya & Robbie are brother & sister, who-when they were kids-had the misfortune to be in the orphanage that Neal was using as an experimental playground back in 1998. Kaya & Robbie avoid being test subjects-she runs away & he becomes a cop-but years later, Kaya returns to check on her brother. She finds more than she anticipated. The Umbrella Corporation was centered in Raccoon City and they pretty much turn the city into a ghost town-with all the experimenting and such going on-with very few people still living there. Tom plays a fellow cop to Robbie on the small police department. When the Umbrella organization decides to clean house-which includes leveling the city-the clock is ticking on Kaya, Robbie, Tom and any other living survivor to get out of town alive. There is a scene right as the end credits start-a character's connection to future movies is shown-but there is nothing at the very end.It's rated R for violence, gore and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

Cowardice, corruption and complete incompetence seem to be the defining characteristics of the medical, law enforcement and welfare systems here.

769,6,rgkarim,Trying To Welcome the Gamers to The Reboot,7/10,24 November 2021,"LIKES:The Atmosphere:
If you have played a Resident Evil game, at least most of them, then you will know that the game is a horror element that was the master of jump scares. I can say that this film tries to mirror the element of the first game to the letter, working hard to use the quiet spaces, shadows, and off camera angles to pull you back into the game that started it all. It does a fantastic job sort of recreating the feel of Racoon City, tying all the players into their respective areas and recreating the scenery the PlayStation created years ago. It works well, and feels like a video game to an extent, which makes a nerd like me feel very welcome.The Pace:
To some degree, the pace wins points, because it is not bogged down by the usual introduction sluggishness that origin movies can be. Racoon City gets right to the appetizers to tempt you to stay, and keeps serving you the courses of Zombies that will deliver what the target audience was coming in for. This pace will continue for most of the movie, and offer little down time to get sidetracked on, so plan your drinks and food accordingly.The Action Feels Resident Evil:
The first movie series made our lead character a Matrix like ninja in the world of Resident Evil, which many of my friends liked. However, this movie tones that action down and instead gives you a closer representation of what is involved in the game. It's not super jumps, fists punches, and gun tricks made famous in the Western genre. No, Racoon City is all about the heroes having to aim their shots, choose their tools, and conserve ammo, as they semi-explore the world they are trapped in as the countdown timer continues tick away. While not the most exciting for most of the time, it does accomplish more of the feel of Resident Evil, which again makes the gamer in me very happy, while the movie goer a little sad at not getting more strategy.Funny:
Often unintentional, but sometime timed well, Racoon City happens to have some comedy on hand to get a chuckle or two out of me. Whether it's the quick wit of the two leads mouthing off, the incompetence of several members somehow making their bad luck work, or even the throwback to the 90s, you'll find a good laugh here in this film. Resident Evil's Racoon City certainly offers some fun moments to skirt by break up the montage of horror elements that are crammed into this movie.The Acting:
I'm sort of mixed on this, but given the material they had to work with, I think most of the people accomplished the roles they were set out to do. The Kaya Scodelario has the survival-horror lead down as Claire, she's tough, gusty, and resourceful, and has a bit of the tortured soul performance down quite well. I wanted more time with her, but she works well with the cast she is thrown into and again is a good role for her. Robbie Amell as Chris is fine to be honest, gun toting and the bravado that 90s cop role made famous in its action hero days. It's stereotypical and rather one dimensional, but again works for me in the long run. Hannah Joh-Kamen is a more modern twist on Jill, and I like the promise of her, but can't say the execution was the fullest extent to the character I know from the games. Again, more time needed with her, but the parts she did get to shine were rather bright and fun to watch. Avan Jogia, plays a certain spin on the character I remember from the games, and given the direction they gave him... he accomplishes the funny bit for me. I had fun with the dude and he made his awkwardness work for the role, even though again he does not match the rogue we know from the series.The Nostalgia:
This seems to be the selling point hot trend, but Resident Evil accomplishes immersing you back into the feel of the game, or should I say games. Both first and second games are merged in this movie, and with it comes plenty of things that make you want to replay the games once again. Certain landmarks are made very prominent early on in the game, alongside those famous Easter Eggs fanboys like me love hunting for as the movie unfolds. Classic looks of the guns, the feel and sound of the zombies, and even several of the puzzles are referenced in this game and it works super well. The computer animation and makeup have given you a few of the enemies that may give you goosebumps, but Racoon City accomplishes the goal of bringing so much back, that it should get fans clapping for the fun at hand.DISLIKES:
The Pace;
Wait, what? Yes, I liked the pace for an entertainment perspective, but from a story perspective it suffered for me. Racoon City's movement feels much like a Syfy channel movie, where there are few breaks or times to really give us the elements of solving the mystery or getting out of a jam. Character introductions, action scenes, and more suffer because we are trying to keep it all balanced and it was a bit of hinderance for the overall quality.Not Scary for the Most Part:
Most likely I'm desensitized, but the movie is not the horror movie of the year as some may advertise on the posters or reviews. Most of the film accidentally comes off comedic, thanks to the dialogue writing, and with so much of the stuff moving so quickly, you don't really get time to drink in the horror or use the techniques that the game did so well. I know 20 hours vs 1.5 makes a big difference, but advertising as horror means trying to keep that atmosphere alive and keep me on the edge in some way. Did it have its moments? Of course, but the fast pace mentioned dilutes the full experience and we are kind of left with a Meh moment.The Dialogue:
Why the F word continues to reign king of being overused, I don't know. Resident Evil is all about the F bomb and while it may not affect others, it again gets overdone that it loses the full blow that it normally has. Not only does it take the edge off the scary moments, but it's just stupid to think we could not come up with better wording or wittier writing that the game already set the stage with years ago.The Shadow use:
While it sets the stage and sort of hits the famous creep factor the first game did, the darker picture of the movie also took away from it as well. Much of the movie is an uglier amber, and often goes too dark or blacked out to get the full effects. The game of course did have darkness moments, but either getting to adjust your television, or the lighting sources they programmed in made up for that. In this film though, that was not accomplished for me and I'd have like a few work arounds, especially at the beginning to help alleviate the darkness.A little Too Much On the 90s:
A running gag, or maybe trying to set us back into the decade, Racoon City sometimes hit us over the head too much with the running gas of the past. Enjoyable at times sure, but the constant reminder of the tempered again got in the way of the story for this reviewer and tried too hard to be funny with it.The Story/Character Usage:
Hands down the worst part of the film is the story, not because it was not interesting, but because it was too crammed. There was a reason there are two games that exist to tell the events of the T-Virus' origin, so trying to cram them together in 1.5 hours was a bold move to say the least. Racoon City's story is very jumpy, with minimal transitions between the two to three story arcs in an attempt to pull everything together. All the build ups and gradual clue finding are rather lacking, the survival elements and character bonding are lackluster, with hasty banter to tell us they are close. I was not connected to many of these characters and would have liked more time to really enjoy their attempts to battle the horde that awaited them. Throw in more time with other common enemies to program in, and we may have had the right chemistry to really maximize the inclusion of everyone. Yet Racoon City's attempt to do so much, might have been a little more than could be handled.The VERDICT:
Overall, I had fun with Racoon City and found the video game movie enjoyable in how it kept to the roots of the game it's based on. It's got a lot of shared foundations and atmosphere the game had years to immerse us in. The action and setting are very much like the game, and I appreciate the humor that came with it in most of their jokes and attempts at humor. Yet the nostalgia factor is a big driving force of this installment, and will certainly be a big thumbs up for the target audience of gamers that this director seemed to be reaching out to greet. However, the movie is two games in one, and that gusto to bring the worlds together might have been a bit too big of a bite to handle for the time limit they granted. Racoon City's pace keeps things moving, but at the sacrifice of worthwhile plot and character usage that a full plate like this needs. It's horror element is worthy at times, but often is eroded by the writing, comedy, and lack of horror planning that the pace did not give time to achieve. Still... it's worth a view for the gaming audience and fans of the originals, but for the general fanbase of movies, you are most likely skipping this one that has the story a bit too all over the place.My scores are:Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
770,7,hnt_dnl,Better than most of the previous franchise,6/10,25 November 2021,"RESIDENT EVIL:WELCOME TO RACCOON CITY (2021) is a decent, neat throwback story that predates the Paul W. S. Anderson/Milla Jovovich franchise of films. Set in 1998, four years prior to the original Resident Evil movie that jumpstarted the films, Welcome to Raccoon City opts to keep things more grounded and simple and be an old-fashioned zombie story. No fancy tech, no macho super soldiers, no dumb and ridiculous stunts, and no slow motion nonsense. Raccoon City keeps it as real as possible. Yeah, there's still the fashion model actors in this, but surprisingly, I thought they all acted pretty well considering and I didn't think some of these actors had it in them. My biggest gripe of the movie is the questionable casting of Jill Valentine. Why on Earth would you not get someone who remotely resembled Sienna Guillory, especially since this character is one of the most beloved and important to the games and the films? This new actress, which I've seen in several things and is decent enough, distractingly looks nothing like Jill should look. It's kind of odd considering that all the other actors pretty much resemble the future versions of their characters like Wesker (spot on casting here) and the Redfields. But I digress.Raccoon City tells the story of Claire Redfield (Kaya Scodelario from The Maze Runner movies and Crawl), a young woman who returns to her hometown in order to warn her brother Chris Redfield (Robbie Amell of The Flash fame) of a pending viral outbreak about to hit the city courtesy of the diabolical Umbrella Corporation. The stage is already set as several people in the city are noticeably showing post-exposure signs and symptoms. Also, the streets are very empty due to Umbrella pulling funding from most of the businesses. Chris is a cop and part of the skeleton police crew which includes Jill Valentine (miscast Hannah John-Kamen), Albert Wesker (perfectly cast Tom Hopper), and Leon Kennedy (surprisingly effective Avon Jogia of Victorious fame). Their police chief is Irons (well played by Donal Logue of Gotham fame doing a slightly worse version of his Harvey Bullock impression). The always reliable Neal McDonough does his thing as the nefarious Birkin, the villain of the piece. Last but not least, the best character in this along with Wesker may be the scene-stealing Lisa Trevor (superbly played by Marina Mazepa), a genetically mutated experiment gone wrong.There are basically 2 converging plots going here (1) Claire scouring the city to find Chris and (2) The cops on a mission to find their missing team members. They all converge at a zombie-infested mansion with a secret passageway to an underground railroad that can lead them to safety. Sound familiar? Raccoon City focuses more on horror than action and has several first person POV scenes, like the barricade scene of the Chief trying to escape the city and that cool lighter scene of Chris being attacked by zombies in the mansion. The movie plays more like an ensemble than a star vehicle, which I don't think was the intent. This leads to another problem I had. Claire is bit too much of a plot device hero who just pops up randomly at the most convenient times to save the day. Her development is almost non-existent as it consists of nonstop flashbacks to when she was a child in the city's orphanage and in the ""present"" she literally only shows up in random scenes to either shoot or beat the crap out of zombies. I would say that characters like Wesker and Leon had more of an actual arc than her.As less of a fan I became of Milla Jovovich as the Resident Evil movies kept getting pumped out ad nauseum, she was pretty likable and relatable in the first film and had a real arc, way more so than Claire is in this one. Even with the large cast in the 2002 original film, the writers packed in a lot of development for Alice. It's just that she turned into a wannabe badass action hero as the franchise wore on. I still think the original Resident Evil movie is easily the best and most re-watchable of the original films. And much like that film, maybe even more so, Raccoon City keeps things grounded. I'd probably put this behind the original movie as 2nd best of the franchise. Of course that's not saying much.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
771,8,Movi3DO,No one needs,5/10,24 November 2021,"So when I got bored I used to go to YT and watch Chris Stuckmann's reviews of movies that I don't even watch or want to watch. I liked his reviews on the bad movies because he's pretty funny. And the Resident Evil movie series was one of them. I knew they ended, and somehow they wanted to reboot, a decision that almost no one wanted.As expected no one should want this movie. Simply put, it's just a mediocre zombie horror that is done better many times before. I'll give that the zombies look great and scary at times.Unfortunate, most of the horror came in the form of cheap jump scares that worked like two or three times. Very predictable buildup.The story was boring as heck. You barely knew anything about the lore and the characters. Pretty sure they depended on audiences playing the game or watching the movie series beforehand. I did none of that, so I felt a little bit lost at times. The characters were categorical in that u look at a character and you instantly knew that they would be the first to die.Overall, no one needed this. 5.5/10.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
772,9,jp_91,"A bad film, really bad.",4/10,27 November 2021,"A film that is more closely based on the video game, but the result is very bad, almost terrible. The story is set in 1998, however the costume design is pathetic, the costumes look totally like those used in the current 2020's, along with this error also comes the art direction, perhaps a little more worked but finally poorly done, the objects that appear throughout the film do include 90's models, but it is full of anachronisms such as the VCR (model from the early 80's), the cell phone (model from the early 2000's), etc. The makeup effects are dire, the zombies look like clowns, maybe the only good design in the whole movie is that of the character named Lisa Trevor. Digital special effects are pathetic, similar to those bad effects seen in films from the late 2000's and early 2010's. The performances are redeemable but not at all outstanding. The cinematographic direction is practically nil. The script is interesting but lousy carried during development, having a couple of interesting scenes, which are the only good things about the whole movie. ""Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City"" is an unfortunate production that should not have seen the light. I hope there is no sequel, as the middle credits of the film promised one.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
773,10,lareval,Don't bother...,1/10,25 November 2021,"It makes the Milla Jovivich films even better to me. This is an awfully executed, boringly disjointed, terribly miscast, soulless mix of two games and crushingly bad movie experience. On top of that: worst CGI I've seen in quite a bunch of years. The jump-scares are cheap and without the tension nor the build up like in the games and some of the previous movies. I don't know what is Kaya Scodelario doing here. The franchise (even being what it is), the actors and we as the audience deserve so much better than this.

775,12,statuskuo,Worst Than Expected,1/10,24 November 2021,"I wasn't expecting much and it just got worse than bad. It's an exercise in why you shouldn't follow to the letter of a video game. And for the fans who gripe about why...subject yourself to this awfulness. Paying so much fan service it could've been made by some geek at home. It looks cheap, feels cheap and is cheap.For those who played ""Resident Evil: Nemesis"" in the late 90's there will be many Easter eggs. That's all there is to this mess of a movie. It's bad. You know it's bad when the opening credits are in John Carpenter's credit sequence font and steals unapologetically for the corny split field diopter shots. It is that cheap. As are the effects. As is the acting. I feel this is the result of a foreign director attempting the English language. It's that terrible. Nothing makes sense and everyone in the movie is dumb beyond words. At some point it even felt like the actors gave up and just decided to really ham it up. Good for them.The most aggravating is the rookie cop who is so obnoxious and dumb you pray for zombies to kill him first. But this set up for him to have some arc...so we are saddled with this brain dead nitwit for a very long timeThe story is of the town of Raccoon City. Supposedly ground zero for the Umbrella Corp. To experiment. Here they use the orphanage to draw from..This is where we meet Claire and Chris Redfield. Again...part of the 90s game. Flash forward to 1998 and we're now with RPD. Or STARS unit. Which, again, draws from the game. Poor Donal Logue is the police chief and hammers out cliche dialogue like it gives him ulcers. His delivery is bad. And I guarantee you, he knows it. But we're again abused by it and the horrific dumb plot. There is none. And revelations of Umbrella and whatever it is a foregone conclusion but feels so tedious to drag an audience through. It's just plain boring and dumb. What was their purpose, if not to reboot a franchise. This would not be it.Oh God, it's bad.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

778,15,darkreignn,"If you're a fan of Resident Evil, you'll like this",9/10,25 November 2021,"The previous ""Resident Evil"" movies are big guilty pleasures of mine; they're not the most high quality films out there, but they're comfort movies - fun, easy going rides filled with attractive people and high-octane action. I just really enjoy them; and so, whenever it was revealed that they were rebooting this franchise without Milla Jovovich, I was slightly apprehensive. Milla is a staple of the franchise, and she is basically the reason why the other ""Resident Evil"" films are as entertaining as they are; she's beauty and brawn, and watching her fight zombies was always a good time. ""Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City"" ditches the action-movie feel, and doesn't recast Milla - however, both of those things are perhaps for the better because ""Welcome to Raccoon City"" was a surprisingly high-quality horror film.As soon as ""Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City"" begins, you'll realize that there's some true competence behind the camera; the direction and cinematography have some actual care and thought put into them, and it's clear that director Johannes Roberts has an eye for pleasing visuals. And not only pleasing, but also creepy - where the previous ""Resident Evil"" movies were anything but scary, here Johannes decides to take his time and amp up the tension through unsettling sights, sounds, and happenings. In other words, while the action doesn't begin immediately, the horror does - starting with a spooky scene in a children's orphanage, ""Welcome to Raccoon City"" differentiates itself from the previous movies by focusing on frightening its viewers first and delivering gory zombie action second. Of course, fright, much like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, so it is totally possible that you will not be scared by this movie - I wasn't. That said, I enjoyed and appreciated the slow-burn, creepy feel of the film.Based on the video games of the same name, you're most likely familiar with the many and memorable characters that inhabit the games. This movie introduces many of the same characters, albeit with a fresh take on them. Leon Kennedy is black-haired, fresh-faced, and bushy-tailed instead of blonde, chiseled, and badass. Wesker is an unassuming anti-hero (arguably) instead of a full-on villain. It's little choices like these that have the potential to anger hardcore fans of the games, but I quite enjoyed the new direction the film took with these characters. All of the characters get ample time to shine, as well as to fight.That wasn't the smoothest transition in the world, but I did want to take time to talk about this film's action. While not as action heavy as the previous movies, there is enough gore here to satisfy. Foregoing the martial arts style of combat previously employed by Milla and crew, here you have gun-on-zombie violence. Sure, it's not the most creative thing in the world, but the back to basics mentality of the action is fun enough to watch, especially with Johannes distinct visual flare.Look, there really isn't much to say here other than I had a blast with this movie. If you're not a fan of the games or the previous movies in the ""Resident Evil"" series, you're probably not going to like this. If you are? You'll probably like this. I, for one, had a lot of fun with this, and am fully open to a sequel.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
779,16,tresm87,Seems like a resident evil made for Netflix reboot thrown together with enticing enough visuals but no story.,5/10,24 November 2021,"People often hate on Paul W. S. Anderson Resident Evil films but this reboot makes the first 3 of his RE films look way better. This film just seemed so unnecessary at its announcement and now after watching it seems that even the director/writer believed that too. The story tries to follow the plot of the original video game at first and continues to do so decently until the end but tapers off somewhat in the end. Visually it's highly entertaining and possesses some moments that do have commendable aspects, but story and acting just doesn't help it overall. There are times of cgi that come off laughable and so sloppy, it makes you want the early to mid 2000s practical effects utilized way more in WS anderson RE films. The film has some fan service that is sure to please the die hards but overall just seems forced and rushed.

782,19,influxtwo,The Video Games do it so much better.,5/10,28 November 2021,"As a big Resident Evil fan, I found this movie a bit underwhelming. The ambient soundscore and the game-accurate set design all worked wonderfully. But the treasures kind of stopped there. The writing was nearly atrocious. The sets were not utilized enough. How hard is it to just do a story that's already been done? In pixels, no less. The film was so rushed. The zombies looked cheesy and stale in most scenes except for a couple of the earlier scenes that were more successful. I wish they had stuck closer to the games. This wasn't super survival horror driven. It was mostly awkward ham-fisted clunky dialogue. And brief clumsy action scenes. I also found the movie to grow boring the longer it went on. This really could have aired on TV. Overall I would still take this kind of fan fiction over the Milla/Anderson movies any day. Just thought this was kind of a turkey. Can't really hate on it more than that. It was alright, but the games do it so much better. The story was underutilized, rushed, all over the place. Feels too americanized for a Japanese survival horror series. I honestly couldn't take this film very seriously. It was more of a bite-sized fan fiction. Resident Evil Lite. I liked it more than the Milla universe any day though. The games are better any day but I still enjoyed about a good 60-70% of this.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
783,20,bigbadbassface,So much potential,6/10,24 November 2021,"They really tried to cram a lot into this movie but it just never clicked. The movie had strong bones but suffered from weak writing and plot. The Redfields and Wesker were cast perfectly but Jill Valentine and Leon were horribly miscast. I don't know if it was because of Hollywood making everything diverse but not only did they not look like the characters they didn't sound or make decisions like them. Man I had high hopes but it just fell short.

785,22,lawrencelawrence86,Bit of a forehead slapper.,2/10,27 November 2021,"Again a disappointing film, it suffers from not the best acting, not the best sets, lighting was off, the live action zombies were a bit drab and the cgi was very cgi, possibly because of the lighting. Do appreciate the effort to make it close to the game but a film is a very different beast, I don't think I have ever felt fear from a film like I have a game so keeping it cinematographically similar won't lead to scares without investment for the character from the viewer.

786,23,bbevis-47954,Critics,6/10,24 November 2021,"A decent Resident Evil movie with some gore, cheap jump scares and a lot of fan-service. Not everything clicks and it's incredibly easy to be overly critical of this movie but in my opinion it was certainly a lot better than the trash that was Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. I grabbed some popcorn, candy and a coke with my expectations firmly in check and I had a decent overall time. I'm a big fan of schlocky B-movies and it's nice to see something in theatres that isn't related to superheroes or overly-serious dramas. What I didn't like the most though was how Leon was portrayed but I guess that's because I got done playing RE4 on the oculus and I'm used to that representation of him.After watching Resident Evil: Welcome to Racoon City I read a lot of the reviews on IMDB and the only reviews being liked are from people who bombed the film. Are people really that desperate to hate on a movie they haven't seen? What are your expectations going into a Resident Evil movie if you have seen it?

The movie does also have some impressive sets, sound design, and suspenseful, atmospheric lighting. Aside from these things, this is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen.Johannes Roberts is a writer/director who has yet to make a film that fulfils any of the basic requirements of storytelling: actual characters with real needs and desires, a plot that is focused on what matters and follows consistent rules, visual effects that work within the allotted budget and are convincing...these things are merely options for this man, and he has chosen yet again to forego them.My girl Kaya deserves better than this....

788,25,MackMonMay87,Not So Welcome,5/10,28 November 2021,"The best way to experience the storyline and atmosphere of Resident Evil is in the games, and this reboot proved that.Releasing it in the middle of the week on Thanksgiving with no other competition from other major studio releases shows the level of confidence they had in this. Screen Gems still has the rights to make live action RE films, and now that Milla Jovovich and the ""Alice""-verse storyline is wrapped up, it's very clear they wanted to make a movie to keep the rights, turn a bit of a profit, and that's about it.The movie tries merging the storylines of the 1st and 2nd games, but doesn't really do justice to the immersive environments of either. Some of the sets do look like they tried to be faithful to the games, but it's clear that the budget wasn't there to make the mansion ominous, huge, trap-filled and spooky, or the police station filled with secret rooms and an extensive underground lab like the games. Welcome to Raccoon City gives you hints and references towards the style of the games, with winks and nods, but not much substance as a movie itself.It's nice to see some commitment to the costumes, the creature designs, the character dynamics, and like I mentioned, some of the sets, but this movie has such a small-scale, contained, made-for-Netflix vibe to it. If this had been a fan film made by talented Resident Evil fanatics that was released on Youtube, this would've been amazing. But since it's supposed to be an actual widely released movie, it just falls short.I highly recommend the 2019 remakes of Resident Evil 2&3. The games are simply the best way to experience this world, and the visuals, characters, even acting are all better in the games. The threats, scares, and atmosphere is more effective when you're playing it as well. If you're not a Resident Evil die-hard, you can skip this welcome.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

Leon looks so much better in RE2 Remake game with his short blonde hair and Nick Apostolides is a better Leon cause he did the voice and mocap of Leon in the Remake game and really should of been Nick in this movie and not Avan Jogia. Nick has the best cosplay as Leon including the wig, if Avan Jogia was waering Leon's wig in this movie i would Love Leon in this but no the writers had to mess him up and i truly think they made Leon act stupid in this.They even screwed up Jill's character that is not even her either with the long curly hair, but they did do a good job on Chris he looks better then Leon and Jill and he looks like Chris in RE1 Remake game. Claire looks okay to me and the only thing that made her character different is her hair was in a ponytail in the RE2 Remake and i don't care about the other characters.

I was actually impressed with it, but I did set the bar low. The technical aspects of the film (cinematography, script, acting, etc) were on par with typical ""B"" movies. The actors did a good job with what they had, though I do question a couple of the casting choices. Wesker and Valentine did not look or properly represent the Wesker and Valentine from the video game. Wesker was more of a college frat bruh than a serious antagonist against the heros. The story started a little slow, and almost all of the flashbacks could have been avoided, leaving more time for character development. But, as is, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was an enjoyable popcorn flick.

Scares weren't effective like the games. They spent way to much time making it look good and not enough time on story or action. I appreciate the time they took making it look just like the game but I kept waiting to get immersed in the story or action but I just didn't.Overall nice effort and if you were going for visuals you'll be happy. But don't go for scares or action. Not much to be had here. And don't think I'm trying to be a hater. I was looking forward to this. My car is an umbrella corporation vehicle so resident evil has a special place in my heart. And even tho I do love the original movies flawed as they may be they were a lot better than this.I'm looking forward to see what they do next time around if we get another. Hopefully this will just be one of those origin stories that tend to be a little slower than the rest of the series.

I understand the trouble in adapting the dozens of games into a cohesive story line that's also going to work in a movie. There's a lot of faithful story telling here as well as deviating a lot and taking creative liberties which I'm fine with. My quick rundown, all the monsters looked fantastic especially Birkin's transformation exception being Lisa Trevor looked kinda meh and her story change was a little meh. All the characters are way more interconnected compared to the games which was nicely done. The only and biggest problem the movie has is that it expects most people to already know and understand everything that's going on and as a result lots of details that make up the overall plot can be vague and confusing to someone whose never played the games. The action scenes were well done. Leon is my favorite character so I was disappointed he doesn't get many action scenes and they changed him into a more slacker type character which I'm fine with because he's usually in the spotlight in the CG movies so it was nice seeing that go to Chris and Claire for once but if they just split it into two movies I feel like they wouldn't have had this problem.

Why?,3/10,24 November 2021,"Whos bright idea was it to combine BOTH 1st game and 2nd game into 1 movie? There is so much content packed into the first 2 games, even attempting to pack all that into 1 movie is an INSANELY difficult task. So why would they put this SUPER HARD super unnecessary burden on themselves? Who knows? To even remotely pull something like that off, you have to be an INSANELY talented writer and director, like Quinten Tarantino level of writing skills. But nope, we got ""Johannes Roberts,"" never heard of him? Neither have I, I looked him up just for this movie. His most notable movie is ""47 Meters Down,"" a horrible B-movie shark movie, and now he did this movie, and surprise surprise, this movie has HORRIBLE pacing and sucks. It would make more sense to combine 2nd and 3rd games because they both take place on the same day.Every actor in this movie is flat, not 1 memorable performance in the whole movie. Claire is extremely basic, pretty much stoic the entire movie, and the few scenes that required her to somewhat act, she failed. Chris looks most like Chris from the games, but he's pretty basic as well. The guy who plays Birkin is always in HORRIBLE movies, I should've known this sucked beforehand because he's in it. From now it, I'm never paying for another movie if that guy is in it. He's just a horrible sign.Leon is straight-up insulting! I don't even care they changed his race, because they made him a straight-up SUPER idiot with no redeeming qualities. I understand it's his first day of being a cop, but no one is this stupid. You wouldn't even be able to be hired as a cop in the first place if you are this dumb and this big of a weenie. The actual game had a way more realistic approach what a first-day cop would be like, obviously you'd be nervous and that's okay, but no normal person would be this over-the-top dumb and lame like movie Leon. What did the writer have against Leon? It's like they constantly went out of their way to make Leon lame as possible. I guess Leon is their lame attempt at a comic relief character, but even then, there's better ways to do comedy at the expense of a character. Besides, the so called ""comedy"" wasn't even funny anyway. Leon does get his tiny moment of redemption at the end, but it's so small and underwhelming, plus the character development and pacing is so awful, that it feels like it comes outta nowhere.Last but not least, this movie looks EXTREMELY cheap. Very cheap-looking production and this has some of the worst CGI I've seen in years. Why is this in theatres only?It's very hard to come up with positives in this movie, but the only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is some of the scares were decent and reminiscent of the games, and some set designs were cool and loyal to the games. There's also a lot of cool references and easter eggs to the games, but you can't solely rely on that to carry a movie. I'm not a 12, I need more than that. I need good writing, good pacing, actual character development, good action, etc. First. You know, super common sense stuff.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

I've never seen such awful Visual Effects since Mortal Kombat Annihilation and that was 20 years ago. There was literally no plot after 20 minutes. It's just go to one location and the next. The references to the first 2 Remakes were refreshing, but they completely relied on them the whole movie. Don't even get me started on the actors. None of them are anything like their Video Game CounterParts. Not even Chris. The guy who played Wesker should have played Chris. Jill is completely underused and the change to Claire's story is dull and boring. This was another awful Video Game Adaptation. This film makes me appreciate The 2002 version more. That one actually had a plot. Sony please give this franchise to New Line Cinema Or Blumhouse. Stop trying to make Resident Evil into a movie you've failed too many times.

The VFX for this movie is awful I've never seen such bad CGI since Mortal Kombat Annihilation back in 97. While the references to the first 2 games were refreshing, but the problem was is that the writers were relying on the references to tell the story. The plot is almost none existent, it's just go to one location to the next location. Also the actors do a horrible job playing these iconic video game characters. Almost all of them act like nothing compared to their Video Game CounterParts. The only one that does a decent job is the actor for chris. Everyone else did not do a good job at all.

The filmmakers tried bless their hearts. Do I agree with all the changes? No, having RC a small town is odd, especially with the huge police station/museum. A long tunnel from the mansion to under the city they run down? Like... what? Lol. But it's just that, it's just fun. This film isn't trying to rewrite the games, the games are the ultimate being.

They actually made a resident evil horror movie this time. Not an action movie where the characters are more like super heroes. Loved it! Had a lot of references to the video game. This is what I wished the Mila Jovavich movies were, instead of the over the top trash that felt like a 12 year old wrote it.

They tried to do so much by condensing both the first two games in a single film. The humor is wack. The characters are jokes for the most part, especially Leon! I think it would've been better had they chose to focus on just a single game instead of two. The production design is similar to the games which is cool, but it's also sort of off-putting. I appreciate the attempt at giving us fans a love letter to the games, but it's just not good. All in all, don't go into this film expecting it to be like the first two games, maybe then you won't be disappointed like me.

814,51,searcherer,"At times, it felt like I was watching an after-midnight B-movie",4/10,27 November 2021,"Insanely wasted potential. This movie lacks refinement, feel, and perspective. It also fails on the technical front, where it tries to complement silly human acting with visuals and other effects, with output that's subpar even when judged according to 80s movie standards. The choice of actors for portraying probably the most two important characters of the whole Resident Evil universe is, and not that there is anything wrong with the actors themselves, miserable, where neither Jill nor Leon's characters are anything near the distinctive and hugely successful in-game versions. I was simply disappointed with this movie, especially so seeing as how one trailer followed after the other, building anticipation in one loyal fan yet to be eventually punched in the face with a laughable attempt at what's probably one of the most distinguished and exciting thriller/horror adventures out there.

While the pacing is uneven, the characters are too numerous for meaningful development, and few dangers exist for more than 1-2 scenes, it does manage to come together into a watchable movie.Individual scenes are excellent, and mostly well directed, however it feels more like 2 episodes of a good TV series stitched together into one movie than it does a cohesive story on it's own. The actors manage generally strong takes on each individual character, while also sometimes toying with franchise fan's expectations, though none really get the time they need to shine.It's also worth noting that, while the movie looks genuinely great much of the time, atmospheric darkness and rain playing well on-camera, there are a handfull of CGI creatures that look dated at best.All in all, it's a watchable movie, though it might play best from the comfort of your own home.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

The games actually have an incredibly well done story so it was nice that they tried to make a nod to them instead of whatever the Mila Jovovich movies were (nothing against her, I like her as an actor but those movies sucked!).Its obvious this wasnt given a huge budget so they had to be picky with the story because the CGI wasnt great and there wasnt much time showing the destruction and zombies running rampant in the streets of Racoon City but ultimately I had a lot of fun as a fan of the series.

825,62,nizarsalim,Resident Evil 1+2+3 within 107 minutes???!!! It won't Work Properly,7/10,27 November 2021,"Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City is a good movie, but at the same time, it is not an excellent one. When it comes to the positive sides, the positive sides in this movie are the performances (especially the actor who plays Leon), the creepy, tense, and frightening atmosphere, the soundtrack, the effects (whether the visual or the sound), and focusing on horror more than the previous franchise starring Milla Jovovich, which focused on action more. Also, even if this is a movie, not a game, it indirectly refers to the puzzles which are in the games.But what I criticize in this movie is (1) trying to combine the first game of Resident Evil, Resident Evil 2, and Resident Evil 3 which are nearly seven hours long each into one movie which is only 107 minutes long, (2) changing many aspects and events in the original games (like the fact that leon didn't meet Ada in the police department, he didn't meet her at all even), and (3) the absence of many elements that where originally in the original games. For example, the Tyrant from R E is not there, Mr. X from R E 2 is not there, the Nemesis from R E 3 is also not there. If the movie was longer than 107 minutes (150 minutes, for instance) it would have been a lot better because at least one of these bosses could have been added, although, just as a note, some of the bosses (the giant snake and the shark) in R E were indirectly mentioned in the movie.It would have been even better and better if only the first game in Resident Evil was adapted and focused on in this movie.Also, the person who is watching the movie can feel that the direction and the plot are, we can say, confusing and dispersed because some parts of the movie focus on the Spencer Mansion, and some other parts focus on the Raccoon City Police Department and the Raccoon City Orphanage, except for the final part which unites all these parts together.But despite the fact that Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City has these flaws, this does not make it an unenjoyable movie. On the contrary, I enjoyed it so much, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. I give it 7 out of 10.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
826,63,muchblunt-534-683983,Movie Based in '98 with CGI from '98,6/10,24 November 2021,"The movie was one giant fan service, while that might sound like the best thing ever, it only caused the film to be cluttered and messy. The story was all over the place and hard to follow, though to be honest there wasn't much of coherent story to begin with. The worst part was the CGI, not sure if they didn't have the money or what but the tracking was off on a good amount of the CGI. It was just bad and took me out of the movie every time it popped up. I've seen movies from actual 1998 that had better CGI. The practical effects were good however, though I'm not overly sure if it's good by comparison or actually good. The acting wasn't too bad but I think the casting was off, and some of the characters' personalities weren't exactly game accurate. All together it was a fun action packed movie that lacked a soul, that's why I didn't give it a horrendous rating, it's still enjoyable. 'A' for effort.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
827,64,TheActionBuff,"If you are a RE video game fan, do not watch!",4/10,27 November 2021,"This movie had a similar budget to the original movie, but it lacked in every aspect (horror,suspense,story,location) in comparison. The actors didn't seem to be given much to work with, which left the story to be pretty stale. The first 40 minutes of the movie is good, but it begins to fizzle when the stories begin blending weirdly together. If you haven't played resident evil and you enjoy horror movies, maybe give this a try. The budgets nowdays don't spread as far when making a movie and it shows. 32 million in 2002 goes a lot further than 40 million in 2021.

Losing the game fans due to excessive fan service and the common audience who will have no idea what the fan service parts even mean. Another disservice to the game fans is that most characters don't act or even look like their in game counterparts.Say what you want about Paul W. S Anderson and his wife insert but at least he knew how to cast characters to where they at least looked like how they did in the game.Sienna Guillroy as Jill Valentine in Apocalypse is still 10/10.

Everyone complains about the story, character development and CGI.Doesn't anyone but me miss Yawn, Neptune, the giant corocdile, the Web Spinners and the Hunter?!That's my one big criticism that turns 8 stars into 4 for me.My Resident Evil experience as a child was that every time I opened a door I was afraid of what was lurking behind it.I don't know how Roberts played the game, but he didn't seem to care about snakes and other BOWs.The snake Yawn would have fitted so grandly into the atmosphere.I could see the attention to detail, but still only half was told here and that's not because of the short playtime of the FIlm, but that more emphasis was put on other things.Lisa Trevor fits well, but for me she has no meaning at all and is no substitute for all the missing BOWs.Leon S. Kennedy is not important to me and I'm even glad that I didn't have to endure his boy band hairstyle from the games in the film.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

Anderson's so called ""Resident Evil"" movies, we finally get a film that takes the best horror elements from the games along with actually characters from the games. Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, blends elements from the first two games into one thrill ride of a film. The horror is finally seen through the eyes of Johannes Roberts who stays true to his word in making his RE film an actual horror film. Yes, it has cheesy dialogue, so did the games. Yes the CGI is noticeable at time but with his limited budget he delivers. The studio needs to green light a sequel so that we can see what else is in store for the fabled Redfields.Oh and yes we get the Jill Sandwich line.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

845,82,blinkar,Gamers vs non-gamers,7/10,28 November 2021,"Let me be brief. I went in with a less than optimistic opinion and came out pleasantly surprised.For those familiar with the original franchise, it was ester eggs galore (I'll just say: snake, shark, hunk, Veronica). They did you justice in attempting to blend in two games/storylines in a manner that stayed true to the originals. They had to make a few tweaks where it pays off in some aspects and not so much in others. Overall, if you know the games, you know that this is probably one of the most accurate depictions thus far. Including the cheesiness of it. It is clear that they were on a budget with some cgi but it still works.Although if there's a sequel I hope they do Leon some justice. Oh and a prequel wouldn't be a bad idea to further explain the lore.For those not familiar, it will play as a cheesy B movie with a few good scares.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

But the easter eggs throughout the film are a fans wet dream. I still dont understand Hollywood's desire to rewrite stories though and make them different. Makes no sense to me. You can still modernize the same story. The film itself is a fun ride though. I was entertained throughout the whole thing which was all that mattered. Only thing I wouldve done differently is make this a trilogy instead of cramming two games in one.

847,84,rhm-64412,Mediocre at best,6/10,26 November 2021,"There's some good stuff here if you are willing to overlook the butchering of lore and characters (SPOILERS AHEAD). For example Chief Irons is coward (pretty much his only bad trait) in this, funny but absolutely nothing like his character. I will go through ""some"" lore differences real quick and the characters:Chris Redfield: He doesn't really act like Chris, he doesn't believe Claire at all which later prompts William Birkin to call him dumb and her smart. He also is very childish having a back and forth shhhh with Claire, he not Wesker in this leads the unnamed Team (Team Bravo seems only to consist of Marini and Dewey here with Richard with the ""Alpha"" team we know minus Barry). He has some good moments but runs and tries to take on William Birkin but instead gets saved by Claire in mere seconds (Claire saving people tends to be a running theme). Here instead of being born and raised in New York, and taking care of Claire like in the books he with Claire was born and raised in Racoon City and after their parents died lived at the Orphanage there headed by William Birkin. Later Claire escapes and Chris basically gets raised and put to school and Airforce by none other than Birkin and Umbrella, a stark change. He also has a thing for Jill in this which in the games is never shown beyond being a partner.Claire Redfield: Here she meets Lisa at the Orphanage briefly and then escapes it leaving Chris behind for 5 yrs, this means that Claire has not in this learned her skills from Chris but just mysteriously happens to have learned on her own to the point she knows more than new but actually professionally trained rookie transfer Leon about weapons. She seems to act older than Chris and much smarter in this. Despite barely knowing or seeing Lisa somehow they formed a bond by Claire just seeing her and asking her name just to read it off the arm band. She's also to nonchalant in this. For example when the Re2 trucker hits what they think is a person (a zombie who just disappears for the rest of the movie) she just gets out says lets wrap up the body and have my police officer brother help. After the body disappears there's just a brief nonchalant comments about it. This seems very contrary to her Re2 motherly persona. Her character is fine other than this except when she basically is in to much in the forefront. Instead of looking for Chris due to losing contact with him after the Spencer Mansion incident and thus looking for him, she just disappeared after escaping the Orphanage for 5 yrs and decides to visit him to show him info for some reason Ben Bertolucci decides to give to her. In which Chris doesn't believe her and basically gives her money, tells her he is going to work, not to mess his bike up and get out. Weird.Leon S. Kennedy: Worst character in this movie, he's basically a bumbling bafoon, joke of a character. His backstory is completely rewritten almost entirely. He's not actually a brand new rookie recruit, he's actually a new ""transfer"" who accidentally shot his partner in the butt somehow in his previous precint. His dad is also a hot shot cop. This seems to be why he is a cop instead of the incidents of the murders in the Arklay Mountain's giving him motivation due to a strong sense of Justice to join the force. Unlike this movie Leon was seen as an intelligent and gifted rookie. His training officers being none other than Rita and Kevin Ryman from Resident Evil Outbreak. Rita who assisted Marvin to help save the people of the RPD and Kevin being a main character and exceptional Marksman who took a pivotal role in the events on the frontlines. Leon in this movie gets saved multiple times and doesn't really do anything until the very end via one rocket Launcher. Claire has to save and carry him twice, 3 if you count her being the only one shooting zombies in the running with Chief Irons scene (as well as Lisa save them). Claire also has to help him learn how to use the shotgun, and he gets tricked and basically blackmailed easily by a jailed Ben Bertolucci.Wesker: Wesker doesn't look anything like his counterpart, never gets his glasses, doesn't lead Team Alpha, plays around with the others like a typical team member. Has not worked for Umbrella and though contacted by a rich group to take information in the Spencer Mansion for a high price doesn't know that group either. He also doesn't seem to have any connections whatseover with the Wesker experiments nor does he even know William Birkin. He is a cool character but like the other's carries their characters title in name only. After betraying his group by leaving them behind to get the virus from Birkin, he shoots Birkin (who goes down and takes the virus), Annette (nothing like her counterpart in looks, personality or even job, same with Sherry except personality as her's is barely shown) takes the gun points it at Wesker who shoots her through the head dead, after which he for some reason kinda regrets what he did but not with Birkin which made no sense to me. Sherry then picks up the gun, points it at him, he points at her and Jill shoots him and basically kills him. He basically jokes before he dies and basically says he regrets doing this and that he wouldn't have shot the little girl, making him not so bad of a guy, he just wanted money to get out of the Racoon City Hell Hole, Birkin being evil anyway. Completed a different character altogether.Jill Valentine: Honestly not much to say here, she doesn't look anything like Jill and she really doesn't have much of a personality. She's just shown being incredible in marksmanship, has a thing for Wesker stated (which is completely contrary to her game character btw) and pretty much bland besides that. She does go a tad overboard in things but besides that not much more to say.Another thing I want to mention is how weird everything here is, especially the Police station as there are no officers shown except Alpha Team (plus Richard who is on this team), Irons and Leon. When Irons runs away he makes Leon Chief briefly, prior to that in the Alpha Team talk to find Bravo, Leon is there by misunderstanding and gets kicked out by Irons who asked who will get the phones. Like what?! We know the RPD was brimming as shown in Resident Evil Outbreak and some cops still zombies in Re2 and Re3 and so forth. Also the designs of the places are changed in some ways, for example the Orphanage and Spencer Mansion are connected by a secret passage (an elevator) which is opened by it looks like the shaped keys from Re2 (strange considering those were RPD keys, you would think it would be armor keys from Re1), the Mansion has the train from NEST also from Re2. So they seem to connect everything thus changing the designs so contra what people are saying aren't as faithful as you might have come to believe.Lisa doesn't really get any backstory at all contrary to what the creators suggested. She also is friends with Claire (whom she never met in the games) so is completely different from her game persona, actually helping her and Leon to get into Spencer via the keys and protecting them from a Licker. Character deaths were changed, Marini (no lines) was eaten by the first Zombie in the Mansion shown not Kenneth who is never mentioned. Richard was eaten by a hoard of Zombies, Brad's story was ripped partly from Kevin Dooley's who doesn't exist in this (meaning Brad's stuff from Re3 is scrapped completely) and the Helicopter crash from Re2 (caused by a cop getting eaten and accidentally firing at the police pilot who came to get him). No mention or hint of Barry or Rebecca at all. No Jill outfit or hat. Umbrella locks down the City and Chief Irons doesn't make this seem abnormal (he doesn't work for Umbrella or have any connections, he also doesn't do any very evil things in this or have any connections to the Orphanage besides running there, he dies by a licker with Leon and Claire trying to escape. Sherry barely talks and actually spends more time with Chris and Jill then Claire and Leon. Overall it was meh, as long as you don't take it seriously have expectations it would be faithful it can pass the time I guess.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

It grabs you by the collar from the beginning and does not let go (fast pace). Have to understand the game setting to appreciate the production, but the production was good. Acting was fine, i understand the critiques of the Leon character but i am not convinced the script writers are not fooling us, we will find out in the next film. Two hints convinced me he was not who was claiming to be (practical police rookie that landed there to get away from an embarrassing situation). The way he handled a pistol reload in the jail and the way he handled that rocket launcher might indicate he is more than he appears. I also enjoyed the Mila initial Resident Evil film and the 2nd and 3rd and 4th films, but they were of a different tone, they were more fun to watch, whereas Welcome to Racoon is actually terrifying (an actual horror movie). I cannot count how many times i jumped. The film scoring was good and the sound editing was loud, constantly had your attention. Bravo to this first installment of the reboot, i really enjoyed it.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

851,88,Movies_Games_Reviews,I'm huge Resident Evil fan and i didn't like this movie at all,1/10,27 November 2021,"I never really hated ""Resident Evil"" (2002), it was decent zombie-horror with Resident Evil elements. It didn't try to copy-paste any RE game, but at least it was professionally made by 2002 standards.Now, people who say that this new movie is more ""accurate"" to games, i have to disagree. They had one job and that was getting Leon right and they failed completely. Leon is one of the most important characters in Resident Evil. Leon is main character/one of them in two most popular RE Games, 2 and 4. RE7 sold more for different reasons, nobody cared who is RE7's main character. You can't make Leon look like Carlos and make him comic relief. You just can't.For conclusion, i don't even understand where this budget went, because apparently it's budget was 25 million. I have seen better zombie movies done with less. ""The Crazies"" (2010) budget was 20 million. Sadly this new RE movie doesn't even feel like fan-film, because real Re fan would never disrespect RE characters like that.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

It was like reliving my younger years out of the video game, I knew what was going to happen before it happened. But the suspense still was there. There's times where it was ehh like it dragged alittle but, the ending felt cut short, but Atleast there was a ending credit scene for what's to come next. Hope to see this Franchise rise.!

854,91,IsraelZavala767,Resident Evil: The Fan Edit,6/10,24 November 2021,"For starters I'm a huge fan of both the Video Game franchise and the Paul Anderson film series. With that being said this actually made me appreciate Resident Evil (2002) so much more.I went into this movie really wanting it to be everything i hoped but honestly it suffers in a lot of glaring areas. For starters we get a mix of story elements from RE1 and RE2 (RE: Nemeses is completely ignored FYI and the way the film ends there's no possibility of us ever seeing Jill go head to head with Nemeses in future installments).The original Resident Evil game had such a great storyline revolving around the Spencer Mansion and the underground lab and having S. T. A. R. S. Trying to piece together how the outbreak happened, in this film we get NONE OF THAT. The mansion is there but our characters find out nothing about the initial outbreak in the mansion other then a couple quick easy to miss details that are never expanded on whatsoever.The films opening starts off right off the bat the lower budget is felt, Racoon city is a smaller town (not a bustling big city like the games or RE: Apocalypse) No more then 10 Zombies are seen at a time on screen. The Cerberus VFXs are atrocious they look very amateur. The actors are actually pretty solid with the exception of the actress tasked with playing the Iconic character Jill Valentine. I like the actress just not for this role at all she feels miscast.Overall the film rushes through a lot of potentially good moments the most solid parts of the film are the mansion scenes and Lisa Trevor although even she becomes a throw away plot point when you realize she is gone after Racoon city is blown up.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City
855,92,hlopez90,So much better than the trailer,10/10,27 November 2021,"I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed this one. The sets were great and the actors were all decent. It was surprisingly atmospheric and creepy. The special effects in some parts could've used some touching up... the film definitely tried to incorporate more of the game into the movie adaptation. Yeah, it had it's pretty cheesy moments but it was overall quite entertaining. I give it a solid 7.5-8 but voting as a 10 because I know some rabid fans will give it unnecessary hate.

856,93,smclean-30427,A Resident Evil movie done right!,8/10,24 November 2021,"This reboot is such an improvement over other ""Resident Evil"" movies which were only really resident evil in name only. The cinematography and pacing actually felt like a horror movie. Fans of the game will get a kick out of familiar locations. I was nervous about combining the first two games but thought the adaptation was really well done and thoughtful to the story. I hope the follow up gets into Code Veronica. There's such potential for a cinematic entry there!

It's a bit of a slow-burn horror movie, but has lots of scenery and Easter eggs the fans of the games will love. I think the writers managed to find a cohesive timeline that introduced apl major characters and built a manageable plot that provides back story, action, and horror.As much as I enjoyed it, there was something missing that held it back from being 10/10 that I can't quite put my finger on...Overall, I was very entertained and I hope they continue the series!

858,95,KaiseeB,Being a faithful adaptation doesn't make it good,2/10,24 November 2021,"I'm honestly confused as to who this movie was made for. It's a somewhat faithful adaptation, sure (though it does get incredibly sloppy in the second half), but it lacks any of the fun or action the original games offered. They tried to cram both of the first twogames into one movie, and the end result has incredibly weird pacing. It's like the first half is slow without giving us much and the second half is an insanely rushed mess. The CGI is laughable. And what did they do to Jill? She's nothing like her video game counterpart.If you aren't a fan of the games and just want to watch a zombie action movie, then I would honestly say you are still better off with the W. S. Anderson version. At least that has some ounce of personality.My final thoughts: just play the video games. This movie did not need to exist.

So I had the bar set high for this reboot and unfortunately it just didn't meet expectations.They do a great job of using the source material from the video game but the acting wasn't that great, the pacing was bad, and there just wasn't enough action.

861,98,husnanchaudhry,By far the worst movie I have ever seen,1/10,27 November 2021,"This movie isn't for true fans. Anyone who enjoys this is probably not a fan fan, but I could be wrong. This takes the back story of some of the best video game characters ever made and alters them. Leon is bubbling idiot. Chris and Claire aren't close. Jill is in love with Wesker. What the hell? Raccoon City contains only poor people with empty streets? No nuke? Character motivations are different from those of the video games. This movie should never had been greenlit. There should be no sequel. This movie is RE 1, 2, 3, and a little of Code Veronica in one. I am beyond shocked as to how out of touch, the studio, the director, the writers, and entire crew are from the source material. The original RE movies did something completely different - so it never tried to be faithful to the games. Completely new angle - so some of those movies a small pass. But this, this is just a slap in the face of any true Resident Evil fan. To those who accept this, I really don't know what to say.",Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City

863,0,boblipton,A Princess-Free Disney Cartoon Feature,6/10,27 November 2021,"This feature had its songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also is one of the writers credited with the book. In a hidden valley in Colombia is a prosperous town with a magical family. They live in a magical house, and the grandmother's descendants all have some fantastic ability, like being infinitely strong, or causing immense amounts of flowers to appear out of nowhere. All except Mirabel, who says she's fine with it, and so does everyone else. Still, everyone is terrified that the magic is fading. Mirabel has visions in which she sees the house cracking into dust, and goes on a quest to find her missing uncle Bruno (voiced by John Leguizamo doing an Al Pacino imitation). It's an elaborate and novel mythical thesis, which means the story bogs down a bit until it's all been explained, usually in song. This is probably why I thought the songs improved as the movie continued, with one or two very good ones, particularly ""The Miracle is You.""The other issue I had with this movie is the elaborate choreography. In an industry in which green screen, CGI and wire-fu allow real actors to engage in movement that looks cartoonish, what are actual cartoons, even CGI ones supposed to do. The choreography in this one sometimes seems impossible to me, often performed with a flexibility and weightlessness that removes the beauty and achievement from the greatest dancers. It makes me sad that this new, impossible standard is one that people will grow up to expect.Those cavils from an old grouch aside, this Disney celebrates the magic in ordinary people, has an affirming moral at its end, and shows a revival of the candy box back ground work that Disney led the cartoon factories in during its heyday. It certainly gets its job done.",Encanto
864,1,digitalbeachbum,Not a movie I liked,1/10,26 November 2021,"I think part of the problem was the therater I went to see this movie in, had a problem with the sound being too loud. It was hurting my ears. I had to plug them each time a song happened.I also didn't like the formula. It was a typical Disney movie with Pixar influences. Animated, large eyes of characters, typical predictable script, simple and immature songs. A typical ending.I did enjoy a few individual scenes, but it wasn't worth the $15 for the viewing. I ended up being able to predict the ending within the first fifteen minutes.I dislike formulaic movies and this one fits that exactly. It is a cookie cutter movie. Cheap, unworthy and not a movie I want to ever watch again.

865,2,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Encanto does not match Disney's last classic 'Raya And The Last Dragon', but it keeps them on a roll",6/10,24 November 2021,"Encanto (2021) :
Movie Review -Walt Disney Animation Studios seems to be having a good run this year. Their previous outing this year 'Raya And The Last Dragon' was a fabulous standalone (All-alone Disney Production) animated film. It was probably their first ever solo production (outside Pixar mostly) which recieved high critical acclaim since Cult Classic 'The Lion King'. Now, the same production has brought another animated flick on the occasion of Thanksgivings, and the end result is nothing bad but a perfect treat for families. Encanto may not surpass Raya And The Last Dragon-visually and emotionally, but it has some brilliant visually appealing scenes of its own and plenty of entertaining musical numbers to keep audience hooked for the entire runtime, with of course conditions applied. One can say that watching Encanto on Thanksgiving weekend with your family would give you a better experience than any other time.Encanto is set in a whole new fictional world, just like a fantasy park. Better say a Disney Park. In the film, we see a family called the Madrigals who live in an enchanted town in the mountains of Colombia. Every child but one in their magical house has been granted a unique ability such as strength or healing powers. Mirabel, the only ordinary Madrigal, discovers that the ancient magic is under threat and then she goes on to find hidden, unknown visions to make things right. Whatever is the runtime of Enchanto, it doesn't really matter because Jared Bush and Charise Castro Smith's screenplay keeps it swift. A lot of portion in the middle is little slow and boring though.In an animated feature, the voice roles play important part as the expressions and acting never really matter. The voice cast includes Stephanie Beatriz, John Leguizamo, María Cecilia Botero, Diane Guerrero, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda and Wilmer Valderrama and to some sort, everybody has given something different. In two-three scenes, those verbal expressions and that cuteness in voice makes you feel those moments. Germaine Franco's musical numbers are vibrant and delightful and every song has got a different mood set in different situations. The language could be a problem sometimes, but that shouldn't be an issue for someone who cares about tunes.Talking about the visuals, Encanto is extremely enchanting. Creating that fantasy world with human-looking characters is always difficult but Disney's animators have done it before and here Encanto is just another spectacular addition in their list. Technical aspects of the film are fairly decent. It could have done better with the background score, especially in those emotional moments.Encanto is Directed by the duo Byron Howard and Jared Bush, who have previously collaborated for a successful film like 'Zootopia'. Encanto, being their first-ever joint directorial, is not that great but like mentioned above, it has its own moments. This isn't the first time we are seeing family values being redefined in an animated feature and expecting something wonderful like Pixar's 'Coco' would be too much. So, let's just be happy with this fairly enough family-film. In a nutshell, Encanto offers a sweet mixed-dish of entertainment, family drama, fantasy elements and emotional connect that can be enjoyed by the entire family together with normal expectations.RATING - 6/10*",Encanto
866,3,masonsaul,Incredible Disney animated movie,9/10,26 November 2021,"Encanto is another Incredible Disney animated movie that continues their winning streak with a fun, extremely vibrant and emotional film that also has great messages and mature themes, even if the narrative is predictable.Stephanie Beatriz gives an incredible lead performance and María Cecilia Botero, Diane Guerrero, Jessica Darrow and John Leguizamo all give great supporting performances.The direction by Jared Bush, Bryon Howard and Charise Castro Smith is superb, it's constantly visually inventive and extremely well paced. The animation is reliably perfect, ridiculously colourful and consistently visually stunning. The songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda are excellent.

867,4,rgkarim,"Encantop of It's Game For Fun and Feels, But Not The Adventurous Tale I had Expected",7/10,25 November 2021,"LIKES:The Animation:
No surprise, Disney is capable of masterpieces, and they continue to push the envelope for making these movies come to life. Encanto is certainly an incredible display of movement, smooth transitions and numbers that take the energy of Disney and amplify it tenfold to unleash on the big screen. It's dynamic, it's fun, and it utilizes so much of the environment that it presents itself as the musical it set out to be. The design explodes out in an amazing color, fantastic designs, and that campy details that bring you the happiness of a close knit Disney family. It's certainly a core element of the feels of the movie, and will easily capture your attention within seconds of starting.The Culture:
Disney has been big on bringing culture to their films and they once again managed to succeed in unleashing the honorable themes that come with it. Encanto is all about family, and the movie works hard to show that essence in the form of meals, helping the community, and trying to dig deeper into the darker corners that we all might hide. It's a beautiful representation of the work family building is, and tries to bring the other important elements of the culture into every scene they can. There is communion over dinner, the integration of the animals and plants made famous in the South American jungles, and the arts of crafting that are effortlessly integrated into the casa. The musical numbers bring the fervor and fire of the dancing, implementing the usual Disney movements, Encanto's numbers try to mix in a little South American dance spice and it works fantastically. Soon the mythos starts to leak into other elements and brings with it a grand display of the values and nuances that my limited studies have suggested they value. The result is a homely, and welcoming film that the young ones and young at heart will like, and potentially motivate families to dive a little more into cultural heritage.The House:
Encanto's main setting is this central house that the magic family lives in. You might think a house is not the most impressive Disney setting, but you'd be surprised at how well they utilized this enchanted villa into the story. The first is just the setting itself, a massive display of cultural architecture that we mentioned earlier to give symbolic nods to the Columbian architecture. Expanding on that, the rooms that the Familia have contain the magic that Disney can make, and opens the door for lots of new avenues to exploit in the future. Two of the rooms we see are the things of dreams, with the imagination oozing out in the extensive, physics defying, displays they have become as jungles and fields erupt into one magical room. Soon, the house turns into the obstacle course to find the clues to saving the magic as the dark parts of the house emerge. And then, the house becomes an actual character, an anthropomorphized obstacle that has its own means of adding to the story as it protects and pulls the family into its moving embrace. In a comical manner, the house bobs and weaves its own dance, having a lot of fun character though it never speaks a word to the characters it helps on a daily basis. The house was a fantastic piece to connect everything, and one of the biggest Disney elements of the movie for me.The Music:
You've got the Hamilton head manning the wheel on the original songs and he accomplishes things super well with his ingenuity. I found Encanto's work to be a lot more diverse than some of his previous work, but still holding the same quality and fluidity that he has mastered for so long. The opening number is fast and exhilarating, the mixture of stage show with the Latino spin I expected of him. Soon, the other numbers follow, always having that Broadway feel, but being curtailed to the movie to help hold the emotions of the movie moment and still be fun to sing. And he manages to add more genres to his repertoire in this film, and I loved the chorography they instill in the movies helping elevate the words in the quirky mixture of comedy and dance. Helping diversify the mixture of music, comes the nonmusical works, a score that again blends the festive nature of Latin culture and guides it towards serious sequence moments and festive parties. I actually preferred these moments to the big numbers and I absolutely loved how they brought the energy without being too extravagant.The Heart:
Encanto is a very relevant film to me, and like Disney does, has some great lessons that don't cross the political lines for me. Mirabel and her family have a lot of dynamics that are realistic, and within the walls of Casita, holds levels of storytelling that dug deep and made me feel attachment to my own family. I loved the big lessons of Mirabel not being a superhero, but was able to still work towards the mystery, which I think is important to note in the world of celebrities we idolize today. Other areas still run deep too, and that very core can impact a lot of people both young and old who watch this film. I loved the message being integrated well into the film, and not going too preachy as sometimes happens with messages in the film.DISLIKES:Character/Power Usage:
Character usage is not the worst in the movie, but I can't lie that after the opening of the film, I had hoped for more character usage and balance than what I got in this film. Encanto's powers are not the most unique, but they offered some potential to collaborate in this mission to save the magic and discover the secrets in the house. Yet, the powers were sort of wonky, with some of the characters only doing their powers to the extent of what you saw in the trailers. The magic of the rooms and that imagination we get in the opening numbers, sort of fades to the background and I would have loved more of that magic to come in to the story instead of just the songs.Music Over Full Plot:
Much like Frozen, Disney seemed to have put the songs before the story with this piece. I had fun with the numbers, but they became the center stage of the film where everything was about those numbers. The story's predictability was in part due to the budget going to these songs alongside the power struggles mentioned above, was because of all the focus on the soundtrack The movie has a great respect for the character motifs, and those elements of the story are strong, but I can't lie that it still did not have all the elements that Tangled, Zootopia, and Wreck it Ralph have made famous in their lineage. Throw in that the characters who were built up to be important are sort of haphazardly used, with only two really getting the primary integration I expect of these movies. Perhaps that will occur with Disney+ making another special a few years down the line, and their rooms, that magic, and their adventures will be in the next spin off that the House Of Mouse is making common.The Lack Of Suspense/Worthy Antagonist:
My least favorite part of the movie has to be the antagonist and the adventure elements missing in this film. Encanto, much like Soul, is more so a dive into the battlefield of human emotions and hardships of life. As great as this is, it still is missing the adventure theme that I've seen in other Animation Studios, lacking those mind bending creatures and myths for our heroine to conquer. The mystery was actually not that deep or complicated, and the struggles to find the answers came a little easier and quicker than what I kind of expected from the trailers. Again, a super powered household would expect to have bigger challenges, but it was sort of swept under the rug making it lack the same bite and suspense that again other films do so well. Even the antagonist was not the usual level of creativity that they've done, which though it fits into the story, still could have used a little more adversity to drive the bus.The VERDICT:
Encanto is a very fun film, with the heart and soul of the Latino culture and the values that many shows/movies have stated they hold. The animation and design are top notch as Disney always does, and I loved the energy imbued into the various scenes of the film. That house was a brilliant, multidimensional tool that accomplished so much and it allowed a lot of things to be integrated in the short span of time. The music of the film is definitely a high point, and floods much of the film to get you dancing in your seat and buying soundtracks later on after the movie gets older. Sadly, the movie has too many characters and too little time to integrate every character in adequate time to be meaningful to the story. Encanto needs more time and adventure elements of the story for a guy like me, blending that heart and proving that fortitude by giving a good opponent to storm. Yet, the puzzles, the mystery, and that usual Walt Disney fervor is a little tamer in this film, and I would have liked a little more of that sauce to break things up and give that punch that I quite enjoy. Still, the movie is worthwhile and fun for a theater visit, especially those who enjoy the musical theater element more than an adventure. And it is definitely a great movie for the family to check out this week if looking for harbor from Black Friday.My scores are;
Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Encanto

You´ll be thrilled with the many beauties and magic in this film.The film tells the story of Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz), a girl who is part of the Madrigal family, a family where everyone has super-magic powers. But, is Mirabel of the same alignment as they are? An unexpected event that puts the family in danger, can change everything.The storyline is well written. I really love the characters. They are funny and nice and the kind of people that everyone likes. My favorite parts are when Antonio Madrigal talks to the animals. I love animals and have always wanted to understand them. Watching this film gave me a greater desire to communicate with animals. This is magical! I also like the part when Mirabel is going to save the family and she says something funny. The special effects are terrific. Everything is super colorful. The background music is extraordinary; the music I like most is the adventure song when Mirabel takes off on her adventure. I love the adventure genre and this music accentuates it. As for costumes, I particularly love the costumes that show their tradition, yet at the same time, are contemporary outfits. They are so beautiful!The message of the film is that we need to believe in ourselves, Never give up, because in the end you'll find a light.I give Encanto 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults.

869,6,Anurag-Shetty,"One of Disney's best musicals, of all time.",9/10,30 November 2021,"Encanto tells the story of Mirabel(Stephanie Beatriz). Mirabel is very irritated because she's the only one in her family, without any magic powers.Encanto is an excellent film. Directors Jared Bush & Byron Howard have surpassed their previous animated movie, Zootopia(2016). This film is very unique & refreshing compared to most musicals from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This is mainly due to the musical genius of Lin-Manuel Miranda. The songs are foot-tapping & memorable. The animation is gorgeous. The 3D is duck-worthy. The humor makes you laugh raucously. There are several scenes that make you emotional & tear up, too. The vocal performances are the highlight. Stephanie Beatriz is spectacular as Mirabel. Maria Cecilia Botero is great as Abuela Alma. John Leguizamo is outstanding as Bruno. Maura Castillo, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, Carolina Gaitan, Diane Guerrero & Wilmer Valderrama are brilliant as Felix, Luisa, Julieta, Pepa, Isabela & Agustin, respectively. The supporting cast is perfect. Encanto is a must watch for kids & adults, alike. Go & have an absolute blast!",Encanto
870,7,jp_91,Be yourself!,7/10,28 November 2021,"""Encanto"" I liked but I was not charmed. The script touches on the theme of being yourself, something already seen previously, although in the film it is played with an animated perspective aimed at adults and that children can enjoy without problems. It is mentioned that the film talks about Colombian culture, but focuses more on musicals and fantasy, only being set in Colombia, the culture of that country is not really shown and the characters do not stop being fantasy, which does not bother but it would have been good to delve into the realistic aspect. The direction is good, the soundtrack has good songs and the digital animation is of great quality. Not the best animated film about Latin America, but it does fulfill its mission of entertaining and leaving a pleasant message.

871,8,statuskuo,A Colombian Mystical Tale,7/10,26 November 2021,"It must be law that Lin Manuel has to write music for anything related to a Hispanic storyline. Perhaps he's stretched thin as the music in this is forgettable. This does not steal away from the sweet message of finding how you fit into a family.Perhaps it is why the buoyancy of the movie relies on Mirable, a girl not given any special powers her relatives receive is not given to her.It isn't as ""charming"" as most Disney animation is. But maybe this a new turn for them. There isn't a villain to speak of. And some of the mystical borders on LSD level trips, but for the most part, it's hard to hate on pure entertainment. It does lag in some points. And also some of the relationships are confusing. Again, just a nice diversion from reality. It's enjoyable enough though I wonder how much of this will be lost to the children it wants to speak to.

872,9,ayoreinf,Charming and beautiful even if not so original,8/10,29 November 2021,"I always say I don't rate originality so very highly, if I did this new Disney fairytale would've been rated much lower (that is, by me, obviously). The story of a group/family of special individuals in which the non special member is the one everything will eventually depend on, has been told before more than once. But having said that, it doesn't make this recent Disney production any less charming or heartfelt. And it doesn't make it point any less poignant.Disney, as always, excels in story telling and characterization, nobody depicts characters better than Disney. They do it in seconds, almost effortlessly, relying on superb voice acting by the entire cast and brilliant animation that gives us the feeling we watch real flesh and blood actors not their animated reflections. Even the animals, which secondary to the human characters get their characters on screen. A tiger about to prey on rats for one tiny example or donkeys getting gathered by a self doubting strong woman. The animation is so astute it would be mind boggling if it wasn't Disney.Bottom line - it's a story about what it means to really be part of a family, about the strength of this unit. It's not original or surprising but it's charming, beautifully done, superbly acted and animated. This is exactly what I look for when I go to see a Disney's production, and that's exactly what I got.",Encanto
873,10,sirwillisiv,A subtly honest self-critique of Disney's recent projects...,8/10,25 November 2021,"Disney Animation hasn't impressed me in recent years because they've been more concerned with making films about flawless, marketable characters and it's really hindered their ability to take risks and tell interesting stories. Encanto is a step in a much better direction. In fact, it's probably the closest to a Pixar film that the studio has produced since Zootopia. There's a theme at its core and the film sticks to it. If you can look past the ""it's magic just because"" element that's per the Disney fairy tale norm, Encanto is a strong, character-driven story about the drawbacks of perfection and how having high expectations and ignoring flaws is destructive behavior. The focus is on the characters and how they aren't the perfect angels they think they are.It's like a subtly honest self-critique of Disney's most recent projects. A villain isn't needed, flawed characters are what's paramount to telling an effective story. The characters in Encanto have insecurities and prejudices to overcome and they work past it together through heartfelt writing and plenty of passionate musical sequences with a refreshing cultural touch. I can't say the songs are especially memorable given Disney's enormous history - some of the segues are a bit awkward, too - but they further the story, show how the characters feel and burst with plentiful color, emotion and distinctive visuals by an ensemble of characters bearing unique quirks. This is the power of a musical and even though it's not Disney's greatest lineup of songs, the effort still shows. Encanto is very enjoyable. Here's hoping it's the beginning of a new era for Disney Animation. More passion, more inclusivity, better stories.",Encanto
874,11,atractiveeyes,Okay,6/10,26 November 2021,"It's good but lacks the charm of Disney's previous movies. The animation is amazing. The film implies a beautiful important message but the story is not deep enough and it's poorly developed. The songs are not good enough as well. Characters are interesting but they are so many which makes it annoying. All in all, it's an average but also enjoyable family animation.

What may have looked generic and predictable from the trailer, turned out to be anything but. The characters are all so likeable and without any true villain. Even the house is likable. Like come on the flipping House is one of the best characters!The animation is gorgeous. No surprise there. And the music really sticks in your head
Not to mention how many of the songs strive to dig out a characters insecurities and personality. This film is seriously so good.

878,15,chris_rowe-881-168820,Very average,5/10,24 November 2021,"I get Disney is getting deeper and trying to show more important topics but this film felt very average, as a huge Disney fan I've seen 95% of the films, love some golden oldies but moana and coco are two of my favourites, I Was pumped for this.The first song played it just felt off, it kinda set the tone, the film isn't bad but there's nothing remotely special here, the animation and colours are a given at this point, it's Disney.. it won't look bad.The story was very dull, convoluted and over explained at several points, the humour failed and in a full cinema heard maybe 3 laughs. The characters were ok, not especially memorable and definitely quantity over quality, it had so much potential but did so little with it.Another film with a similar style was Vivo, a Netflix film that wasn't hugely advertised but was head and shoulders above this, musically, visually and on an entertainment level, ironically the go to music guy Did both films and the difference in quality is outstanding, vivo had 5/6 great songs, this had 1 ok one and few average at best.It'll entertain no doubt but you won't leave it like you did watching the first lion king or frozen or even a lesser title, it's easily forgotten and in disneys library doubtful one you'll revisit.1/10 is as ridiculous as 10/10 in this film, it's not horrible just not great.",Encanto
879,16,stefstars,Visually Pleasing but Story is Weak,7/10,26 November 2021,"Do not come to this film expecting another Coco or Moana, it doesn't even come close. It's unfortunate that the story and music couldn't match the gorgeous animation in this film. It's beautiful to look at and they inserted many elements of Colombian culture into the film, but the story feels incomplete. I'm wondering if another Frozen 2 situation happened where they had to rush production to make it to a certain release date. They obviously took their time with the animation and Colombian culture research, but left the story behind. It sort of felt like they didn't know what story to tell with these characters and in this whimsical, gorgeous setting so they made it up as they went along. The opening songs are expository and these alone indicate to the viewer that the story is either going to be a.) rushed or b.) incomplete. I'm thinking a combination of both.The recent Disney films clearly have a formula where we have to see our main characters as children and whatever their backstory is explained in said scene. In this case we see a mini Mirabel listening to her grandma tell the story of their magical house and how their family came to have magical powers. She is hearing this tale on the day she is supposed to discover what her magical power is - as all the trailers for this film revealed, she doesn't have one. This is another issue with this film, if you've seen all the trailers for this film, you know the story. I couldn't believe that only 2 minutes into the film they made it seem like you don't know that Mirabel doesn't have a power or 15 minutes in as if you don't know the little boy has a talking to animals power. The trailer is misleading in making you think that Mirabel is going to go on some huge Moana style adventure to save the magic but other than that it gives the whole movie away. I suppose the opening scene with her as a kid going to her ""what's my power"" ceremony is the best way to introduce her story and maybe if they would have fleshed this scene out more and subtly introduced the rest of her family and what their powers were, it would've been a better start. Unfortunately, we rush to the expository song that wasn't that good and felt like it went on and on and on. Like we get it. The song even knows how much of an ""information dump"" it is by repeating who's who in the family and what power they have a bunch of times. You will be left feeling ""we get it..""The soundtrack in this film was clearly inspired by Colombian music and that gives so much opportunity to creating great tunes but sadly there's only 2 good songs on this soundtrack. The best one being the one you hear in the trailer 'Colombia, Mi Encanto' sung by Carlos Vives. A lot of the songs were awkward to sit through, especially the one Luisa sang (the one with the super strength power). I like Lin Manuel but this soundtrack was not it. He writes for musicals, it makes sense that songs be expository in musicals cos... it's a musical. This is a film, it's like the writers counted on him to tell the whole story through song than make any effort into telling the story through film. It resulted in songs that dragged and were not memorable because you're just being told things rather than being given a glimpse into the character's emotions. It only happened with three songs. All of them not that great or memorable. Don't expect any ""Reflection"" or ""How Far I'll Go"" in this film.The pacing in this film is so off. The problem is literally resolved in a very anti-climatic way. The house falls apart after Mirabel confronts the grandma for being too hard on her and everyone else, she runs off to a river where the grandma conveniently finds her cos it's where Mirabel's grandfather passed away and where their miracle was born. In a Brave sort of way, their bond is fixed and thus they can go fix the house and the magic is back. Mirabel's only journey was to go find Bruno who is hiding in the house the entire time, so it wasn't much of a journey. A lot of fuss is made about this character cos he had the vision of the house falling apart but also visions that were not favorable to other people so because they didn't like his visions they didn't like him and so shunned him. It was pretty messed up. He's made up to be a villain, even in the poster art for the film, and then (unsurprisingly with recent Disney films) he's not a villain just misunderstood. He really is misunderstood though and what they did to him was just mean. There is no clear villain in this film, I was waiting for the ""mr. Handsome"" guy Maluma played to be a twist villain of some sort but nope. Unless you want to count the grandma as an initial villain turned good.Why did I give it a 7/10 despite all these flaws ? Because it did have a nice family story that it was trying to tell. Had the story been fleshed out and without counting on the songs to tell it, it could've been something special. The animation is beautiful, I did like the characters but sadly they're not going to be as memorable as the characters in other films like Beauty and The Beast or even the annoying Frozen films. I don't think I'll bother to watch this film again because one view was enough. It's a mess in terms of the story and music but it's a visual masterpiece. So much to do with the Colombian backdrop but clearly it overwhelmed them and they weren't sure what to do with it.Biggest flaw of all, they HAD to make a reference to ""Let it Go"" in the film. Ughhhhh. Disney stop. Please.My suggestion, wait until it's available on Disney +. The short film at the beginning though, that has better story telling than the actual film without any musical numbers or dialogue. If anything gets nominated from this, it should be that short.",Encanto
880,17,Benslie,Not revolutionary but enjoyable,8/10,28 November 2021,"One of the best aspects of this movie is honestly the animation for it. The animation in this movie isn't something revolutionary that we haven't seen before but it's still gorgeous. The animation can't help to distract that one of the weakest points of this movie is unfortunately the story. Don't get me wrong the story in this movie is pretty good and it's easy to follow and enjoyable for the whole family but parts of it just don't add up and it's pretty predictable. I also don't feel like all of the characters were given room to fully develop and I admit I forgot most of them existed. The story just feels like it didn't fully know exactly how to execute it properly and just mashed everything together. I feel like due to this odd execution of the story lead to the pacing of the movie feeling off. I didn't have any issues with the pacing of this movie but again due to the story, I definitely could feel the movie being like oh shoot we forgot about this one part and had to quickly solve it. Due to this, the pacing feels alright for most of the movie and the speeds up for certain parts. My personal favourite part of this movie outside of the animation is the music and score, composed by Germaine Franco and written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The music and score both gave in to that Latin culture but especially for the songs combined with more Western kinds of things to make a really good soundtrack. In the end, Encanto isn't a revolutionary animated movie but is still enjoyable and worth the watch.",Encanto
881,18,christophershobris,"Different World, Familiar Feel",7/10,28 November 2021,"That probably my favorite thing about this film, or the general idea of Disney making movies that take place in other countries that don't usually get the recognition. The setting in Colombia is perfectly captured and I really enjoyed being there. The vibrant colors, and the culture of the country are all on display. However, that's were the different ends, and the familiar begins. The story and characters feel very familiar and typical of Disney. Characters feeling left out or have everything they want but are unhappy. We've dealt with the outcast character before which is what the main character is. She's treated like the black sheep until a disaster forces her family to see her true purpose. It's all been done before in many other Disney films, heck not just Disney but other companies as well. DreamWorks, Illumination, they all have done it before. So unfortunately, Encanto doesn't feel that unique other than the country of Colombia. The songs are generic, and it's just not a film I'm going to remember. I'm ready for Disney to do something different entirely, actually go outside their comfort zone and give us something truly memorable. This is not it. I will say the animation however is gorgeous, the water looks so real it's good enough to drink, the animal design could use some work, and no leopard would ever be that friendly and upbeat. Another typical Disney trope where everything even a leopard is all sunshine and rainbows with sugar plums and unicorns on top. My final score is: 7.7/10.",Encanto

883,20,guskeller,"Sure to satisfy, unlikely to impress",7/10,27 November 2021,"Disney is consistent. Audiences can expect quality from Disney theatrical releases and know their movies will rarely misfire. The animation will excel, the cast will be recognizable, and the original music will be above average. Encanto delivers on all of this. Unfortunately, reaching the floor of Disney's quality control is about as far as Encanto goes. The story has a unique premise and worthy themes, but feels bland beyond that. There are too many characters and the conflict is played out, leaving the plot muddled and stale. As a whole, the writing is fine but lacks the bite to make the movie particularly memorable.Meanwhile, the acting is equally unexciting. The crowd of characters all have their quirks, but nobody steals the show or noticeably elevates the material. Overall, the bonds here just don't stick like some of Disney's better installments. The same can be said about the soundtrack (which is very good but hardly iconic) and the direction (which is intentional but slightly generic). Ultimately, the striking color and motion mixed with the flavorful designs and dynamic editing just isn't enough to carry Encanto to greatness. The movie is sure to satisfy viewers, but unlikely to leave lasting impressions.Writing: 6/10

885,22,downthehobbitholeblog,Heartwarming Disney Flick just in time for the Holidays- Parents Should Know!!,10/10,24 November 2021,"There are very few scary scenes in this movie. There is only a small amount of violence depicted but it is more realistic (think knife at the end of Tangled). The short beforehand is almost more scary than the movie. There is one scene that is a little darker with lightning and a couple that allude to violence and death- but those will fly right over the little viewers. They absolutely pack a heartwrenching punch for the older viewers- as intended. (Think parent death scene in Frozen). Will the Madrigal family be able to save their enchanted house before it's too late? Will Mirabel be able to help even though she's feeling so isolated from her family?!Overall, Disney's Encanto movie is a beautiful tribute to the strength of community, loving family, and being true to yourself. It is a more STORY driven movie than a grand adventure movie (like Inside Out, Mary Poppins, and Luca), so it can be a little slower. The animation is so stunningly engaging and detailed. The music is fabulous, Lin-Manuel Miranda was a part of the team to bring the music to life and you can feel that Vivo/ In the Heights musical blend. It just all fits together SO well. And we loved seeing a movie about a Columbian family with some gorgeous cultural nods. There are also some very deep themes in this movie to discuss. We've got discussion questions and a fuller review on our blog. In a world that is trying to ban books from the classroom for possibly upsetting someone, this movie comes out with a powerful storyline that reminds us that kids absolutely can process the fact that people cause pain and that they (and we) can do better. So inspirational, so fun. Such a great watch. Personally I'm a fan of the dual theater and at home releases BUT I am glad I saw this one in theaters.

889,26,WLRSky,Disney's Encanto - It's fine,7/10,30 November 2021,"I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this movie, to be honest. It looked like another Disney animated movie... and I don't usually watch those movies that much.But.. recently I just wanted to feel something.. and I started to really like the theater going experience. Just sitting in a dark room, and being immersed in the movie for 2 hours. So I saw it.The movie itself -I thought it was overall fine.The Opening Short FilmThe movie started with a short film (I think that's what many other Disney animated movies do). But it was So mediocre that I forgot about it almost immediately & remembered it when I started writing this review. (LOL)Pacing and MemorabilityThe first 20-30 minutes were kinda iffy, and I felt like giving it a 5, 5.5 out of 10. But thankfully, the movie got better and more interesting afterwards. However it still did not give anything remarkable, and I don't think I would remember it for long or rewatch the entire thing. (I would rewatch the parts that I liked, of course. )The AnimationIt's great. It's not like every shots are wallpaper-worthy or anything, but it is very colorful and I liked that. The level of detail in the animation is very impressive. They even animated the sand particles in a character's face in one scene.The MusicIt's a musical, so let's talk about the music.Overall, they were alright. They were not bad, but not particularly memorable. What I did like is how they decided to add some modern music feel to the songs. Even though I didn't like all of them, I did like the direction. (I hope we can hear some actual bangers in the future)Characters and ArcsBut the movie's strongest aspect is the characters and the messages conveyed by their growth. I liked almost all the characters, they had good designs and I liked that they had each unique abilities. Mirabel's sisters and brothers that have super strength, can change appearance, hear little noises, can make flowers -- it made the movie very fun.The movie explores the burden these characters have - and it shows the way they overcome it. It was very satisfying to see those arcs, and I think children( the target audience ) will be inspired by this story.Its ConclusionAnother thing I did not like - I thought the way they overcame the final ordeal was kinda weak. I honestly felt like there could've been another act or sequence. When the final ordeal was solved, I thought "" Is this how the story ends? I feel like there could be more room "" but it did end that way.Verdict : 6.5/10Overall, it is kinda average and mediocre at parts, but it also have charming and colorful parts. It is a watchable movie.",Encanto

892,29,blatherskitenoir,Charming but muddled focus,6/10,26 November 2021,"Pros: Visually stunning. Just, absolutely gorgeous. Charming, endearing characters, who manage to be unique and still work together well. And not a single dud amongst the songs, which are all catchy ear worms. Appealing to both the kids, and to adults, so you won't be suffering if you take the young people in your life to watch it.Cons: It touches on far too many big problems without picking one focus, or resolving any of them adequately.It cannot decide if it wants to talk about:--The responsibility which comes with power, and balancing obligation to others with healthy boundaries and avoiding being taken advantage of without becoming jaded.--Being the odd one out in a family, to the point where you are excluded, a second class citizen, or even a touch disliked, by the head of your family who blatantly favors others over you.--Having a skill or talent which is actively bad for you and being forced into a niche role by expectations and ability. Allowing yourself to enjoy something you aren't good at, and separating your 'job' from your 'hobbies'.--Failing to achieve expected life benchmarks, and dealing with the consequences of that in your life. Maribel could have easily been a stand in for all the Millennials and below who have failed to get a degree/ buy a house/ get married/ have kids/ etc. And are trapped in perpetual limbo state, straddling childhood and adulthood in their own lives and their family's eyes (she still sleeps in the friggin nursery, for crissakes)--Mental health, stress, and anxiety. Dealing with them in yourself, and supporting a family member who is struggling.--Losing your identity, or a major part of what you thought was your identity, and figuring out how to be ok and find yourself again after.--Family fighting or disagreeing, but still remaining family.--Being ok with being different. The costs of being special. The costs of being ordinary.As you can see, all of those are absolutely huge topics. While a film intended for a grown up audience could be allowed (if it's done well enough) to bring up and leave unresolved many of those things just for the sake of thinking about them, a children's movie needs to pick one or two and fully stick with it. Encanto doesn't want to say that yes, sometime you have to be sacrificed for the benefit of others, yes, it actually sucks not to be special, yes, sometimes family and fate plays favorites and it's not going to be you, and yes, sometimes things cannot be fixed or ever go back to the way it was. It wants to keep all of it's options open, and so it fails to make any choices and suffers for it.I will also say that it felt overly long (likely due to the lack of focus) and the 6 year old I took to see it was bored, wiggly, and itching to leave by the end. He played with his seat's up/down leg rest button more than he paid attention, and didn't rave about it or pester me with questions about favorite powers/ songs/ characters after it ended like he normally would.",Encanto
893,30,robertrutledge,A Step in the Right Direction for Disney,7/10,28 November 2021,"Disney's Encanto is a colorful and visually-stunning musical extravaganza celebrating family and Colombian culture. It is quite family-friendly, although that is not to say adults won't enjoy it as well. However, as a warning, this movie is practically a musical, so if copious amounts of synchronized song and dance isn't your thing, you probably won't enjoy this. That being said, the musical numbers are, for the most part, enjoyable, although at times somewhat cheesy and overly radio-friendly. Perhaps my biggest complaint about Encanto is that the songs don't accurately reflect the rich Colombian musical heritage. It would have been nice had traditional genres such as cumbia or vallenato been better represented in the musical numbers. Instead, most of the songs have somewhat of a cliché pop-rock a la Andrew Lloyd Webber feel to them. The lyrics, for the most part, are creative, but not exactly anything too memorable.The storyline revolves around Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz), a young lady who lives in a large magical house with her extended family in a small town high up in the Andes. Ever since the grandma (María Cecilia Botero) settled down there long ago after being displaced from her home and losing her husband Antonio, all of her descendants have been blessed with magic powers. Everyone except Mirabel, that is. Thus, much of the movie revolves around Mirabel's identity crisis and her resentful relationship with her grandmother.The house's life force is a magic candle that is perpetually lit. Without the candle, the house loses its magic and falls apart. One day, despite having no magic abilities, Mirabel has a vision that the candle starts going out and cracks start appearing in the floors and the walls. She warns her grandma, who pays her no heed. It is up to Mirabel to save the house and her family and finally prove to them her worth.Mirabel as a protagonist is a rejection of the typical Disney princess role (an archetype bestowed upon the character of her older sister Isabela). She has curly hair and wears glasses, and is at times somewhat socially awkward. No love interest makes or breaks her. This is a huge step forward for Disney. The company has received much criticism over their portrayal of female characters in movies such as Cinderella, Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty, where the female lead is only ""complete"" upon being united with their ""Prince Charming."" Mirabel, on the other hand, is a great female protagonist because of her imperfections and her independence.Having spent a considerable amount of time myself in Colombia, I appreciated the filmmakers' attention to detail. The architecture of the house is quite believable and even the food is reflective of typical Colombian cuisine. The underlying theme of displacement is a very strong sentiment to millions of people in Colombia and other Latin American countries, and Disney does a good job tastefully portraying such a traumatic and difficult experience. The town where the movie takes place is fictitious, although it appears to be a representation of different ""pueblos mágicos"" (magical towns) scattered throughout the country. I personally had an amazing experience in Colombia and, in my opinion, Encanto does a great job (for the most part) paying homage to the country.To wrap things up, Encanto is an enjoyable movie, although I may have done things a little differently. It seems as if there were too many characters to explore in such a short runtime. As my friend pointed out, Mirabel's sisters' character developments literally happen within the span of their respective songs and seem rather abrupt. Something else I'm a little confused about is how Mirabel had the vision of the house falling apart in the first place if she apparently has no magic abilities. I won't give away the ending, but it feels overly ""Disney."" The humor is rather hit or miss. The use of Spanish is kind of forced. I would have preferred them to have implemented more Spanish for authenticity's sake (incorporating subtitles) since so few people in Colombia speak English. Still, the story is original and feels fresh. The visuals are stunning. The musical numbers are fun, although at times a bit exaggerated. I wouldn't mind watching this again.",Encanto

895,32,josiahliljequist,"Encanto is enchanting, even if a little obvious",7/10,24 November 2021,"So Encanto has some-not a lot- but some of that Disney escapism that makes you forget where you're seated and takes you to another place. One track shots showing the boy utilize his animal-whispering gift, and the entire song/set pieces of ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" are definite highlights, and give you some hope for future Disney movies. The movie excels when focusing on the music and the ways that the characters' powers can be utilized for unexpected comedic relief, but it slows to molasses and becomes semi-cringy when focusing on the themes of ""finding your true self"" and generational misunderstanding. It's not that these aren't valuable themes, it's just that it's so beaten over your head, and so telegraphed that it loses any power it could have had by the end. Without an obvious underlying message, I think I would've enjoyed this movie just as much, if not more, as a sort of Raidersesque type adventure movie devoid of obvious meaning.But the movie is not a lost cause; the middle section of the movie has immense energy (sparked by the fantastic number ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"") and has some of the most creative, colorful, and gorgeous visuals I've ever seen in a Disney movie.So watch the movie for the songs, sounds, sights, shadows, lighting, and just try to swallow the force fed message down as smoothly as possible. It's worth it, even if it's not up there with Disney's best.",Encanto

897,34,parksiet,A charming new Disney movie,8/10,25 November 2021,"Encanto totally delivers on being Walt Disney Animation's 60th film, and that's definitely some big shoes to fill! I am so happy to report that it's a wonderful film, it totally exceeded all my expectations. It tells a sweet and heartfelt story about family and valuing what others of different skill sets can offer. It really gets to the heart of the theme of family, and I loved how they used the house itself (which is basically a setting and a character) to thematically connect to the family aspects. And wow do they ever need to build this house at Disneyland, it's so cool! The movie takes place pretty much all inside and around the house, and I loved the creative ways they made it feel much larger and expansive than it is.Like I said earlier, I wasn't overly excited for this movie, but it managed to really sweep me away. The trailers just didn't sell me on it, and it turns out they really undersold the movie. It's a great film to see with family, and visually spectacular! The animation, in classic Disney fashion, is stunningly beautiful. It's super detailed and complex, filled with fantastic colours, inventive lighting and brings the story to life in such a magical way. The world building is also great, but I wish they dove a little bit deeper into the mythology and background of the story. The movie does move at a brisk pace and is fairly short, so I feel it could have benefited from an extra 15 or 20 minutes. I did really love the story too, and was surprised that it kept me guessing so much; it kept subverting my expectations and had some really cool twists, all of which made me very happy! It is also a great depiction of real world cultures and issues (even powerfully touching on immigration) and employs many magical realism techniques.I really loved the characters too; they were all so unique and memorable! Stephanie Beatriz was really charming as Mirabel, and fit the role well, but unfortunately her character seemed to be outshined by the other characters due to the fact they all have powers and she doesn't. She does make an impression but the movie struggles to make her seem like the true lead of the movie. Truly my favourite character was Bruno (voiced by John Leguizamo)... but as the movie says ""We don't talk about Bruno!"" so you'll just have to see it to see why he's so great!And how can you talk about this movie without bringing up the songs?! Lin-Manuel Miranda knocks in out of the park once again (are we surprised?), crafting songs that are all so memorable and unique, they truly feel like a blend of styles and work so well. My only problem is, and this is very minor, is that there wasn't one standout song, an equivalent to ""Let it Go"" from Frozen or ""How Far I'll Go"" from Moana. The songs worked well with the story, but unfortunately seem to stop the plot when they come on rather than progress the story through the song, creating ""song-breaks"". (Although a few managed to keep it going). Still, the music was phenomenal and a highlight of the movie, I just had a few issues overall. And of course... the songs are indeed stuck in my head!Overall I really enjoyed the movie! It's filled with emotions and is a magical, heartfelt film to be seen with your family! I think of it came down to it I enjoyed Raya and the Last Dragon a little more but this was still very very good, and exceeded all my expectations!",Encanto

The movie itself would be fairly entertaining, about a five, if the soundtrack was Disney quality. About midway through, I said to my wife, ""You sure this was Disney? It's got the Miranda taint to it"". Rapid unlyrical rambling; clashing noises in lieu of music.Low and behold it was Miranda...minus two stars for that. How does Disney pass on their endless pool of talent to tap a street musician you'd quickly hustle by to save your ears.Your kids won't be so singing a single song from this tomorrow, let alone weeks from now.

It is absolutely incredible what computer animation can do now a days. Perfect landscapes, awesome architecture and beautiful rendered characters but... ooops. Is this a story for your kids or grandchildren? During the entire movie maybe I heard a kid next to me laugh twice... and some were sleeping. Is there a story to understand? Seems you have to take along with you your local movie club enthusiast and let him explain what is going on; if he can! My only positive remark is that the crew managed to collect quite a few of Colombian beautiful samples like the incredible Caño Cristales, the mountains peaks, typical coffee farms and the famous yellow butterflies of Colombias's Nobel price winner Gabriel García Marquez. But where is the Magical Realism he is so famous for? A Magical house? Fail! For me the director and all the crew should go back to college and study again why and how Magical Realism was praised for being a unique literary movement of the 60-70's. And relax, Sofia Vergara is not around!It seems Disney should rate their movies and give them some ""intellectual"" stars rating.

913,50,mane_,The first new Disney film in years,9/10,26 November 2021,"In the last few years, Disney has struggled to make standalone films that feel truly original, and has relied heavily on sequels and remakes to draw revenue.Encanto marks a major turning point for the company. The film proves how much Disney has matured in its storytelling over the years through compelling dialogue, diverse characters and resonant themes.But at the same time, it doesn't stray from the magic that drew audiences to Disney in the first place. Striking animation, charming characters and beautiful scores are just some of the things we've come to expect from Disney films, and this one more than delivers.The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because I personally felt like the storyline wasn't too strong, but it was so well executed that it could easily be ignored. So I highly recommend this to anyone looking for what to watch.",Encanto
914,51,scoob-72405,Generic and substandard forgettable film,1/10,25 November 2021,"This film seems like it is trying to take old Disney movie ideas and scenes and remake it into a new film, however the idea and the story don't quite piece together well making for a lackluster. The music is alright but slows down the story and at times seems redundant.

916,53,Mishutka22,Entertainments for entertainments' sake.,5/10,27 November 2021,"What I really liked is the storyline of Bruno. He is a real hero. I'd like to see a movie about him. Because I really sympathize with his sacrifice and transformation. That was really touching.But the other... I agree that topic of this story is important and touching. Despite it is written on the forehead and nothing should we decrypt. But story set the wall between my perception and actual story (Encanto) by the wonder from nowhere just in the beginning.""Come on! They are magical family! I'm mortal"". Yes, I understand that ""magic"" is just a method of the storytelling, but I didn't feel as a part of this story. And the explanation the origin of ""magic from nowhere"" is really poor. That's why it seemed as entertainments for entertainments' sake.Also, Mirabel doesn't have flaws. She is wonderful girl all the story. She wants to do best to her family despite her shortsighted Granny from the beginning to the end. Where is her transformation?Some says that ""it's like ""Coco"". Come on... the only similarity is in the appearances of Hector and Pedro. ""Coco"" is a story of a boy who tries to remove the taboo, rises against his family and going through obstacles he finds his family, fixes broke connections and finds his vocation. Do you see that in ""Encanto"" something is missed? That's why ""Encanto"" is superficial and I didn't worry about ""la casa"" (no really danger and stakes).",Encanto

Poor story and lame songs.

It had a good message but there wasn't much of an adventure like most Disney movies. There was only one song I enjoyed which is not good for it being a movie where the characters are Colombian. They have great music so what happened here? Aside from that the movie was beautiful to look at and my 4 year old son and husband loved it.

922,59,palm_mahir,Family is the most powerful community.,9/10,28 November 2021,"Encanto gives us an important messages about family. The movie shows how powerful family magic can be. Every members of the Madrigal family has a gift except for Mirabel. You don't need to have a gift to be special in the family, you just need to be in the family to be special. The movie does have a great Disney music. The movie knows that they don't have to give us a solo Disney princess song, they know that they just have to give us a Disney music with some powerful messages inside of it and that's what makes the song in this film feels powerful. The story telling is so emotional and the film actually has a heart inside of it. Now if you're asking for the weak point of the movie is that the story telling stays in the same places, there's alot of characters some I care, but some I don't and the animation felt a little cheap for a Disney animated movie.Verdict: 9/10.

I wasn't expecting it to be a 10/10 movie but I didn't want to hate it either. But I gotta say I really loved this movie. Even though I don't label it as a masterpiece like Pixar's Coco there is genuine heart and entertainment in this animated film. Mirabel Madrigal is my new favorite Disney gal I highly recommend seeing this one for kids, animation fans, Latinos/Columbians who celebrate their Columbian culture and moviegoers.

We laughed so hard especially at the donkeys falling from the sky during Luisa's solo and anytime Dolores had lines. I cried a bit at the end because Mirabel was so relatable. I also liked how there wasn't a big hero's journey that took her far away like every other movie and everything took place in her town. Loved seeing all the diverse characters and hearing Spanish. BEAUTIFUL culture and bright colors throughout the movie.

The theatre was full of families gathered to watch Encanto. The story was full of emotion and heart , visuals were stunningly beautiful and colorful , the music by Lin Manuel Miranda was spellbinding ( although there was no song like Let it go but it was really good ) , the voice cast was brilliant , and the representation of Colombian culture is really beautifully done. This is legitimatly the best DISNEY movie since Moana and yes better than Raya and the Last Dragon ( I liked Raya a lot btw ). Go grab your familia and head to the theatre. With Raya and the Last Dragon and Encanto , this has been a really great year for Disney Animation.

930,67,sjbgnmnrqa,It's about family since latin's perspective,8/10,25 November 2021,"Encanto it's a movie about the character's inside conflict. Just like Soul, this movie tries to being an introspective way to tell a magical story and it's great! Disney have ever understanding the magic the European way, and how they portray the ""magical realism"" of García Marquez shows that there's a world to be explored in terms of adventure and magic. It's not Aladdin, it's not Frozen, it's an original story for Latin people. That's why some North American families could not relate themselves with this story and that's okay, because the conflict of Alma's grandmother it's the conflict of a lot of Latin mothers around the world.Yeah, not all the songs are catchy as always, but I think the great lesson for the kids at the end of the movie worth the price of the ticket.

I couldn't wait for it to be over. If it wasn't for my kid we would get up and ask for refund. Disney was good when they were making classic fairytales. The Little Mermaid; Beauty and the beast, Aladdin. They should really get back to that.So, save your money and see it when it comes out to rent.

941,78,masonrobledo-37610,A Highly Imaginative But Very Short Disney FIlm,8/10,28 November 2021,"Encanto is the new Disney which is finally out, it has songs by Lin-Manual Miranda, it's directed by Jared Bush, Byron Howard who worked on Bolt, Tangled and Zootropolis, this looks a lot more interesting then Raya and the Last Dragon despite how much i enjoyed that, so this shoud be a fun and creative but also interesting watch!, so i watched it yesterday and... i really liked it, a bit more then Raya but not without it's few to be expected flaws, so let's talk about it.The animation as expected is fantastic and highly fun, it's bright, creative and well rendered, the characters have that great classic Disney look for 3-D, especially their magic that thy uese which is quite fun, the characters are quite fun and very understandable as you like each and every one of them equally, along with tremdous voice acting especially from Stephanie Beatriz and John Leguizamo, of course the songs from Miranda are cheery and catchy and the score is rather nice, but also very funny in it's speed and slapstick which all works rather nicely and dramatically works well with the story, i also like how there is no villain in the film, at first you'd think there is but actually no there isn't it, which is a nice change, the story is interesting enough and also quite deep and thoughtprovoking.However there are a few flaws that did bother me a little, like the fact that the movie felt... short, yeah it goes by so quickly that i thought there would be a bit more to it, but it oes wrap up rather quickly, maybe it might be i enjoyed it or becauase it took place in one area, not sure but i thought it'd be longer, also the movie does get predicable and you can easily see what's gonna happen and the film sometimes go on for a little bit long with some scenes that i dunno should of been a bit shorter really.Yeah i really had a great time with Encanto, it's imaginative, fun, hillarious, touching, it has fun characters, great songs and wildly colourful animation, but despite how short it felt and being predictable as ever, i wanted more out of it really but with what we got, it's good enough, it's no Zootropolis or Moana but better then Raya and big hero 6 at least so i reccommend this to families and to Disney who will defintley get something out of it to enjoy, so go and see it and have a magical time!.. or try to anyways.I'm going to give Encanto a 8.5/10.",Encanto

Had an important message to children to learn from your mistakes, but I hated the singing in the movie. I don't know why but whenever there's a musical scene in a movie it just completes removes my interest toward the movie.

The music is fantastic as well; the entire time I kept thinking how I couldn't wait to go home and listen to the soundtrack and learn the songs with my kids. But the best part of all was the message. I went into the theater expecting to see a cute Disney movie and came out feel profoundly moved. It's fun for kids, but the message I got from it was one I needed as a parent and a daughter. From the short at the beginning and throughout the movie I was reminded of how often we humans accidently pass on our traumas to our children, but there is hope and there can be healing. I love the message in this movie that the key to healing is honesty, self reflection, and of course the powerful love we have for each other in our families. It was exactly what I need and what I really think much of the world needs right now. Fantastic movie all around.

Maybe it is more appreciated by older kids/adults. To me it's very obvious that this story is about intergenerational trauma and specifically the experience of first-generation children who are held to standards of ""perfection"". I relate to every single character in this movie- be it the oldest sister who has to be ""strong"" and carry everyone's burdens, the sister who has to be ""perfect"" etc. This is a BEAUTIFUL and complex story that had me in tears many times. For those that couldn't relate- Good for you, this movie wasn't for you.",Encanto

The film faces the struggle of not fitting in and family conflict. Shows how personal struggle does not have to be faced alone.The songs are brilliantly written with excellent literary devices in play as well as simply being bops. A mixed emotion I have is with one song that is in Spanish where the literary devices aren't picked up unless you are a Spanish speaker so while tone isn't lost in the scene, the underlying meaning is.I laughed, I cried, and I was never bored. Gorgeous animation. I found myself easily attached to characters.Certainly a film that children will enjoy and adults can respect.

959,0,jboothmillard,Spencer,6/10,21 November 2021,"I saw the trailer for this film and recognised it was about Princess Diana, and then the name of the actress came up and I was stunned, this is described as ""a fable based on a true tragedy"", and one that I could not miss, directed by Pablo Larraín (Jackie). Basically, on Christmas Eve 1991, at the Her Majesty's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, the British royal family are preparing to spend the Christmas holidays. Among the attendees is Diana, Princess of Wales (Kristen Stewart), whose marriage to Prince Charles (Poldark's Jack Farthing) has become strained following his affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. The staff, led by the capable Major Alistair Gregory (Timothy Spall), prepare for the royals' arrival, while Diana drives through the countryside. On the verge of a breakdown, she avoids heading to Sandringham until running into Royal Head Chef Darren McGrady (Sean Harris). She recognises the long-abandoned neighbouring estate, Park House, it used to be her childhood home. Diana's sons William (Jack Nielen) and Harry (Freddie Spry) are excited to see her, but she does not attempt to socialise with the royal family, who mostly ignore her. Diana's only friend at the Estate is Royal Dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins), who gives her encouragement and fulfil the obligations expected of her. Diana finds a book on Anne Boleyn in her assigned bedroom. She begins to have dreams about Boleyn (Amy Manson). Diana has a hallucination of her at a Christmas Eve dinner and comes to believe that Boleyn's ghost is haunting her, being a fellow abandoned royal wife. The Queen (Stella Gonet) gives Diana a few concerned stares throughout the meal. Diana tries to visit her childhood home in the middle of the night, but royal guards stop her, mistaking her for an intruder. On Christmas Day, Diana attends the service at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, where she notices Camilla (Emma Darwall-Smith) among the gathered crowd and is photographed by hundreds of intrusive journalists. She later joins the Royal Family for the traditional Christmas family portrait but finds the experience difficult. She later has an awkward conversation with Charles, as she concerned over William and Harry's participation in a pheasant shooting the next day. He rebuffs her and advises her to develop a stronger sense of separation between her public and private lives. Diana is upset after Charles has privately arranged for Maggie to be sent to London and refuses to have new Dresser Angela (Laura Benson) help her with clothing choices and dressing. Rumours are spread that Maggie planted the Boleyn book in Diana's room and made critical comments about her mental health. Diana questions McGrady about Maggie, but he denies that she had done anything wrong. Major Gregory attempts to encourage Diana to conform to the pressures of royal life, but she dismisses his advice. Diana imagines wounding herself with a pair of wire cutters given to her by McGrady. She avoids the formal Christmas Day dinner, choosing instead to run to her childhood home, accessing it with the wire cutters. While she explores the house, memories of her happier childhood flash before her, and she sees herself dancing and running in various places in several younger stages. She considers committing suicide by throwing herself down a flight of stairs, but the ghost of Boleyn stops her, she instead rips apart her pearl necklace. On Boxing Day, Diana awakes in her room to find that Maggie has been called back from London. The two take a walk to Maggie responds by admitting that she is in love with Diana. A nearby beach, where Diana talks about her mental and marital problems. After leaving the beach, Diana rushes to the pheasant shoot and walks out in front of the crowd of hunters. She tells Charles that she is leaving and taking William and Harry to London, an arrangement to which Charles hesitatingly agrees. Diana bids farewell to Maggie and McGrady; Major Gregory returns the Boleyn book to the library. As they drive away, Diana and her children sing the song ""All I Need Is a Miracle"" by Mike & the Mechanics. In the distance, a scarecrow that Diana had made when she was younger is seen, now wearing her royal clothes. Diana drives to London, where she begins the process of raising her children independently. They go to a KFC drive-thru for food, and she gives the name ""Spencer"". Diana looks over the River Thames, uncertain of her future but no longer burdened by memory or royal responsibility. Also starring Richard Sammel as Prince Philip, Elizabeth Berrington as Princess Anne, Lore Stefanek as the Queen Mother, James Harkness as Footman Paul, Niklas Kohrt as Prince Andrew, Olga Hellsing as Sarah Ferguson, and Matthias Wolkowski as Prince Edward. Stewart is a spitting image of the pop-culture icon and is compelling as the woman suffering severe depression issues and trapped by authority, Spall is interesting as the stony-faced aide, and the support of Hawkins and Harris as the household staff is good. I wasn't expecting it to be as disturbing as it was at times, Princess Diana is known to have had her issues, seeing her depicted on screen on the verge of a nervous breakdown, having bulimia and self-harming is hard to watch, and you do feel her claustrophobia. Besides Diana's emotional distress and the royal duty stuff, the food looks delicious and the preparation of it is lovely to watch, the costume design and colour is fantastic, and the score by Jonny Greenwood is fantastic, whether it is factually true and accurate or not, it is a fascinating psychological drama. Good!",Spencer
960,1,Quinoa1984,Sandwich cringing times. Stewart is brilliant and Pablo Larrain captures a suffocating atmosphere,10/10,7 November 2021,"It would appear Pablo Larrain has done it again, following up on Jackie, another story of a woman depicted in an environment and film stock of despair with a film that is related to that while standing on its own as a story that lays bare a public figure to the gaping heart that's buried underneath years of speculation - where the image of someone like Diana has to be stripped away, and where the clothes themselves become like a prison of everyday life.This was at times (a phrase I don't throw around lightly) downright Kubrickian in the equal sense of cinematographic grandeur and surreality/absurdity (here more the former than the latter), where there is so much space to take in and close-up faces of restraint and yet everything is heightened and even horrific. This is a film that isn't without nuance, but Lsrrain knows full well as Kubrick did to get at a deeper truth you got to make some bold decisions in directing a performance or making a shot so distinctly from our protagonist's pov that itself is a comment on the psychological spaces.And this is by an easy mark Stewart's most successful, soulful, heartbreaking performance where the little tics she sometimes (arguably many times) has serves this character 1000%. Adding to this everyone around Diana - save for Hawkins' Maggie - is trying to maintain the status quo, and Spall is a particular stand out as well.And you cringe because so much of this is about behavior, that for all of her mental and psychosomatic fragility this Diana is far more recognizable as a human being than any of these glowering royals - keeping the place cold as can be of course - and there is humor that has almost no choice at points but to come out from the cringe, but also just cringe at the sense of a human being caught in all of the hard rock places. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say there isn't a more torturous and uncomfortable dinner scene in modern cinema as from the POV of one character as here (those pearls falling down oy).Another point of comparison in what I hope is a complimentary sense and it may be because of watching it so recently, but Dune came to mind; how a filmmaker can with this brooding yet delicate and consuming precision give you a total sense of how it FEELS to be a figure with all the pressure on them and st a moment where change MUST happen or all is lost.Of course there are some differences as to how and where the hero and heroine of these respective movies go to break into what they gave to become - but I'm struck by in particular with Larrain he emphasizes the ghost figure, with Anne Boylen coming in like a figure out of Gothic tradition, that what she tells her sons at one point about Tense - past, present, future - is what it's all about. Spencer is a staggering portrait of order and disorder, of a figure in a place where everything has to be presented and be Just So, and all one can think is... someone really could use a friggin' hug!",Spencer
961,2,CinemaSerf,"Stewart is good, but the narrative is way too one-dimensional.",6/10,9 November 2021,"Kristin Stewart could certainly not be accused of being half-hearted here. She immerses herself completely in this depiction of a rather unstable woman dealing with the pressures of her fame and her family. The extent of any authenticity as to the feelings and experiences by the real life Princess is anyone's guess, so though I did appreciate her effort, I felt the rest of the film took a rather uncompromising view on other people who are either dead, or unable to retaliate against this somewhat one-sided portrayal of a scenario that all concerned have subsequently admitted was way more nuanced and complex than presented in this overly-simplistic depiction. It doesn't help that the opening scenes purport to be Queen Elizabeth's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, but look nothing remotely like that distinctive building - and from there on in, the story speculates wildly on real life events in a fashion that I just found irritating, implausible - hysterical, even. Her ability to randomly roam the countryside (with or without her children) without any security beggars belief somewhat, and the somewhat curious references to ""currency"" alluding to the double edged swords of a privileged no pain no gain existence is all just too contrived. This portrayal of an emotionally struggling lady is to be commended, but it has little to do with reality and as a man who lived in the UK throughout the rise and fall of this flawed individual, much of this comes across as little more than a clumsy attempt to capitalise on a tragic story with scant regard to anyone else who actually had to endure at that time - or, indeed, to fact.",Spencer

963,4,blanbrn,Haunting and intimate in the moment look at a lady of power.,5/10,7 November 2021,"""Spencer"" is one eye opening film and look at a lady who seems backed into a corner it's like she wants escape and hopes for joy from her life of royal feel and wealth. The film has it's focus on the 1991 Christmas holiday at the Sandringham family estate with Princess Diana(Kristen Stewart) with her two sons and it's a tense time during her life as she wants to break away from husband Prince Charles. The holiday feast involves a get together with dinner and being with royal family and friends, while Diana reads to escape too, the film even shows her in a wild daydream. The scenes shot are tense showing Diana backed into corners in a very emotional state that haunts. The makeup and costumes that Kristen wore makes good for along with her performance believable as Diana. Really I would have wished to see more of a historical and autobiographical type film as this film is more of a take of her life just in a certain moment even though it entertains with Stewart's performance.

964,5,MOscarbradley,Is this magnificent film really about Princess Diana?,10/10,10 November 2021,"The first thing you have to get your head around is that Pablo Larrain's new film ""Spencer"" isn't 'about' Princess Diana, at least not in any literal sense, although Diana herself is never off the screen. Perhaps a title at the beginning, 'a fable based on a true tragedy', is the clue. This is a fantasy or maybe simply a tragedy, (of the Shakespearean variety), in which everything is filtered through the gaze and the mind of a mad Princess of Wales, (Hamlet and the Court at Elsinore as imagined, rather than actually seen, by Ophelia). Larrain and screenwriter Steven Knight's Diana may as well be a fictional character since nothing we see is 'real' even if some of it may be true.It's set over the three days of Christmas at Sandringham, presumably after Charles and Diana have separated and Diana has returned for the holidays. In this version of events, that clearly never happened, she is already deeply disturbed, blaming the Royal Family and Charles' affair with Camilla for everything. The only affection she gets is from her two sons and her servants, particularly her dresser, (a superb Sally Hawkins). Her in-laws hover in the background like zombies ready to devour her and like zombies are mostly silent with only Charles and the Queen, (as well as William and Harry), given anything to say, (Charles tries to be sympathetic, the Queen doesn't). ""The Crown"" this isn't. Knight has no sympathy for any of them though it's never clear if he believes that they were responsible for Diana's supposed breakdown, Only dresser Maggie, (Hawkins), head chef Darren, (Sean Harris), and senior equerry Major Gregory. (a brilliant Timothy Spall), are prepared to indulge her and let her go her own way.Of course, none of it is true. This could be any woman having a serious mental breakdown anywhere and at anytime and stylistically this is a tour-de-force built around a phenomenal performance by Kristin Stewart as Diana. Yes, she captures the mannerisms perfectly but is there any evidence that Diana was as off-the-rails as she's presented as being here and while the Royal Family are certainly as dysfunctional as any dysfunctional family could be, I've never for a moment believed they were ever this cold, (this is the chilliest Christmas of any screen Christmas I've seen), but this is not the point.The fault lines governing relationships and the fragility of human behaviour is what has always interested Larrain and this film is no different. Despite streaks of humour this is far from comfortable viewing and it's unlikely it will prove popular at the box-office. Stewart's Oscar, however, is virtually guaranteed; this is as fine a piece of acting as I've ever seen and other Oscar contenders such as Jessica Chastain and Lady Gaga will have to resign themselves that 2021 just wasn't their year.",Spencer
965,6,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Spencer,6/10,13 November 2021,"6/10 - I really wanted to fall in love with this film, but found it lacking in a lot of the heart it needed to convey this story with the sympathy and genuineness necessary in the story of such a layered and pained woman.

966,7,stevendbeard,Good Portrayal But Boring,3/10,14 November 2021,"I saw ""Spencer"", starring Kristen Stewart-Charlie's Angels_2019, Panic Room; Jack Farthing-Poldark_tv, Blandings_tv; Sean Harris-The Green Knight, Serena and Sally Hawkins-The Shape of Water, Layer Cake.This is a movie that is based on true incidences surrounding the life of England's Princess Diana-Spencer was her maiden name. Kristen plays the troubled Diana-in a very good portrayal-who was having mental health issues during her marriage to Prince Charles, played by Jack. As she was contemplating the end of her marriage to Jack, Kristen struggled with bulimia, her fame with the English paparazzi and even her place in the Royal family and all the structured rules that she had to follow. Sean plays the royal chef and Sally is Diana's personal servant that-at least according to this movie-had stronger feelings for Diana than anyone knew. Some parts of the movie were almost interesting-scenes with her kids-but overall, it was just boring. I'm pretty sure that the Royal family will not be too happy with some of the portrayals here. Even my wife-who is a big fan of Princess Diana-kept looking at the time and saying that she wished it would be over soon.It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including some partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either but if you really want to see it, I'd wait until it comes to tv.",Spencer

Kristen Stewart proves entirely compelling in the title role she is brilliant. The challenge starts with resemblance, and Stewart gets Diana's wounded melodramatic manner, with the sulky eyes, the slight tilt of the head mannerisms down to a tee.The marriage of Princess Diana and Prince Charles has long since grown cold. Though rumors of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at the Queen's Sandringham Estate. There's eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. But this year, things will be profoundly different. SPENCER is an imagining of what might have happened during those few fateful days.The film is It's beautifully shot. The cinematography has disturbing imagery that leads its self to the psychological horror of the relationship and drama that the couple inflicted on one another.The film has beautiful sets with excellent production value. Not to mention the splendid wardrobe. Especially in some of Diana's more iconic outfits (she had many), Kristen Stewart really does look like Diana it is uncanny.This is a haunting movie. Spencer is an unnerving film. At the same time artfully well acted and very amusing, smart and stylish .

The English vampires pictured here, plotting under the wings of ringleaders Liz and Chuck, are far scarier than their American cousins--and there's no need to add shirtless sinewy werewolves to SPENCER's deplorable stew of riffraff. From the moment the evil-eyes pirate wench Liz smugly smirks as she slurps her fish-head soup (32:56), viewers can sense the impending doom encircling the title character. The throbbing strings constitute a far more menacing musical score than those provided for any of the previous twilight vampire outings, with Liz and Chuck truly convincing as pernicious and inhuman creatures willing and able to suck the lifeblood from an entire nation with their conspicuous consumption, environmental depredations and wanton immorality. No one will exit a theater after experiencing SPENCER with a gram of respect for the self-styled British ""Royal Family.""",Spencer
969,10,Pairic,Moving drama,8/10,8 November 2021,"Spencer: What might have happened at Christmas 1991 at Sandringham, obviously the dialogue and much of the action is imagined but it is informed by events in Dianna's (Kristen Stewart) life and later revelations. Di is under pressure, acting erratically, suffering from Bulimia, stress, depression. To make things worse she becomes aware that the pearl necklace Charles has bought for her is similar to the one he gave to Camilla Parker-Bowles. His philandering is becoming obvious to all. On top of that the paparazzi pursue her rather than Charles and Camilla. Di also has disturbing visions of Anne Boleyn, seeing herself as Boleyn and taking advice from her. Alienated from the adult royals she depends on her sons, especially William for support. She also turns to a maid, Maggie (Sally Hawkins) and the head chef Seán (Darren McGrady) for friendship and advice. Major Gregory (Timothy Spall) appears at first to be a glorified MC/Butler but plays a broader and more enigmatic role. The Queen (Stella Gonet) emerges quite well from this drama though Charles (Jack Farthing) comes across as an insipid Cad. Pheasants and a scarecrow provide apposite metaphors but the Boleyn scenes are a tad OTT imo. An intriguing tale of Dianna's rebellion against the restrictions of royal life and her quest for independence. Impressive performance by Stewart, Spall, Hawkins and McGrady. 8/10.",Spencer

971,12,I_Ailurophile,"Tremendous, upending and exceeding my expectations",10/10,18 November 2021,"Cheeky, clever marketing suggests a straight telling of a prominent woman's separation from her husband - it's emphatically not. Within the first moments a line of superimposed text informs us the feature is ""A fable from a true tragedy"": the names are familiar, but the recounting is one specific representation, or perhaps more so an interpretation. This is a psychological drama; a twisted fairy-tale of discontent, personal hardship, and individual triumph. Advance press focused almost myopically on the lead performance, overshadowing the movie as a whole. This is a little unfortunate, because much to my very pleasant delight, 'Spencer' is utterly terrific, through and through.The fantastical slant is quickly emphasized with sweeping views of an opulent estate, the stately escort of cooking ingredients by soldiers, a highly regimented kitchen staff, and a bizarre holiday weighing ritual. We're just as quickly greeted by director Pablo Larrain's careful arrangement of scenes, including wide shots accentuating the grandeur. Composer Jonny Greenwood's dynamic, adaptive score immediately tickles our ears with tantalizing chords; tones are at times playful, dour, discordant, regal, or simply keenly dramatic. With these changes the music lends a measure of atmosphere as it portends intrigue, sorrow, building pressure, or a certain sense of dehumanization.The costume design is absolutely outstanding, and all commendations as well to the hair and makeup crew for their fabulous contributions. Painstaking consideration for details like these ensure the cast looks great, and the picture is ever more vivid and real for the audience. Set design and decoration is momentous, and even the sound design received unexpected attention. From a technical standpoint, this is airtight.In a film like this, though, it's the content that matters most. I am truly pleased - positively gratified - that where it counts the most, 'Spencer' is an outright joy: Larrain's direction and writer Steven Knight's screenplay are both exceptional. The characterization of Diana is searingly intense and complex, and if other characters are less so, it's only because they're not the protagonist. Dialogue is sharp and biting, scene writing is phenomenal, and the overall narrative is smart, very thoughtfully considered, and deeply absorbing. The plot is very character-driven as it relates the mentally taxing, emotionally charged turbulence within a beloved figure's life, and it's fascinating to watch unfold. Moreover, the film is rife with bounteous thematic content, vigorously exploring ideas including and not limited to identity, tradition and history, undue scrutiny, expected self sacrifice, appearance and perception - and esoteric notions of where the past belongs, what the present is, and what the future could be. As much as I've already discussed Larrain's guiding hand and fine eye as director, it's very much worth further noting phenomenal shot composition, camerawork, and orchestration of scenes. Once again: Larrain and Knight's tandem labor was very, very fruitful.And then of course there are the performances. The supporting cast are all first-rate as they inhabit their roles, but special mention must be made for a couple in particular. Sally Hawkins is wonderfully warm and sweet as royal dresser Maggie, Diana's friend and confidant - bringing the same disarming earnestness to the part as she did to Elisa in 'The shape of water.' And Timothy Spall, ever reliable in his excellence, is duly mysterious and low-key disquieting as Alistair - a looming, watchful specter, a keeper of tradition and propriety. Alistair almost isn't so much a character as he is the living avatar of unmoved personal enforcement and regulation, and Spall is distinctively impressive in that capacity, with admirable presence.That just leaves the number one question on everyone's lips, the center of all the media attention on 'Spencer' and the greatest wild card of all: How is Kristen Stewart's lead performance?I can't speak to the accuracy of the portrayal in terms of exactly how much Stewart mirrors the late Princess of Wales; I'm certainly old enough to remember Diana as a public figure, but I was never so attuned to celebrity news as to have a real sense of her person. What I can say is that, considered in and of itself, Stewart's performance is exemplary. Her adopted accent, her manner of speech, and her comportment are all but otherworldly. At some points I scarcely recognized the individual before my eyes as Kristen Stewart, because she immersed herself in the role so completely. Hers is an exquisite, meticulous, particular, practiced, and carefully crafted depiction; every minute gesture, micro-expression, and gaze comes across as fastidiously prepared with utmost intent. Stewart illustrates the poise, force of personality, nuance, range, and physicality to mark her as a world-class actress. Past follies aside (who hasn't made bad movies?), we already knew this of her, if nothing else owing to her deservedly award-winning display in 'Clouds of Sils Maria.' But I very honestly hope that Stewart's turn in 'Spencer' concretely shifts the conversation surrounding her from dubious genre flick romance to strikingly skilled young powerhouse with diverse capabilities: Is all that Oscar talk for Stewart really up to snuff? Yes. Yes, it absolutely is.If I have any critique to make, it would be that the last length of the film falters ever so slightly in its step. There comes a point - a very discrete point in the runtime, nearer the end - when the tone of the feature shifts drastically. If the majority of these two hours leaned mightily into the psychological drama of the story, mixed with tinges of fantastical highlights, then the last fraction rather abruptly drops the former element, wholly changing the feel of the picture before us. At first blush I was so taken aback that my regard immediately dropped. And yet: from a narrative standpoint, that shift is totally accounted for. The plot as written has reached its critical juncture - and with the bent of the feature as it is, that about-face, however initially off-putting, makes sense. Kudos to Knight and Larrain once more.It's sometimes heavy-handed, and sometimes ham-handed. Mostly it's precise, and perfect - but always very deliberate, and diligent. For all that - nonetheless, I won't begrudge anyone who engages honestly with 'Spencer' and finds it not to their liking. Putting aside fundamental difference of opinion, there are a lot of ways in which this could be a turn-off for some viewers. Above all, I think the flavor of the feature as a psychological drama is probably geared for a more niche audience, and maybe even more than that - to employ this approach with regards to individuals of recent history, with fictionalized versions of those both living and dead, may understandably be upsetting to some. Still, with some exceptions, I have a hard time believing that most impartial moviegoers watching 'Spencer' wouldn't recognize the magnificent skill in all aspects of its creation, even if it's not quite up their alley. Doubly so for Stewart, here giving the performance of a lifetime, who so often unfairly seems to be a punching bag where her many other 'Twilight' co-stars are not.Loquacious as I have been, I yet feel as though I'm not effectively communicating my extreme enthusiasm for this movie, but I could easily go on for far longer and start writing in circles. At great length, suffice it to say that I was ever so curious about the hype when I sat to watch, and even already being a fan of Kristen Stewart, I'm blown away. This film could easily have been a maudlin mess, or Oscar bait with a single worthy trait. Instead it squarely goes against the grain of the type of features that commonly become dears of Hollywood decision-makers, soundly proving the substantial abilities of all involved while telling a compelling, engrossing, thought-provoking, satisfying, and rewarding story. I'm more ecstatic than I can rightly express - 'Spencer' is a sensational, breathtaking, fulfilling cinematic experience that I can't wait to watch again, and it gets my very highest recommendation.Bravo!",Spencer

974,15,mossgrymk,spencer,9/10,28 November 2021,"Much like Pablo Larrain's previous look at a woman trapped in a dynastic cult, ""Jackie"", only better because it features a sharper, wittier and more perceptive screenplay by Steve Knight and a truly towering performance by Kristen Stewart. In these days when Brits and Aussies play Yanks with annoying regularity, as if American culture cannot be safely entrusted to American actors, it is extremely satisfying to see perhaps the most iconic Brit of the 20th cent (Churchill fans'll disagree, but to hell with them) outsourced to a gal from LA who, within the space of five minutes, if not sooner, completely disappears into the angry, bewildered, shy, cheeky, and vulnerable body of the title character. If Ms. Stewart does not walk away with the Oscar it will only be because the academy once again drops the friggin ball. Ably assisting Ms. Stewart is the usual assemblage of fine Brit acting led, in my opinion, by Timothy Spall and Sally Hawkins (shades of Mike Leigh here) playing, respectively, the voice of English reverence toward the monarchy and the voice of English admiration for the genuine person lost amid the expensive detritus of the House Of Windsor (didya catch that shower and those cool as hell Barbour jackets?) Also worthy of commendation are Sean Harris as the royal head chef whose reaction to Diana is best described as sympathetically amused, and Jack Farthing as a properly cold but not completely horrible Prince of Wales. Rounding out the encomiums are Claire Mathon's cinematography, coldly, regally beautiful as befits its setting, and Stefan Speth's art direction that turns a German country mansion into stuffy, smothering Sandringham, which cannot have been an easy task.Any criticisms? Yeah, three. I wish there had been more about why Diana loved and cherished the memory of her dad, I could have done without the Anne Boleyn stuff which was as ham handed as most of the rest of the film was restrained, and I agree with the previous reviewer about the sucky, intrusive, jazz/classical score that is, like a heavy Windsor dinner, always with you.Give it an A minus.",Spencer

976,17,bob-the-movie-man,Diana hits rock bottom... as does the script,4/10,10 November 2021,"Discordant strings sound as the royal party arrives at Sandringham for Christmas. ""Is she here yet"" intones the Queen. ""No ma'am"" her major domo replies. ""Then she's late"". Cut to a soulful choral version of ""Perfect Day"" as Diana Princess of Wales (née Spencer) arrives via a dramatic aerial shot. Hugs go to her sons William and Harry before she unhappily stalks through the corridors like a hunted animal. So begins the trailer for ""Spencer"", and it looked great. But, oh dear! It comes to something where the very best thing about the film is the trailer. For, unfortunately for me, this came across as pretentious, vaguely insulting and with a dreadful script.Positives:
Kristen Stewart does a simply fabulous job of impersonating Diana. She's clearly studied a lot of video of the lady in getting to mimic the way she looks, walks and dances. Although I didn't rate the film, the performance is a cut-above.Negatives:
Oh man, Steven Knight's dialogue here I found to be simply atrocious. Head-in-the-hands bad. I decided about half way through this monstrosity that ""The Room"" had had its day as a cult student classic, and that ""Spencer"" should take over in that role! (More in my blog!).The rest of the cast do a good enough job with what they have, but have the general vibe of being embarrassed to deliver the dialogue they've been given. Sean Harris - a fine actor - inexplicably spouts Shakespeare like Christopher Plummer in ""Star Trek VI""! And one can only assume that Timothy Spall was given direction to act as if he had a whole lemon stuck inside his mouth for the whole movie.I've been a fan of Jonny Greenwood's music in other movies like ""Phantom Thread"". I've seen Mark Kermode describe this soundtrack as ""fantastic"". But, for me, the intrusive atonal strings and laid-back jazz vibe just didn't work for me at all.Summary Thoughts on ""Spencer"": As you can probably tell, I hated this one. And the illustrious Mrs Movie Man 100% agrees with me in this assessment. The trailer promised a lot, but the movie delivered very little for me. It just all felt to me like an affront to the memory of Diana. Making a highly fictitious ""fable based on a real life tragedy"" just feels wrong. This seems particularly the case when the Queen, Prince Charles and (particularly) William and Harry are alive to watch it. What must they think if and when they get to view this?I was a big fan of Larrain's 2017 biopic on Jackie Kennedy - ""Jackie"" - which really covered the very similar ground, of a lady in the focus of publicity struggling with mental illness. But at least that had the benefit of historical distance.I seem to be swimming against the critical tide here, since the movie currently has an IMDB rating of 7.4/10. But frankly, for me, I thought the recent series of ""The Crown"" did this so much better.(For the full graphical and video versions of this review, check out #onemannsmovies online.

Not only did she look like a goddess, she also showed incredible amount of emotions that her character tried so hard to suppress to conform with the royal family. If you think she's a bad actress, think again.The movie also used series of hallucinations of one of the wives of King Henry VIII, who had similar situation to Diana. It's an amazing way to show development of the character and also add more surrealism into the movie. Because of this, the ending was both satisfying and empowering.Overall, a breathtakingly beautiful and intense movie where Stewart showed her best form. 9.5/10.",Spencer
978,19,msbreviews,Spencer is one of those rare examples where going into it completely blind didn't work in my favor at all.,6/10,5 November 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""I knew absolutely nothing about this movie beforehand. I heard/read extraordinarily positive reactions that definitely elevated my expectations. And my actual knowledge about Princess Diana and her life was and still is extremely basic. Spencer is one of those rare examples where going into it completely blind didn't work in my favor at all. I found myself trying to look for something to grab on to, and despite some genuinely outstanding technical attributes, Steven Knight's (Locked Down) screenplay doesn't offer me enough to hold my attention.Spencer is undoubtedly a fictional character piece that only stands on its feet due to one of the year's most mesmerizing lead performances. Kristen Stewart (Underwater), an actress who still gets a lot of unfair hate despite her clear evolution to one of the most underrated actors working today, delivers a career-defining portrayal of Princess Diana that viewers will hardly forget about. I can't recall the last time I witnessed an actor completely disappearing into their role. A true masterclass worthy of every single award. The rest of the cast is also superb.Technically, I also have little to complain about. Pablo Larraín's (Jackie) distinct direction adequately fits the frustrating, claustrophobic story, and I love how Claire Mathon's (Portrait of a Lady on Fire) moves between the intimate close-ups and gorgeous wide shots. As expected, costume and production design look fabulous, but Jonny Greenwood's (You Were Never Really Here) score didn't work for me. The mix of jazz with high-tension sequences becomes too uncanny, distracting the viewers from the narrative, which leads me to my main issue.For someone with my knowledge and expectations, Spencer becomes one of those ""nothing happens"" films that usually surprises viewers with its unique storytelling approach. I'm all-in for this type of work, but outside of Stewart's display, I struggled to feel captivated by whatever was going on. A supposedly consistently interesting character study transformed into an overlong, repetitive one-woman show, where I couldn't figure out what it was aiming for. I understand the purpose of making the audience feel how Diana felt during her marriage and living within British Royalty, but Larraín's execution somehow fails to leave me emotionally satisfied.A second viewing will probably improve and strengthen my opinion about the movie. For now, I feel very mixed about Spencer, but I'll leave this as a positive review trusting that I'll gradually enjoy it more after each viewing.""Rating: B-",Spencer
979,20,meydiana-65242,What an incredibly haunting and beautiful movie.,10/10,27 November 2021,"I believe that many people were, unfortunately, expecting a biopic. However, it is clear that this film takes place throughout 3 days in Christmas (Prior to Diana's separation from Charles). Kristen Stewart portrayed Diana wonderfully during her lowest moments, all the way through her catharsis in the end (all the while showing what a caring and loving mother she was). The writers also did an amazing job showing the lack of empathy and double standard that comes with a royal title. This was not a movie about the royal family; this was about Diana and the private humiliation she had to endure, in addition to the temporary psychosis she may have experienced due to her 10+ year eating disorder. The cinematography was breathtaking and I would gladly recommend Spencer to anyone. Watch it without prejudice and appreciate the time and effort that went into this amazing project.

980,21,lareval,Kristen Stewart can really act and soar,9/10,21 November 2021,"I only liked her in a couple of roles because I've thought she put the same face and same gesture all the time (plus some movies like 'Charlie's Angels' didn't help). But good lord: this is her best role and her best performance ever. The voice, the manners, the body language, her face... For the first time in her career, she disappeared into Diana's role (in my humble opinion). Her lavish central role helps this movie to actually keep me on the edge of my seat. It's a slow burner that hypnotizes me from the very start with a gourgeous photography and locations, plus a direction and a camera that follow Diana on a very eerie fashion. Tender moments allow us to breathe in between thrilling and disturbing ones featuring her about to break in tears and collapse. It is going to be kind of divisive, but I absolutely adored this heartbreaking film. A must see!

981,22,statuskuo,Princess Prison,7/10,12 November 2021,"Imagine being at a dinner with your in-laws for 10 straight years. I mean the meal lasts that long. You'd want to claw at the walls to escape.Every woman and girl I grew up with were mesmerized by Lady Diana. At a time when there were no social media or internet the press hammered down her importance. To me, royalty has always been sad. And it was tough to convince people all that wealth, riches and fame seemed to be...cursed. Yes, even when I was a teen I knew something was up, since Diana typically looked miserable. You could chalk that up to British stoicism. But something about the way Diana conducted herself seemed unnatural. Perhaps it was her borderline personality disorder. The vulnerable qualities that permeated her actions. Friendly and loving but sometimes mean as a scorpion. There was no love lost between her and Prince Charles. To me, they all seemed phony.As an American, made moreso since they meant very little in terms of monarchy controlling state interest..or perhaps it was because I was a dude.Kristen Stewart nails it perfectly. So much so you want to shake this woman into reality. But 10 years of marriage to Charlie probably resulted in this captive feel. And director Pablo Laraine captures this decline of freedom well.This movie is clearly not for everyone. It is a mood piece. A horror film of sorts. Framing a lot of it the way Stanley Kubrick may have done it. It is clear ""The Shining"" was an influence. The castle even looks like The Overlook. And so it isn't surprising when Diana starts to see ghosts and reimagine herself as Anne Boylen.I think it wasn't that big of a step for Stewart to take to this role since celebrity seems to share the same burden. That of an outward appearance battling it out with an inward reality. It's hard to tell what Diana really wanted except to be a human being. But, as a princess, the weight of purpose versus being catered to would function say...if that is all you knew.This is a haunting film, as the atmosphere of faceless, joyless royalty conduct themselves as passing spirits.There is nothing groundbreaking here. But still has enough solid performances to get you through a frosty family get together.",Spencer
982,23,PedroPires90,"Surprise, surprise...this is just ok",5/10,25 November 2021,"Mostly disagree with critics: this is technically very good but, as a film, just meh (and I will probably change the rating between 5 and 6 stars more times). The film is artsy, which usually means a 50/50 situation to me: very good or very painful and pretentious. This is a bit on the middle. There is a very strong and powerful scene around 40 minutes - and it's an hallucination...- but it's a shame that, after that, this turned to be much less interesting and repetitive until we have Diana visiting her old house (definitely, the highlight of the film, technically and emotionally). It's ok most of the time, some meaningful - and totally predictable - conversations, with, unfortunately, no subtlety at all. It has an interesting score and is well directed, but...it should be so much more than these two hours of the same. Can anyone tell me that this would be any different if it was a 60 minutes film? There is no arc, there is no grow, nothing new, the characters end exactly like they started, most - except Diana and Maggie played very well by Sally Hawkins - totally unidimensional, like MCU villains. I liked the suffocating elements that we saw before in films like Birdman or Shiva Baby, but I think the tone is an issue here, as we keep the same and the same mood for the entire 2 hours (except the KFC trip).Even more surprisingly, I don't think KStew performance is really Oscar worthy (but she will probably win). Don't get me wrong: she does a good job. I just think I would enjoy it much more if I didn't know the real Diana. I never, never, never saw Diana here. I always saw Stewart trying to act like Diana. Some of the things she does are obviously very well taken from Diana - like inclining her head to the side when she speaks or some eye movements - as expected, she can also play very well with what is emotionally requested (even if not as convincing as Jessica Chastain or Tessa Thompson in other films this year, I felt more like someone acting than a real person here). I just didn't feel her character that close to the real Diana, with some clear exaggerations (why always whispering? Diana had a sweet and calm voice but she was not whispering all the time...also forget that ""perfect accent"" that some are talking about).In short, I think this is as good as weak: there are beautiful technical elements, Stewart acting is strong (even if it worked much better if it was about a fictional character), you can feel the tension and anxiety growing up, but...I can't avoid to think of this as an Oscar-bait (not in the way of appealing to mainstream audiences, but critics and connoisseurs - who play a big part nowadays) and disappointing, as it thinks it has a lot to say but it just keeps playing with the same elements over and over again, being completely one-note, repetitive and even patronising (do we really need all that expository dialogue to explain the same over and over again?).",Spencer
983,24,Spanner-2,Good performances enliven slow film,5/10,14 November 2021,"Kristen Stewart stars as Diana in this story which covers one weekend at the end of her marriage where she has to deal with Christmas with the royal family.. The film is slowly paced, which makes it at times kinda dull but the production values are very good and Stewart is terrific in the role... you never really get to know the other royals, and most of her interactions are with the household staff... other than a few fun scenes where she is with her sons.

984,25,sweidman-28016,"A Masterclass in Story, Direction, Acting, and Everything Else",9/10,18 November 2021,"""Here, in this house, there is no future. Past and the present are the same thing.""I'm very late on this but I have free time now!During her Christmas holidays with the royal family at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer, struggling with mental health problems, decides to end her decade-long marriage to Prince Charles. At the beginning of Spencer, we're told this is a fable from a tragic tale. Though we may not know the full story from those three days, what Spencer manages to do is extraordinary. This film is brilliant from start to finish. Diana's story has become increasingly popular within the past few years, especially with season four of The Crown. Some may be getting fatigued from the story, but I am not. We haven't seen anything like this just yet. Steven Knight hasn't written something as grand as this before. It's a piercing screenplay that digs right to the core and guts you out. Pained, serene, and ever so heartbreaking, it's a roller coaster of emotions. Believe it or not, this is a pretty bizarre film as well. The lavish lifestyle and the activities and expectations that encompass the holidays may feel foreign to most (I would hope so), but it turns into a haunting story as it crosses between reality and surrealism. Though fairly easy to follow, we can't be for certain what's real and not in a few scenes. In a few sections, it does run a bit in circles and repeats the same things. Shortly, they pick up and go back on track. Pablo Larraín was a master when it came to 2016's biopic Jackie. Here, he's even more of a revelation. Beautifully directed, his voice stands out. There are many visions that come clear through his direction that no one else would have dared to seek out. It seems that he's very interested in heavy-handed, character-driven biopics, so far about female figures, and I cannot wait to see what he might do next if he continues this route. Even if that's not the plan, anything else I'd love to see.Outshining the direction is Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Diana. This is absolutely incredible. We know about Twilight and all those roles she had during that phase which didn't go over very well, mainly due to the movies she was attached to. You cannot say she's a bad actress because there are many roles of hers that she is very good in. Absolutely this is her best work! She nails the accent and all of the little mannerisms. Because of how intimate it is, we are completely in her shoes. We see the full range of emotions. Though the dramatic monologues drew me in (and literally everything), my favorite parts came from her with the kids. You see the light inside of her shine through and it's a wholesome few minutes. Truly a transformative performance that is completely captivating. Even the smaller performances from Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins, and Sean Harris are very good. Look plays a big part in the story in film. The costumes, as beautiful as they are, become an antagonist for Diana and us. The set design is very extravagant but becomes a dizzying maze from how excessive it is to the common eye. The most striking part is the cinematography. Claire Mathon outdoes herself with the dreamy look that puts us in a new world. You can tell it's all done on film and I wish we had more films that look like this, however, only Mathon could do what she did. Another interesting aspect is Jonny Greenwood's score. It's unconventional for this type of film. It turns into something avant-garde and jazzy. I don't know how he pulled it off, but it's memorable is very good. There's so much I could say about Spencer and praise it for. It's one of the best films of the year and it's because of the dedication to Diana's memory that pulls it together. If you get the chance it see this, please do. It's rewarding in every way possible.",Spencer
985,26,markgorman,The best p[sychological horror film I've seen in ages: #TheShining,8/10,16 November 2021,"It's a horror movie, not a historical drama.It's The Shining for our Royal Family. A family that don't come out of this well.Now, I should say, this is a work of fiction, but anyone with half a brain that lived through those times in Britain and sees what is happening to Diana's sons (one Charles', one Hewitts') will know that this is really the truth.It's set over three days at Sandringham, my that's a pad. In which Diana, at the height of her tortured bulimia, despises the royal family, herself, and their hideous traditions that involve killing animals and killing commoners.Of course, she was never a commoner, but she was just a sort of ordinary girl and that is what I think the remarkable direction of Pablo Larrain (Jackie) captures.The direction is magnificent with his weird horror tropes, fantasy segments and an ability to walk away for long segments of the film from straight narrative.Again, I say, it is a modern day The Shining, made horrifying by Jonny Greenwood's hideous score. Deafening and discordant at times, fusing jazz and classical, it is not singalong, but it it truly brilliant.But now, let's focus on Kristen Stewart. Her first Oscar nomination surely in the bag. She's a brave method actor, always has been, and I admire her for this immensely.Timothy Spall is superb and so are the two commoners that Stewart makes a relationship with - her Dresser, Maggie (a brilliant cameo by Sally Hawkins) and the chef Darren (Sean Harris, so sympathetic, so lovely). These two keep Diana alive.The genius of the casting is to make none of the Royal family characters (including Charles) matter. This isn't about these horrible people. They ARE the enemy, the reason for Diana's illness, bulimia, self harming, but Larraín chooses to make them incidental scum and I love that choice he made.The exception being William and Harry who are the only other reasons Diana survives the movie. You can see now why Hewitt's son, Harry, has distanced himself from this evil institution, and good on him.This is high quality art house cinema. Not for your Aunty Mavis, but I loved it.",Spencer
986,27,movieman6-413-929510,The dark tragic side of royal life where the fable sides were not needed.,5/10,18 November 2021,"Spencer is a fantasy version of a biography of Princess Diana. The film is directed by Pablo Larrain, who also directed the Jackie Kennedy biography.The film follows Princess Diana (Kristen Stewart) during the Christmas holidays. Thanks to the many rumors around the British royal family, where the world assumes that Diana and Prince Charles have relationship problems, Diana is under extra pressure. She is widely followed by the press as she tries to prepare for the British royal Christmas celebration. As a result, she gradually begins to struggle with psychological problems.With this film they show the dark side of royal life well. Despite the fact that this life in fairy tales comes across as a great and rich life. In reality, the royal life has been much harder. Royal people are often followed by the press, which means that they have almost no privacy left. They also have to adhere to strict rules, such as the way in which they are allowed to eat. Despite being presented with a royal menu, they are only allowed to take a little of it. They also have to adhere to certain dress styles. Thus, the film conveys well how suffocating royal life can be.They bring out these dark sides of royal life well, but unfortunately chose to do this more in a fictional way. Putting it this way can make it seem a bit exaggerated. The fiction hadn't been necessary, because Princess Diana lived quite a special and intense life in real life. Because of the fictional sides, the film can sometimes come across as a bit unusual. Without the fantasy sides of this film they could have made a more realistic film.What comes out well in this film are the clothes, make-up and hairstyles of the film cast, especially Princess Diana. This is what she was really known for. Unfortunately, they don't really bring out well-known styles of the real Princess Diana in the film.Kristen Stewart delivers good and fitting acting in the film. With her own acting career, she knows the feeling of being followed by fans and the press. Sally Hawkins also does a good job of playing someone from her ministry who she really likes among all the other royals,",Spencer
987,28,themadmovieman,A haunted house,9/10,8 November 2021,"One of the most mesmerising films you'll ever see, Spencer is an intoxicating psychodrama from start to finish, combining a brilliant lead performance from Kristen Stewart with spellbinding direction from Pablo Larraín, an exhilarating musical score, powerfully claustrophobic cinematography and an enthralling, thematically rich adaptation of the famous life of Diana, Princess of Wales.I was absolutely floored by Spencer, which is on the same level as Larraín's masterful Jackie in terms of its dramatic intensity and power. However, it's important to know going in that Spencer isn't a film there to give you a historical account of one Christmas that Diana spent with the in-laws.This isn't a factual biopic, but rather a 'fable from a true tragedy' as the film calls it at the beginning. The setting at Christmas at Sandringham simply serves as a canvas onto which we see the main themes of Diana's life in the Royal Family painted out in abstract, imaginative and powerfully enthralling fashion.So, don't go in expecting pure historical fact, but do go in expecting one of the most uncomfortable, intense dramatic experiences you're ever likely to have. Spencer almost takes things up a level from Jackie, going beyond overwhelming grief into a realm of near-madness, as we witness Diana driven to the verge of breaking down by the obtuse world in which she finds herself.Throughout, the Sandringham Estate is painted as a kind of haunted house, shrouded in mist and full of eerie corridors where you almost never encounter the hosts of an infuriating Christmas. Coupled with the film's intoxicating, claustrophobic cinematography and one of the most unsettling musical scores I have ever heard, it's remarkable just how much Spencer feels like a true nightmare, like The Shining come to life.And I'll say it again - this is why you can't watch this film as a typical biopic. Its overarching themes are certainly based in historical truth, but are moulded and adapted to fit into a brilliantly concise portrayal of some of the main anxieties that surrounded Diana at the height of her Royal fame.The screenplay here is particularly sparing with dialogue, almost all of which uttered in breathy, timid whispers, as director Pablo Larraín leaves much of the film's drama to be inferred from the exhilarating, ominous haunted house atmosphere, and the hypnotic lead performance from Kristen Stewart.While there are moments where Stewart's performance borders on showy, this is actually a very measured and very powerful performance that demands immense physicality from the actress, as she portrays Diana descending into a kind of madness, surrounded by repetitive, frustrating events that feel like a nightmare.Much like Natalie Portman's performance as Jackie Kennedy, Stewart is full of intense emotion at every minute here, with facial expressions and a demeanour that resonate far more powerfully than any single line of dialogue. It's not exactly what you would call the most historically accurate portrayal of Diana, but it's a gripping, imaginative and bold amalgamation of many of her defining traits.And with that, Spencer delivers exhilarating, intoxicating psychodrama of the highest order from start to finish. There may be a few moments in which the film's allusions to the length and breadth of British royal history are a little on the nose, but this is an expertly-crafted film that certainly doesn't hold back at any moment.Intense, uncomfortable, and downright maddening at times, Spencer is a uniquely mesmerising vision of a troubled part of British royal history, featuring a staggering lead performance, ingenious direction, incredible music, spellbinding visuals and a masterful screenplay from start to finish.",Spencer
988,29,coombsstephen,Ridiculous and a dreadful waste of a great opportunity,4/10,22 November 2021,"Such a let down, the film has the cast, sets and budget to really document a recent period of history that had the whole country captivated but wastes it all making an awful arty type film. Also so much of the film would just not have happened in real life, is not even a slight exaggeration, it's just plain ridiculous.As for the annoying mood music that is played over and over during the film, it is probably the closest I have ever been to walking out of a film just because of irritating music. The film would have been a lot better if they just hadn't used it!A decent film on this subject matter could have been a real hit, let's hope for the future.

990,31,darkreignn,"""Spencer"" features an interesting concept with a fantastic main performance",9/10,14 November 2021,"In ""Spencer,"" director Pablo Larraín draws viewers into a fantasy world that is as haunting as it is beautiful - the film has a hazy, dreamlike aura about it that immediately enchants. Almost ethereal in its sights and sounds, the movie makes it easy for viewers to slip into a world that, on the surface, should be full of luxury. All that glitters isn't gold, however, and Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Princess Diana demonstrates that, sometimes, more money really does lead to more problems.I am a huge fan of Kristen Stewart; both talented and gorgeous, I find her to be very underrated. In ""Spencer,"" she gives what is probably the best performance of her career as of this time - she was so great as Princess Diana, playing someone who clearly doesn't want the glitz and glamour that the royal lifestyle promises. Foregoing emotional outbursts, Kristen plays Diana more subdued than you may expect without making it hard to see how depressed she really is. Practically from the opening of the movie, Kristen's Diana looks as if she is about to burst into tears; in other scenes, her anxiety is so strong that she delays her tasks simply because she cannot fathom to be in the same room as the people who she seemingly hates. It's not hidden how unhappy this character is, and Kristen's teary-eyed performance has the possibility to get old fast - however, in my opinion, I found both her performance and the overall concept enthralling.Taking place over the span of three days, ""Spencer"" puts Diana into a multitude of different scenarios and lets viewers simply sit back and watch both her reaction to them, and the reaction of those around her. From seeing Diana deliberately choose the wrong dress to a Christmas mass, or watching her attempt to sneak in some food when the midnight cravings hit, the seemingly mundane becomes interesting because it is all under the shadow of an all seeing, all hearing family who so desperately want to control every move Diana makes. The theme of the day seems to be conform or die as what should be a life of luxury turns into a hostile, choking atmosphere - all because Diana wants a life that is not constantly under the eyes of both family and press.Make no mistake, this story isn't glamorous; if you haven't guessed it already, it's actually quite depressing. ""Spencer"" covers themes of self harm, mental illness, adultery, and more - in the hands of a less competent filmmaker, this could've turned into tragedy porn. However, Kristen's performance elevates the material and creates a film that is truly a study about a woman who is consistently thrown into uncomfortable, undesirable situations. It's not exactly fun viewing, but it's extremely intriguing.",Spencer

993,34,PetarNeo,Kristen saves it a lot,7/10,30 November 2021,"Another movie we knew we don't need but are going to see it anyways because it's about famous person and it has those ""Oscar vibes"". It's a story about how bad royals actually are some people are gonna hate it, some defend it, some love it, but at the end it is about portrayal of royalty but knowing deep down they are not worthy, only egocentric and two-faced.As we follow Diana, wondering around mansion, in all that riches, we start to lose mind together with her. Wanting to be what you really are and not having to pretend but being forced is one tough cookie to swallow and Kristen really did dive into role and is the only thing that will keep you watching and feeling for her, screaming at screen to get out, run, escape.Then we go to production design, from setting to clothes it was immaculate. Effort put into those things is visible like a day, as every dress portrays other feelings and emotions. Location and vastness of space and mansion is beyond reach and it makes you somewhat scared and on the edge of losing mind, and at the same time showing you all riches and treasury that it's got.But you've seen it all before somewhere and it is just casual watching that you will go through and remember only Kristen playing Diana, but forgetting everything else.",Spencer
994,35,nidhunmoviebuff,Kristen Stewart's career best performance!,8/10,30 November 2021,"#MovieReview #Spencer #OscarHopeful #KristenStewart #OnlyinTheatresinIndia #AmazonPrimeUS #SpoilerFreeStories about the British Royal family continue to grab the public's attention and when an Academy award winner like Pablo Larrain decided to take up the story of the most beloved royal of our times, this one was sure to be a crowd puller. 'Spencer' is not a biopic and never strives to be one, focusing instead on a handful of days in the life of Princess Diana and how a consistently negative and judgmental environment can break down the sanity and the sheer life force of even the most well-balances individuals.Kristen Stewart is riveting as the eponymous Diana 'Spencer' aka the Princess of Wales, as we catch her just after her discovery that her husband Prince Charles is still madly in love with his former paramour Camilla. Hounded by a royal family hell bent on sticking to their public image, Diana's individuality and joie-de-vivre is continuously stifled by orderlies and maids, some of whom even pretending to be her friends, just to keep a watch!Kristen Stewart delivers the best version of Princess Diana we have seen in cinema, superseding Naomi Watts in the disastrous Diana (2013) and dare I say, even the excellent Emma Corrin from the Netflix series, Crown. The Twilight trilogy's ignominy has tided over the fact that she is a gifted actress for long and hopefully 'Spencer' acts as a turning point for her.In a career best performance after Clouds of Sils Maria (2014) and Certain Women (2016), Stewart instantly makes us into the character's vulnerability and desperation to hold on to her mental balance as her personal life falls into pieces before us. The much-heralded royals helplessness at her predicaments and the spiraling cesspool that is the Royal family is portrayed in awe-inspiring detail, with the director smartly using even historical allegories to smoothly get the message across.Stella Gonet and Jack Farthing are intimidating and ooze menace in short but impactful performances as the Queen and Prince Charles respectively, communicating the utter disdain they had for Diana will just their eyes and body language. But it is the manservant Timothy Spall that shines among the supporting characters, with a fearsome portrayal of the Master of the Royal Household, David Walker.Sally Hawkins is predictably on point with her poignant take on Diana's chambermaid, delivering her most impactful performance after the Oscar winner, Shape of Water (2017). Sean Harris breaks the villain mould that he was attributed with post the success of the Mission Impossible series, to play the Royal Head Chef, one of Diana's few confidantes.Director Pablo Larrain creates another impactful character study about a woman caught up in a world of media scrutiny and power and privilege she did not ask for, after the terrific Jackie (2016). Kristen Stewart's performance however is more visceral and all-encompassing in the film, therefore standing a notch above Natalie Portman's Jackie Kennedy (wife of JFK) in Jackie.Despite a fluctuating plot that has highs as well as lows, Kristen Stewart's intense performance makes this a must watch. Highly recommended!",Spencer
995,36,rgo23821,Kristen Stewart 10/10,7/10,27 November 2021,"If I had watched this not knowing it starred Kristen Stewart, I would never have guessed it was her. I would have been racking my brain trying to figure out who she was. She is so perfect as Princess Diana, capturing every mannerism and inflection to a tee, and still giving the portrayal so much substance and weight. I thought the actress who played Diana in The Crown was very good too, but would have to watch that again to see whose portrayal is better. Regardless, Stewart has moved herself into a whole other league with this. The film is very good, it's like a poem in a way, very artsy and contemplative. It's all told from Diana's perspective so don't expect a complex, nuanced character study of every person in the film. It's about Diana Spencer.

997,38,js-66130,ROYAL MESS,8/10,19 November 2021,"Surrounded by a trio of English thespian heavyweights (Sally Hawkins, Timothy Spall, Sean Harris), American Kristen Stewart, valiantly sheds the last of her ""Twilight"" past and her L. A. drawl in yet another defining career step as Princess Diana. Quite the feat this.Taking place on the very posh and very cold and very hard grounds of Sandringham, where every polished vase is perfectly in its place, portraits of cruel kings and suffering queens adorn the walls, rooms are vacuous chambers, halls are never ending, the setting is deliciously ominous.The Princess of Wales' endless stream of gowns for every occasion are labelled P. O. W. In a clever nod to the prisoner aspect of a manicured existence. Every move is orchestrated, scrupulously observed, and often harshly, derisively dictated. Captive in an expansive castle and of a cluttered mind over the Christmas holidays, this plays like a hallucinatory, terrifying, Royal version of ""Home Alone"".Stewart is just right as the whispery lead, clutching to what remains of her humanity in a very inhumane circumstance, suffering under insufferable expectation. Yet we all know this bit of herstory, so why movie it?This is not so much about the well known ridiculousness of the Royals, as it is an exploration of the fragile, fighting for sanity and normalcy with nary a hope of achieving either. Stewart's dreamy, distant and childlike persona is quickly disrupted by a series of nightmarish apparitions and self harms, as her Diana stumbles to stay upright and functioning. Tripping through suffocating circumstance of isolation, succumbing to bouts of depression, Diana's journey certainly was not the stuff of fairy tales.Shot with a hazy filter reminiscent of flighty Euro cinema of the eighties, scored with a tension filled beboppy jazz soundtrack referencing the Nouvelle Vague, with meticulously designed set pieces overflowing with ornate embellishments, and paced with extreme military precision, ""Spencer"" is definitely a mood setter; a mood not everyone may care for.hipCRANK.",Spencer
998,39,arabnikita,Now people will finally stop making jokes about Stewart,8/10,7 November 2021,"Spencer (2021)At this point, many of us have heard all sorts of stories about Princess Diana whether we take The Crown or anything else. This begs a question of why should we watch this movie and what new perspective can it bring? Well, first of all the story needs to be told in an unique fashion and this film achieved just that, thanks to the writing of Steven Knight and excellent direction of Pablo Larrain. Together, they managed to craft and artistic canvas which was brought to life by the flawless acting from Kristen Stewart who performs just as well as Diana has performed during her days in the Royal Family.It has been 10 years since Diana has joined the family and the 3 day Christmas weekend with the Royal Family, will finally push her to leave the marriage. Spencer can be categorized into the Arthouse genre due to it's slow and melancholic storytelling that shows the internal and occasionally, psychedelic struggle of Diana. Stewart embraces her role in terms of appearance, mannerisms and speech where every action creates the sense of internal discomfort making her seem deranged to the family while allowing us to feel sympathy for the way she is forced to jump though hoops of tradition in order to fit in. In the middle of the gloomy atmosphere and emotional dialogues she is able to seamlessly shift to the occasional states of motherly joy which adds a human touch to this otherwise sad fable.I can't quite describe it in words but I felt good after exiting the cinema; much like after an art gallery where the paintings create emotions that are strange and yet enjoyable. Despite the fact that the movie focuses on the Royal Family, it has a number of parallels that can be applied to our ordinary lives when it comes to making compromises and trying to fit in. The cinematography, music and costumes are all great but I must warn you that this is an extremely slow movie without much going on so it can easily be perceived as boring or even stationary. However, if you are someone who enjoys melodramatic tales with a potential Oscar winning performance, then Spencer will be to your liking.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Show reviews.",Spencer
999,40,cdjh-81125,Thought Provoking and Emotionally Effective,8/10,18 November 2021,"Movies such as Spencer tend to be hit and miss for me. I just find biopics about iconic real life figures to be a bit overdone and it's become increasingly harder to make them unique from each other. While I think Spencer has some issues in the way it tells it's story, I overall really enjoyed this film and found it to be surprisingly emotional and thought provoking.There were two things that really made me like this movie as much as I did, one of them was Kirsten Stewart. I'm sad to say I've seen very little of her work up until now but I'm going to work to remedy that because she was outstanding in this film. She wonderfully portrayed every aspect of Diana from the persona she has to portray in public to her introverted nature towards the royal family and the few moments she can reveal her true self to her sons and the few people she can trust. She also pulled of the emotional scenes where her character is at her breaking point to perfection and helped me empathise with her and even in some cases relate to her which I wouldn't have thought was possible. While I though the supporting cast all gave great performances (with Sean Harris being a particular standout) no one came close to matching the level of skill she had on display here.The other aspect of the film that I loved was it's depiction of royal life and traditions. It was truly eye opening to see the restrictions upon which the monarchy live and the toll that they take on Diana was expertly portrayed. I was simultaneously frustrated and amazed to see just how scheduled and confining the life of a royal can be and it did actually make me think about other members of the cast beyond Diana and how they may have adapted to the things she struggles with in the film. As someone who has been critical of the institution of the monarchy that is saying something. Beyond the writing I also thought the film looked stunning from a cinematography perspective, it contains the striking visuals that I wish more films of this type had. I thought it was generally well edited and the score was fanatically diverse and unique sounding for a biopic. I expect to see Spencer get a few technical nominations at this years Oscars.As much as I enjoyed Spencer, I don't think it's perfect and my issues mainly come down to some of the ways in which the film depicts it's themes. I found there to be a severe lack of subtlety here with the themes of dehumanisation and individuality being telegraphed from the opening minutes and continued to be brought up in repetitive and obvious ways for much of the first 2 acts. As the film goes into its third act the filmmakers suddenly started using odd stylistic choices to convey Diana's inner conflict and the attempts for the most part came across as jarring to me and took me out of the film in a few parts. I also thought the other royal family members went under used, I understand that this is Diana's story but the fact that she had so little interaction with them felt like something of a missed opportunity to better show her opposition to them and would've perhaps allowed for the themes to be conveyed in a more subtle way.As someone who initially had no interest in this film I was ultimately surprised at how much I enjoyed Spencer. It's phenomenally well acted, I fully expect to Stewart to get an Oscar nomination for her performance, as well as beautifully shot and surprisingly effective in many ways. It may lack subtlety in a few areas but that didn't detract too much from my overall enjoyment. Biopics like this are the ones that peak my interest and hope to get more of them like this in the future.8.2/10 - A- (Fantastic)",Spencer
1000,41,theredsky,Spencer Review,10/10,23 November 2021,"A film that breaks the conventions of a biopic by taking a real person and placing them in a real life event while being abstract and looking at how the person thought instead of how the people around her felt. It's everything I wanted it to be and more. I have to say that Kristen Stewart's performance as Princess Diana is absolutely amazing. It's my favorite performance of the year so far and absolutely deserves the Oscar for Best Actress next year. Stewart is unrecognizable here and I loved that. All of the other performances were great as well especially from Timothy Spall and Sally Hawkins. The costumes are on point here. Each of them helps contribute to Diana's mood and tone of the overall scene which was amazing. The costumes help us understand Diana's mood and what she is thinking without directly telling us. The direction, cinematography, and writing are all amazing as well. Pablo Larraín does an amazing job at showing and not telling us Diana's mood unless it was absolutely necessary and his style contributes greatly to the final product. The writing does a fantastic job at showing us someone who is crumbling under the weight of being a member of the Royal family and feeling the need to just run. The cinematography looks stellar here. It looks like a film that came straight out of the 1990s in a good way. The music has a jazzy feel to it which helps us show the impulsiveness of Diana in this film. I also loved how we get almost dream sequences here where we see how Diana is feeling and what she wants to do. Those scenes feel very uncomfortable at points and it works beautifully. All of these qualities come together beautifully to show us the inside of Diana Spencer. Please go check this out when you can but know it's a much more different kind of biopic.",Spencer

1002,43,rmirchandani,Kristen Stewart gives an enchanting performance as Princess Diana,9/10,26 October 2021,"Spencer is a psychological character study of Princess Diana's tumultuous time as a member of the British royal family. It depicts Princess Diana in a precarious state after finding out about Prince Charles' affair. Although we only see them interact a couple of times, the tension in those moments is felt. Princess Diana wanted to be loved by Prince Charles, but he was in love with someone else.The film showcases Princess Diana's downward spiral with sincerity, accuracy, and pathos. One of the early instances where the viewer drastically feels uneasy is the royal family dinner scene where Princess Diana spirals out of control. The scene fluctuates between Diana's fantasy and the real world. It perfectly encapsulates Diana's anger and immense sadness towards Prince Charles and her nervousness and fear of Queen Elizabeth II.Kristen Stewart 's portrayal of Princess Diana is beguiling. She gives an Oscar worthy performance and manages to portray Princess Diana in a new light. I was in awe and utterly enthralled by her performance. This film really proves Kristen Stewart's versatility as an actress. From the teen drama ""Speak"" (2004) to the Oscar nominated film ""Into the Wild"" (2007) to her Twilight days and then to the divisive ""Charlie's Angels"" reboot, Kristen Stewart is quite a versatile actress with a colourful filmography. It is fair to say that her portrayal of Princess Diana is her most memorable role and career defining. I'll be surprised if she does not at least get an Oscar nomination.Despite an overall heavy and emotionally exhausting film, it still had some humorous moments sprinkled throughout. Especially the ending where Princess Diana takes William and Harry to KFC in London. Sometimes it's good to experience life outside of the monarchy. Princess Diana was known to be a little rebellious, stand-offish, and downright unhinged in the film and in real life. The tabloids and paparazzi were constantly focused on her. It is truly a shame that the paparazzi was the primary catalyst for Princess Diana's car crash in 1997. Paparazzi back then and even now were toxic and don't see the royal family as normal people. At the end of the day, Princess Diana is alike everyone else struggling with deep rooted trauma stemming from her childhood.The non-diegetic music intertwined with Princess Diana experiencing flashbacks to her past and changing to a variety of different dresses is dream-like. Princess Diana is perhaps the most famous historical figure of the 20th century. I was born after Princess Diana's unfortunate passing, so I don't know first-hand how the world reacted. Although I watched countless documentaries about her. It is fair to say though that Princess Diana has been celebrated across the world. That makes Pablo Larraín's film ""Spencer"" one of the best biopics about the British monarchy. With its emphasis solely on Princess Diana aka Lady Spencer the film does an excellent job at showcasing Diana's descent into madness. The director showcased devotion to the project and managed to capture the sheer essence of Princess Diana. He even showcased Princess Diana as carefree, positive, and hopeful in some instances of the film.I love how the film compares Princess Diana's life to the life and death of Anne Boleyn. In many ways, those two women are similar regarding their experiences with men, their role in the monarchy and mental trauma.Claire Mathon really came into her own over the past two years. She was the cinematographer for Celine Sciamma's 2019 film ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" and now for the 2021 prestige films ""Spencer"" and ""Petite Maman.""To conclude, the 2021 film ""Spencer"" directed by Pablo Larraín benefits from its high production value, exuberant mise-en-scene, astounding cinematography, great camera work, perfect casting choices, beautiful early 90s aesthetic and vibrant costumes. I'm grateful that I was able to watch this film at an international film festival before its intended release. Spencer is one of 2021's best films, and my personal favourite so far. It is a brilliant retelling of Princess Diana's tragic story but in its own unique way. The film was a memorable cinematic experience that I'll cherish forever. It fully captivated me from start to finish.* Whoever chose the song ""All I need is a Miracle"" by Mike and the Mechanics is an absolute genius. It served as a positive song to a hopeful ending to an otherwise anxiety inducing, nerve-racking and secluded film.* The film takes place over three consecutive days: Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day.* In the monarchy, the past and present is the same thing. This phrase stuck with me due to its profoundness and double layered meaning.Final verdict: 9.7/10.",Spencer

I have no interest or belief in the royal family, but I always felt sorry for Diana as you could see what the determined outmoded ideas of that institution did to her.

1004,45,BijeshNagesh,Devious & Ingenious,10/10,28 November 2021,"Directed by Pablo Larraín and written for the screen by Steven Knight, ""Spencer"" bloomed from interesting to captivating in ways only good cinema can prove to do so. It was a peek into - not a princess, not a celebrity - but a human being who suffered from personal demons.This movie is not a biopic in the strictest sense of the word, but it showcased a dramatized version of Princess Diana's personal travails and experiences based on very real events and moments. The moments in question revolve around events at Sandringham estate during one of the Christmas holidays when the royals gathered to celebrate as a family.Playing her sons Harry and William were Freddie Spry and Jack Nielen, respectively - both did good work in this film. Portraying Charles was Jack Farthing - he was good in the role. Playing HRM Queen Elizabeth II was Stella Gonet - she was exemplary. Capturing the presence of Prince Philip - who recently passed - was Richard Sammel.Playing Chef Darren was Sean Harris, who was rather amazing. Slipping into the shoes of Major Alistar Gregory was the immensely talented Timothy Spall. Good support came from Sally Hawkins, who played Maggie. Amy Mason as the spectral Anne Boleyn was noteworthy.The real show-stopper performance came from Kristen Stewart. It was breathtaking watching her perform the role that stood at the heart of this project. There was no doubt in my mind that Kristen Stewart would channel the late great Diana Spencer with grace and truth. She gave a candid performance that reflected the very core of who Diana was - including her accent and voice.In my eyes, Kristen was not Diana per se but the princess's soul - itching to get out, clawing to be free of royal rigours, scrambling to escape her own family's haughty judgement. The way Pablo captured Diana's silent pleas for help regarding her state of mind and her anorexia were stunning and depthful.Claire Mathon's cinematography was enlivening. Jonny Greenwood's musical scoring was superb. Sebastián Sepúlveda's editing deserves special mention. Guy Hendrix Dyas's production design complemented Yesim Zolan's set decoration, and Ralf Schreck and Stefan Speth's art direction.The hair and makeup department did great work on this film. So did the special effects team and sound crews. As for Jacqueline Durran's costume design, I believe there's an award waiting in the wings somewhere for her masterful contribution to ""Spencer"".Symbolic, powerful, and elegantly dramatized, anyone who has heard of Diana's legacy, scandals, and sheer will to be herself - and who have come to adore and admire the 'People's Princess' - will genuinely appreciate what Pablo Larraín has done in this movie, which I believe is cinema gold.",Spencer

But her turn as Princess Diana is extraordinary. She plays it carefully and her voice and mannerisms occasionally made me forget it was her playing the part. It's a very interesting tale called a fable of a true tragedy at the beginning. However we who loved and respected the tragic Princess are glad to see her represented in a film in a positive way. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it. I hope the Academy gives Kristen Stewart a chance with a nomination for Best Actress next Spring.

1008,49,chris_rowe-881-168820,Don't believe the fake positivity,1/10,15 November 2021,"This film is garbage, it'll get mistakenly called artsy and daring and showcasing mental health so it'll doubtful avoid much public criticism but as an entertainment piece it is utter rubbish.If true I guess it's sad but it's just another reason that the monarchy are an outdated pointless presence who just enforce that silly posh stereotype and are out of touch with real people. Diana felt like a real person and look what it did to her, I mean the only press they seem to get these days is negative. The only royal with an ounce of real in them left aswell.It's slow, painfully slow, the acting whilst not bad is just idiotic because of whispering and childish dialogue, I thought I'd feel sorry for Diana as that was always my gut thing but this just made me dislike her, I disliked the others more but just found her to be incredibly petulant and childish rather than mentally unwell.It's not a pleasing ending, it's not a film that ever needs revisiting, it must be awful to be will or Harry and see their family shown in such a way. It's just all round a waste of time and money and does nothing of any good.After thousands of films of every genre I'd easily put this in the lowest 1%.

Or did it just look childish and temper tantrum's but because it's an adult it's deep mental health issues? I dunno, as someone who suffers with MH I didn't see much in this that was at all nuanced or realistic, just cheap and shallow.The acting is fine, KS was good but what she had to work with was garbage, it's literally a movie that ends in a KFC , it's all just ridiculous. It's always poor rich people, think the world forgets the plight of ordinary folk. Did she have to stay?Anyway after thousands of movies this is in the bottom 1% it's awful but it'll be pushed as a daring artsy deep masterpiece about someone portraying a national icon, instead of a 2 hour drag about a woman being fed up and going to kfc. It fails to get sympathy and in my view fails at everything.Also the music is the worst in the history of film, whoever scored this needs a hearing test, it's abysmal, it's so so irritating and fails to set any mood or atmosphere.Cant honestly stress how bad this is, I get some highbrow films but trying to pass this off as anything other than an awful movie is people desperate to look intelligent.",Spencer

1011,52,stefstars,Ugh,3/10,29 November 2021,"Given all the glowing reviews this is getting, it's award winnings from the Summer film festivals, and the hype around Kristen Stewart's performance - I really thought I was going to like this one and that everyone else was right. Turns out they were all absolutely wrong and this film was clearly funded by the royal family in some way.From the beginning of the film, they make it clear that it's a ""fabled"" version of a true tragedy and that's the only justice they will do to Diana as the film goes on. It's one, long, pretentious, self aggrandizing project that is very hard to watch for anyone who has any sense of what makes a good film... well... good. Don't get me wrong, it has some good shots in it, like around the beginning when Diana is driving into the holiday estate. Timothy Spall (as usual) delivers a fantastic performance. If anyone should get an Oscar nod from this, it should be the cinematographer and Timothy Spall.Kristen Stewart on the other hand, awful. I'm not someone who bashes her constantly over the Twilight films, she can do good when needed and she has her flops too. She's a great Joan Jett, but she's no Diana. I have no idea who in the world coached her on becoming Diana. Who in the world told her Diana sounded like an English Batman ? The entire time she does this tilt with her head, keeps looking down and this is suppose to be Diana. Not to mention her English accent is really bad. If Kristen Stewart was supposed to be bringing another character to life, I'd commend her for the performance but she was supposed to be Princess Diana. She did not deliver on this performance. This is like a bad parody of Princess Diana, someone's bizarre idea of who Princess Diana was. There's videos out there of this woman, a good amount of the population that was around to witness her when she was alive are still around. Who is this performance suppose to fool ? The hype built around her performance, I'm convinced is a money campaign. Big money is behind the pushing and pushing of this film getting nominated for award seasons, especially when it comes to Stewart's performance.Nothing new is learned in this film about what happened to Diana and what she was going through when she was married to Charles. I love Princess Diana but was this movie really necessary ? It focuses on her very unstable mental health due to the pressures of living with the royal family, being in a false marriage, trying to be a good mother to her kids - everything we've all heard about so many times since Diana passed away. The 1hr and 57 minutes you spend watching this, you could've saved while watching The Crown on Netflix instead. The actress in that show does a better portrayal of Diana and it's straightforward. This takes a whole ""artsy fartsy"" route in telling Diana's story, has Anne Boleyn appear to really hammer in how much of a victim Diana was and how these two very famous women were victims of the royal family. I understand that Diana is one of those historical figures that people adore so much that they overlook her flaws - but let's be real her flaws were nothing to look down on her about. She was human and if she had affairs during her marriage with Charles, good on her. If she had mental breakdowns while living in the public eye under the fist of the royal family - who wouldn't ?! This film kind of tries to paint her in a bad light, like if you should be upset at her over the latter. The way it's written and Kristen Stewart's performance, it really sort of villainizes her and that's how you knew the film is somehow in cahoots with the royals. Image clean up perhaps after the whole Meghan Markle incidents and The Crown revealing what we all knew but they still refuse to acknowledge ?The score is dreary and doom like, there's a long scene where Diana is contemplating suicide but ""make it aRtiStiC."" I'm talking about where she's wearing a black coat over a white dress and she's on a staircase in a dark, gothic like room. Kristen Stewart does her ""interpretive dancing acting"" to show Diana is contemplating suicide and she does this interpretive dancing throughout the film to show Diana sink further and further into madness. As if the awful blonde hair do and her dreadful acting wasn't enough to indicate this. Anne Boleyn's ghost appears in this scene too cos we have to be reminded about how these two women are like totally the same. That scene shamelessly Oscar baits and it's one of the most pretentious scenes I've seen since Nomadland last year. If this year's Academy panel is as inept as last year's then this stupid film might get it's way further making the Oscar award meaningless.I don't recommend this film at all. Do not waste your time. Watch a documentary on Princess Diana, watch The Crown, read a book about her. If you watch it, just watch for Timothy Spall's performance and fast forward everything else.",Spencer
1012,53,brianjohnson-20043,Not for me,2/10,23 November 2021,"Spencer might be an OK film for someone who is alright with glacial pacing, obnoxious music and is already familiar with when this starts or familiar with the Royal family at this point in their lives going-in. I was none-of-the-above and walking out about an hour into the movie. I'd much rather watch the film The Queen or even some of the episodes of The Crown featuring princess Diana than Spencer. I wasn't a major fan of either of those either compared to a lot of people. But at least they were watchable and interesting. Chappaquiddick was also a better movie about a major national figure dealing with turmoil. I FYI have no positive or negative comment on the acting. To me the rest of the movie wouldn't support the best actors doing a terrific job. And to me that makes it irrelevant whether or not the actors are fine.

1013,54,Benslie,Would work better as an original story,7/10,14 November 2021,"For me, the only really big stand out with this movie was Kristen Stewart's performance as Princess Diana. She brought so much to this role and it helped show how vulnerable she was especially at this point in her life. This might not be the most honest and accurate portrayal of Diana's story, more on that later, but at least the audience gets the just of how much pressure she was under because of the royal family. All of the other actors did really well as well. I definitely liked Jack Farthing, who plays Prince Charles, as well in this movie. The costumes in this movie were really well done and you can see all of the detail that went into recreating most of these outfits. One of the downsides to this movie was unfortunately the story for me. Earlier I mentioned how this movie isn't the most accurate and honest portrayal and that's because this movie is mainly fictional when it comes to Diana's story. I feel like if this movie wasn't based around princess Diana that it could've still been interesting as the story itself is an interesting psychological thriller. Some things happened in the story that just made zero sense when trying to think about this as Diana's story. Steven Knight did an excellent job directing this, even with some weird directing choices, though and making the audience feel like there is no escape as well. The cinematography helped with that part with having the outside in much brighter lighting compared to inside the estate where the lighting was much darker. The editing in the movie was confusing at times as it would just cut away randomly or try to connect two scenes that happen at two different points in time. Lastly, the score for this movie was just obnoxious and didn't fit the tone of this movie at all and needed to be turned down. In the end, Spencer is worth checking out just don't think of it as a Princess Diana story.",Spencer
1014,55,yellowmarlin,One-sided and heavy-handed,2/10,29 November 2021,"I'm a big fan of Kristen Stewart's acting ability and I was hoping for a character-driven movie that would showcase her talents. Sadly, this is an overblown melodrama in which almost nothing of any great consequence happens. The Royal Family are reduced to cardboard cutouts sitting meekly at the dining table, terrified into silence by the mere presence of their malevolent matriarch. I've never seen a more unflattering portrayal of the Queen. Charles is a weak-willed bully. Diana is a caricature; every simpering head tilt and demurely downcast expression hammered into place with the same lack of subtlety with which the intrusive score demands you empathise with every emotional beat. Timothy Spall and Sally Hawkins are always watchable, but I was glad when this was over.

Well done to the cast, they all played well. Looking forward for other stories like these. We really need to acknowledge the stories of people who we didn't know much even after the internet era.

1017,58,Mike_O_Dwyer,Tears For The Poor Little Rich People.,5/10,25 November 2021,"The good thing about this film is Kristen Stewart, her take on a fragile and tortured soul being torn apart is what drives the story.There's a fine line between being sympathetically showing mental distress and coming across as whiney, and for the most part Stewart stays on the right side. That said, complaining about which designer outfit has to be worn, and when, doesn't generate much sympathy these days.Harris (kindly), Spall (sneering), Farthing (condescending yet dim), and Hawkins (obsequious) have a few one-note scenes each that add little.Unfortunately this story has been told so many times that everyone has become a caricature, and that is all we get here: awfully rich people trapped in an expensive but dusty bauble and utterly blind to how tired and tiresome they have become.Are they awful because they're trapped in a circus of their own making, being ridiculed or fawned over in equal measure? Or are they awful because they've been born and bred to be spoilt brats with no self awareness.For anyone who looks at the Royals and sees nothing more than highly paid cosplay characters with unfettered egos, there's nothing surprising in Spencer: none of them seem like real people; none of them seem remotely likeable; none of them lead lives that would be desireable.",Spencer
1018,59,monberger,I love this film!!!,10/10,27 November 2021,"Larrain's depiction of Princess Dianna takes place over a few days' holidays with the royal family. It captures Princess Dianna's emotional distress into insanity, knowing that her existing loving relationship with Prince Charles was fated for reasons that we all know. Larrain's masterfully crafted a way of telling a story with delicacy and finesse that is lovely and captivating. I loved the idea that Larrain had Stewart portraying Dianna almost in a monologue, with just the perfect touch of cameos with a terrific supporting cast. Magnificent screenplay by Knight cleverly carrying the story silently as the monarchy requires.It is undeniable that Stewart should take the top award for acting; her flawless mannerisms and beauty resemble princess Dianna with perfection. Greenwood's musical score is delightful and melancholic that at times had a touch of Jazzy sounds encompassing the climax of some of the scenes, beautifully and with elegance. Everything on this film is top-notch, cinematography, costuming, production design, etc. The end of the film is excellent! A well-deserved moment of normalcy with the people she loved the most!!!""All I need is a miracle; all I need is you.""",Spencer
1019,60,VintageSoul56,"""A Fable Based on True Events""",6/10,14 November 2021,"This is the first thing that you see on the screen. I like it. Someone that has a YouTube channel focusing on fashion, Amanda Hallay, hit it on the head when she said don't expect this film to be a biopic of Diana. It's slow moving. She compared to 1965's ""Repulsion"" starring Catherine Deneuve and 1975's ""Barry Lyndon"" starring Ryan O'Neal. The ""Repulsion"" comparison comes with Diana's mental state at the time. The things that she thinks she sees. I did like the ""ghost"" of Anne Boleyn. Their stories are different how they became what they had become, but in the end, their stories entwined. The ""Barry Lyndon"" comparison comes with the slow moving and atmospheric piece of the story. It's beautifully shot. It presents itself as a prison that this young woman feels encased in. I could definitely see that. I will say that it was very hard to understand the dialog. I didn't catch a lot of the dialog I've had the same problem in this particular independent theater. I don't know if it's me or their sound system. Maybe a combination.Now, about Kristin Stewart's performance. I'm sorry, I just could not see her as Diana at all. I know that she is getting rave reviews, but I couldn't buy into it. What I could buy into, was that she was a young woman totally unrelated to Diana. A young woman who was troubled by her mental state, the traditional and rigid personalities and customs of her in-laws, the infidelity of her husband, the love that she had for her sons. That's what I saw, a young woman that could be anyone, but not Diana.",Spencer
1020,61,alfredsmith,Boring,4/10,23 November 2021,"I must admit, quite surpringly, that Kristen Stewart was amazing in this movie but that aside, the whole thing was a total bore. Perhaps if you were very young and knew nothing of Diana, you might be interested but everything in the movie has been covered by the news and media at length since her unfortunate death. At least the narrative seemed impartial and at times Diana came across as quite selfish and weird, contrary to the media making her a saint. I thought that was a reasonable and fair assessment of what she was probably like.The one positive of this movie? I will be watching all of Kirsten Stewart's movies from now on.And why the weird aspect 1.66:1 ratio?Give this a miss.",Spencer
1021,62,li0904426,Nothing new!!!,6/10,25 November 2021,"We all know now, especially with details coming from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle interview how suffocate is to be part of the royal family. Actually, I do believe the film was maskedly based on that interview to tell how Diana must have felt during the Xmas period before her decision to leave the palace. Great performance by Stewart but the direction was not that great, especially on the scenes when Diana remembers her childhood, too cliche.

1022,63,guskeller,Stewart is electric,9/10,10 November 2021,"The centerpiece of Spencer is undoubtedly Kristen Stewart's electricity. Stewart disappears into her tortured character, displaying longing, frustration, and defiance manifested from the deep sorrow of her confinement. Spencer hinges completely on Diana's distress, and Stewart's potent layers easily fuel the entire experience. Meanwhile, the supporting cast provides plenty for Stewart to play off of. Sally Hawkins, Sean Harris, and Timothy Spall each have their moments, yet the scenes with Diana's children (Jack Nielen and Freddie Spry) are the heart and soul of the film.Spencer is solidified by its technical aspects. The stark cinematography uses suggestive framing, methodical movement, and natural lighting to create an atmosphere of captivity and melancholy. The production design and music unite to set the audience in an excessively opulent lifestyle while also reflecting Diana's emotional state. Lastly, the wardrobe plays a central role in capturing the era, expressing Diana's mentality, and driving plot points. Spencer might seem repetitive and melodramatic to some, but its craftsmanship should absolve its faults. Overall, Spencer is a vivid experience that should stick in the minds of its viewers. It might not pop as a flawless masterpiece, but it certainly strikes an emotional chord.Writing: 8/10

1023,64,benjaminskylerhill,It hits more often than it misses.,7/10,7 November 2021,"Spencer's central performance by Kristen Stewart is one for the ages. There are so many thoughts that can be read from her facial expressions alone, and her choices of tone of voice add deeper layers to it. It's truly mesmerising.When the film is focusing on being a soulful meditation on the simple desires of human beings for free expression, it excels. Many scenes are thought-provoking and relatable to a great degree.Unfortunately, the film is not always as focused as it ought to be. It's too long, often repetitive to the point of redundancy, and sometimes FAR too melodramatic for its own good-to the point that it's characters become annoying rather than sympathetic.It's admirably ambitious, however, and Stewart solidifies herself as a legitimate contender for an Oscar with this. I would not be upset if she won.",Spencer

She was dressed up as Diana trying very hard to talk like her and move like her, it was like watching someone with an expensive Halloween costume. She wasn't convincing at all, you don't see Lady Di.

Princess Diana was equally cold. This was just a great casting.

1026,67,huntersmithx,Kristen Stewart defies the odds in a cinematic fable.,10/10,12 November 2021,"It feels like yesterday when divisive reactions washed over the press and film community due to the casting of Kristen Stewart as one Princess Diana; now we bear witness to some of the most rapturous acclaim the American actress has received in her career. A bold new chapter for the former teen idol, or blatant Oscar bait? Audience and community reactions beg to differ, but the critics have it right. Pablo Larraín's Spencer comes from the most sincere breed of awards contender- one that stirs the soul in the most restrained yet unexpected ways.The scene is December 1991. Diana, Princess of Wales, is simultaneously one of the most cherished, sought-after and widely criticized people in the mass media; we as an audience witness her grappling with the expectations of her family, her contentious husband Prince Charles, being apart of her childrens' lives and grappling with her personal demons.It's been a long tradition for filmmakers to make quote-on quote ""action movies with words"" out of contained dramatic situations in a limited span of time, and Pablo's film here, fed by the immaculate writing of U. K. auteur Steven Knight, is another title to add to these movies. There's also shades of non-Good Will Hunting Gus Van Sant (Elephant and Paranoid Park) in how both directors make the most of their slow-burn stride.The way the story unfolds is, quite simply, pages from a biography or fable brought to the silver screen in the best way. The filmmakers were even wise enough to address this film's fable makeup in the opening title cards, and with that out of the way we witness a blistering Psycho-Drama that leaves us in questioning as the credits roll; also go in knowing that no conventional biopic afternotes are to be found here. Yes, history buffs will either endorse or tear into the historical liberties taken here; but time and time again people like myself take the best of cinematic historical fiction for what they are- movies equivalent to stage plays that exist to make a point, whether that'd be something about history, our human subjects or moral principles.Rarely has a film over the past few years, aside from exceptions like Uncut Gems, have captured anxiety as shrewdly as Spencer. A dinner scene within the first 30 minutes is a prime example as Diana must hold herself together in front of her spoiled, dysfunctional family. The notorious mass media blitz that followed Diana for much of her professional life is kept to a minimum here, which also aids to Pablo's indie workmanship, and provides a new lens to the everlasting documentation and fiction around Diana and her royal family. A scene showcasing fellow members watching paparazzi close in on Diana during a church Christmas session is particulary glowing in melancholy and intensity.I didn't know until the closing credits that the impeccable score was composed by Johnny Greenwood. It's both awards-worthy and flexible in many tones- at times it evocates British royalty typically heard in these kinds of movies, but it can also be blistering in suspense and psychologically troubling, plus there's even Jazz overtones in several scenes. French cinematographer Claire Mathon worked throughout the 2000's in short film territory to break into bigger and better prospects; she finally earned her due with Portrait of a Lady on Fire and proves that she's not a one-hit wonder here in Spencer. Her variety of wide-angle shots and prolonged takes are a wonder to behold, plus there's a colorful, muted sheen that lends the film an earthly, dreamlike quality.Kristen Stewart might continue to be a polarizing actress amongst evaluators of current cinema (the Twilight films certainly didn't aid her nor Robert Pattinson), but she has proven her dedication to the most prestigious affairs in art-house cinema over the past several years. With all eyes on her in a role that numerous contemporaries would stake for, Stewart is not only serviceable as Diana- she excels. She's simultaneously endearing, funny, shy, and can both show and tell her wide-ranging emotions. Her voice and makeup almost erase any trace of the public image of Kristen Stewart, except for one scene where she laughs alongside her companion Maggie, a royal dresser. We truly feel her yearning for a life beyond royalty, and the pain of being surveillanced 24/7 by the people she trusts most, not just the media circus.While Stewart will likely clean house with accolades, the rest of the cast shouldn't be ignored- Timothy Spall and Jack Farthing are both ominous in presence as Alistar Gregory and Charles respectively. Jack's Charles is the best kind of unlikeable in just about every scene he's in. The other standout is aforementioned Maggie, played by Sally Hawkins. Mrs. Hawkins has been a U. K. cinema darling throughout the 2010's, and she earned her due in The Shape of Water. Despite her limited screentime here in Spencer, Diana's yearning for her and Maggie's bond when they're together is captivating.There've been case studies of when a highly publicized actor or actress takes on a role of biblical proportions to re-establish their credit in tinseltown, only to set their career back several steps (not to mention the wrath of the Golden Raspberry Awards). Spencer and Kristen Stewart is not one of them because there's a harminous foundation of thought-out and sincere writing, respectable talent in front of and behind the camera that makes Stewart's contribution to Diana's legend an essential cog of a well-oiled machine. Spencer is Oscar-worthy, not Oscar-bait, of the highest order.RATING: 4 out of 4 stars.",Spencer

Diana felt like a real person and look what it did to her, I mean the only press they seem to get these days is negative. The only royal with an ounce of real in them left aswell.It's slow, painfully slow, the acting whilst not bad is just idiotic because of whispering and childish dialogue, I thought I'd feel sorry for Diana as that was always my gut thing but this just made me dislike her, I disliked the others more but just found her to be incredibly petulant and childish rather than mentally unwell.It's not a pleasing ending, it's not a film that ever needs revisiting, it must be awful to be will or Harry and see their family shown in such a way. It's just all round a waste of time and money and does nothing of any good.After thousands of films of every genre I'd easily put this in the lowest 1%.

I don't give Kristen Stewart the crap other people do. She did fine in this movie. Does she deserve an oscar? I'm not sure. The synopsis for this film is wrong. If that's what it's about, they failed miserably. I don't want to spoil anything but watching this movie was kind of like watching a horror movie. If I was supposed to watch unhinged Diana for 2 hours, they did a great job, but it wasn't a pleasant experience.

1030,71,annlevtex,A Different Diana,6/10,25 November 2021,"I applaud the film for taking a different approach to the much-visited story of Princess Diana's struggles within the royal family and in general. The writer and director narrow in on a brief, specific window of time, a Christmas at Sandringham with all of its regimentation and meticulously observed traditions, and depict the inner torment and tension that Diana feels within it, all of which comes to an unexpected crescendo of release and then a pretty satisfying denouement.The production value is excellent, particularly the kitchen scenes where a stern but sympathetic head chef (well played by Sean Harris) guides his staff through a series of lavish meals like a man leading his troops into battle, all the while admonishing them to keep the noise down lest they be heard and disrupt the illusion of seamlessness above stairs.The burden falls on Stewart to carry the film, and she turns in a technically impressive performance as Diana. She has the accent, the mannerisms, even the walk. She manages to appear taller than she is. She immerses herself in the role and hits the dramatic peaks convincingly. But her performance is almost too intense, perpetually wound, abrupt, and a little mannered, at least early in the film and in the scenes where Diana is at her most uncomfortable.I can believe that Diana was a nervous wreck at this time, but she had a natural aristocratic languor of sorts that doesn't come through here. Stewart is at her best when interacting with characters with whom she would have felt a rapport: the chef, her dresser Maggie, and her two sons. At other times, she is brittle rather than vulnerable. I preferred Emma Corrin's Diana on ""The Crown,"" which goes to show that sometimes it is best to cast an actor who has more natural resemblance to the character (physically and culturally) and let the performance unfold. Watching Stewart here is at times just exhausting, and the score can become so overbearing that it gets in the way.The dramatic climax, which takes place in Diana's childhood home near Sandringham and involves a cathartic series of visions and flashbacks, is actually very good, as is the aftermath where Diana effectively reclaims her name and identity (hence the title ""Spencer""). The two young actors who play Will and Harry bring the kind of naturalistic grace that only child actors can manage and too often lose with time.Overall, worth watching for production value, strong performances and interesting material. But it's uneven and too strenuous. I admire the work Stewart put into this role, but that doesn't mean I felt as connected to the character as I would have liked.",Spencer
1031,72,denise-882-139023,A masterpiece of movie making.,10/10,23 November 2021,"I shied away from this film.Never a big fan of all things Diana during the universal frenzy over her every move. I travelled a good deal for work and no matter my destination, once people heard I was from London, England, the inevitable questions about princess Di would ensue. It drove me nuts. Not unlike the the pent up emotions of Lady Di in this film.Anyhoo, my daughter convinced me that it was definitely my kind of film, so I went to see it.It was surreal, claustrophobic, suffocating, mesmerising, extremely sad, with the odd uplifting scene; a true cinematic experience.The horror undertones (that score) made this all the more fascinating to watch.Honestly did not expect this high level of sophistication in a film about Diana. A triumph.",Spencer
1032,73,bjacob,Not a biopic but a really good horror movie,8/10,7 November 2021,"The story of Diana is more than a pretext for this film, but it's less than a subject. It's a vehicle to narrate the depersonalisation engendered by living inside a total institution, like could be a panopticon kind of prison, an asylum or a cult, but happens here to be the Royal Family. The control of the body becomes a subtle or not so subtle proxy for the control of the mind.Spencer is not factually correct nor it tries to be. It's not a biographical movie by any stretch of the imagination, it's a creepy, dark fairy tale, more similar in intent to Psycho than to your average biopic. The structure reminds me of some 70s art house horror movies, where there's a vague intimation at the end that maybe it was just all a dream, that the protagonist was an unreliable narrator and if their struggle was very real, the film definitely isn't a documentary about it. Indeed the details are used in an impressionistic manner instead of a chronicle. Like in all the self-respecting nightmares, at the end we wake up, in a sort of reassurance for the spectator: ""don't worry, you'll escape from the haunted house / you won't die"", which has an additional dark overtone here because it's based on a real story that actually doesn't end well.It's a surprisingly good movie, also superbly acted and with great music. I recommend it also -- and probably especially -- to those who have little interest in the British Royals.",Spencer

She WILL be up for an Oscar and I believe the film will as wellIt's not a standard drama by any means. At times it feels like one, but then twists and turns between beauty, sadness, anxiety and borderline horrific fever dreams. It more an A24/Arthouse style film than a basic drama.Kristen channels Diana giving the performance of her career, and the rest of the cast is flawless as well.The film is beautifully shot and the soundtrack combined with the the cinematography can take you into almost Kubrick style madness when needed, then wrap right back to a dramatic calm. It's absolutely brilliant and not what i had expected.I can't wait to Own it. I'm floored. A truly moving, powerful work of art.",Spencer
1034,75,FilmFlowCritics,Well.... that was unexpected!,7/10,9 October 2021,"When I first heard that Kristen Stewart was cast as Princess Diana, I was sceptical I must admit.. The American does a great job though in picturing one of the most loved British people of all time.I dont want to spoil anything, I just say that sure...we all knew the gossip, the conspiracies, the theories about Diana and her death, but still, almost 25 years later, this movie still brings aspects to the story, that are fresh, new and provocative. It was a bit more psychedelic than expected and I enjoyed that movie much more than I thought I would and it surely will not be liked by the royals, especially Prince Charles, he wont be amused with his depiction!

1035,76,JoelAlexanderr,"Never does Princess Diana justice due to some silly, over-dramatic writing",5/10,13 November 2021,"It's that special time of year! Around Thanksgiving and Christmas every year, moviegoers get hit with a bunch of biopics that are solely made so they can generate Oscar buzz and hopefully take home a couple of statues. Rarely do I see a movie as committed to this purpose as SPENCER, the new Princess Diana biopic with Kristen Stewart in the lead role. This is a film that tells three days in the life of Diana in which she is attending the annual Christmas dinner with the British Royal Family. At this point, she has made known her disposition as someone who does not conform to the old and outdated traditions of the crown, and the animosity from the rest of the family is heavily felt during her entire stay. However, she cares very deeply for her two kids, William and Harry, and she is a great mother despite all of the hardship she faces from their father, Charles. The movie's primary focus is showing the ways in which Diana does not fit in and how she retaliates against the forces that are trying to keep her in line.There is plenty of artistic merit to be found in SPENCER, mainly from a technical perspective. Director Pablo Larraín, who has already flexed his biopic muscles on films like Jackie, helms yet another true story like a pro. His skillful direction, along with the incredible cinematography from Claire Mathon, makes the film look stunning and almost like a VHS tape from the 90s at times. The decision to come out so overtly against the British Royal Family was also a bold and powerful decision that I believe was necessary for this film to succeed. A Diana biopic would not work without some serious criticism shelled out towards the British elites, and this movie is not shy in its contempt for the way the Royal Family treated her. I'm glad that the message people will take away from SPENCER is one of sharp disdain for the regime that has controlled many people's lives, so the success the film may have come awards' season will not seem entirely unfounded.Somehow, despite some great ingredients in the mix, SPENCER still fell flat for me because of some over-dramatic and silly writing that made the narrative feel like a mediocre recreation rather than an authentic account of Diana's mental state. I don't have to be a history expert to know that most of the events shown in this movie are dramatic retellings that didn't actually occur, and the script relies on these overpowering and absurd scenes to tell the story more often than not. Did this film need to be 100 percent true? Of course not. Movies like One Night in Miami are complete fabrications, yet they still send a powerful message about their time without feeling like they are doing wrong by the real people they depict. SPENCER sometimes feels like it is doing a grand disservice to Diana's real-life struggle by depicting many over-the-top dream sequences with overly emotional acting and metaphors that are so on-the-nose that it feels like a parody of itself.All of this, unfortunately, has an impact on Kristen Stewart's lead performance, which always feels like an impersonation of Diana rather than a natural depiction of the real person. I don't believe this blunder is entirely Stewart's fault, for there are many scenes where she clearly has the emotional and physical attributes of the character down. The writing is what stops everything here from soaring for me, and if the movie wasn't so fixated on creating ridiculous dream sequences with Anne Boleyn and awkward confrontational dinner scenes that feel straight out of a well-shot soap opera, then perhaps Stewart's performance could have shined more.I can't emphasize the overuse of metaphors enough as being a major issue of this screenplay: multiple times Steven Knight's script hits us with heavy-handed and silly metaphors such as the ""horse that can't be tamed,"" or the ""beautiful yet misunderstood bird that is simply bred to be hunted,"" or the ridiculous Boleyn dream sequences meant to give an artsy take on Diana's situation. Along with this, the movie sometimes paces itself like an art-house horror movie in order to make the audience feel isolated and scared like Diana. These choices come across as jarring and confusing at best with a Jonny Greenwood score that obnoxiously distracts from each scene.At the end of the day, SPENCER is an artistic mess made with good intentions and talent. I appreciate much of the thought-process that went into the themes and messaging here and I definitely wouldn't mind if another movie expanded on it, but the execution comes across as forced and awkward for much of the runtime, rendering moot any of the film's potential impact. I don't see most viewers being wowed by this odd and sometimes silly movie despite it being about such a powerful public figure, but critics and lovers of risky decision-making in movies might find enjoyment in it. Larraín and others definitely put a lot of effort into the technical aspects of this movie and none of that will go unappreciated come awards season I'm sure, but the movie as a whole never seems to take off and never justified my viewing experience.C.",Spencer

1039,80,cotta002-318-865119,A missed opportunity,4/10,28 November 2021,"Diana Spencer is such a complex and intriguing person that any movie taking on her story has to be done well or fall it to kitsch stereotypes, this movie I'm afraid does the latter.The script takes the viewers through Diana's last Christmas weekend at Sandringham with the Queen and the Royal family where she finally makes up her mind she will seek a divorce from Charles.It could have been so much better in script as well as directing. Prepare yourself for awful and loud background (hardly) music brought by the ""screech and wail"" orchestra, I don't know why the producers thought it a good idea to drown out the dialogue but so be it.I was looking forward to watch this movie, not to blame the cast ,they did as well as could be expected with the script they were given but really some impossible scenarios played out hoping that the audience will ""get it"" is just not good enough to waste this incredible story capitol on.I hope another writer , director and production team attempts to tell her story in the future but for now this one for me is filed the same as royal wills are kept, sealed for 90 years!!",Spencer

No story, all over the place, crazy dialogue. Lesbian confession near the end? What?? Kristen Stewart was nothing close to Diana. She very much missed the mark. In mannerisms and speech. The guy who directed Jackie directed this and that explains a lot. Is he strangely confused about women or something? He paints them in a very odd light with fragility very center stage. Which leaves me to also wonder if he seeks to tear down these females in their positions of power. Oh well he got my money and will likely get a lot more if everyone else had the curiosity I had to see if Kristen could do Diana. It's a no. And the movie itself is just not good. I almost cringed myself to death when Diana walked into the line of pheasant fire, ugh. This wasn't Diana, this is Kristen being herself dressed like her role, exactly what we always see from her. 4 stars out of 10 because there was some decent acting from others, and good scenery.",Spencer
1041,82,karlmartin-47352,It's the score that makes it...,7/10,15 November 2021,"As a film it is very good with some excellent performances from the cast, but the true standout was the musical score written by Johnny Greenwood which is absolutely masterful. It really fills you with absolute dread and fear during the course of the film & much of it really feels like a horror/thriller/drama which sucks you right into the world of the lead character. Yes, of course I know that it's derived from a real person's perspective, but exactly how much truth there is to it I couldn't say but none of that stopped me from enjoying the film one bit.

The movie, which discussed the history of ""Princess Diana"" in detail, was about one event, and the film focused on the psychological aspect of ""Diana"" and the struggles she was experiencing against the media and the royal family, being a character that did not adhere to customs. And the family traditions, the performance of ""Kristen Stewart"", which I frankly did not accept at first, but with the viewing, it merged and really proved itself. Clarification of this thing at the beginning of the movie, a movie for lovers of drama and dialogues. I personally enjoyed a lot while watching, I recommend it.

1045,86,branflakes4547,Great visuals and performances - questionable ending,7/10,11 November 2021,"I'm not sure who this movie was made for. It's funded by some very wealthy people and it almost feels like it was made personally for them. By doing this I think it gave the director more range, the shots are very relaxed and open. Beautiful costume and set decorations, and of course Stewarts fantastic perfromance. One thing I loved was they kinda gave some of the frames a sepia retro feel, which felt very authentic especially with the clothing from the 90s. I would recommwnd it if you want a smooth watch, there's not a lot of action and it's definitely eye candy. On a side note, I could not unsee Naomi Watts in Kristen Stewart. Specifically in Mulholland Drive. It's freaking uncanny! It didn't harm the experience but man. They are two very beautiful ladies.

1049,90,Hopedoesnotdie,Visually cool but kind of a wet blanket.,7/10,6 November 2021,"So the cinematography, costumes, sets, and visuals are pretty amazing and I love the grainy 16mm look they had. Kirsten Stewart was pretty good because there were times when I did lose myself in the character and not the ""actress"" but I thought it painted Diana in a very depressing light. First off, Kirsten Stewart looks like she's in pain and about to cry in almost every scene, nothing is really earned, she's miserable throughout almost the whole movie (with a little bit of lightness with the kids) but I just felt they made Diana look like a compulsively depressed shrew with serious mental illness. I mean I know they call it a ""fable"" based on a tragedy but the film didn't make her look strong or really independent but more like a miserable prisoner shackled in chains who is constantly being tortured. Very depressing film in my opinion.

She copied Di's walk and mannerisms to a fault that is just a shade shy of parody. What this move does, is portray Diana in a horrible light. She's pathetic, spoiled, entitled and most of all... off her rocker crazy. This is the only time that I've seen Diana portrayed in this light. It takes place over three days at Christmas time. Charles answers for nothing. KS is front and center the entire film, often walking, dancing and being a spoiled brat (as portrayed). This is a horrible film. The Naomi Watts film was better by a long shot. Diana's sons must be horrified at this and the attention that it's getting. Kristen Stewart should be ashamed.

When it popped up on my ""On Demand"" I didn't hesitate to commit the $20 rental fee. Bad idea. Perhaps it is too close to the CNN bio in time to switch gears to a wacky, surreal version of what Diana endured? Let's just say that's the issue. It is very well acted and filmed. The supporting cast is strong. Yes, Stewart will win awards for her portrayal of Diana. The costuming is especially noteworthy as every outfit evokes a memory of having seen it before on the real Diana - although each is not a perfect replica. I'd like to watch ""Spencer"" again in a year and in 5 years to see if I like it better. I think I will as the memory of the real Diana fades.

1052,93,Michael_Arm,Stewart deserves an Oscar nomination,5/10,29 November 2021,"The film is not what you'd think....it's certainly from the flighty perspective of Diana and uses some crafty metaphors to draw visual context to her mental and emotional status during the films time period. Opening with the phrase ""A fable from a true tragedy"" we the audience can expect more fiction than fact.....however it's my take that it's nearly impossible to get an absolute understanding of Diana's mental & emotional status but we can imagine how she would be feeling and it's the work of director Pablo Larrain to make that happen. Pablo does a good job using metaphors and dreamscape however it's also through these methods that the film begins to take a Alice in Wonderland turn. Set in the early 90's when Diana and Charles's relationship was nearing the end one can only imagine the stress and turmoil that Diana was experiencing. Stewart does a phenomenal job embodying Diana in look, speech, and mannerism. There are many times in the film that Stewart's eyes reflect the same shy humility that Diana would display with a simple glance or expression of her eyes.The film is outlined by a score from Radiohead member Johnny Greenwood and it is absolutely terrific. The music fits perfectly with the metaphorical imagery Pablo uses throughout the film.Even though I wasn't a big fan of the movie I can appreciate the direction and methods used to bring the script to life. The acting of Stewart is spot on and she 100% deserves an Oscar nomination.Think of Eyes Wide Shut before watching and it'll help prepare you for what you're about to see.",Spencer
1053,94,gregorybates-71071,I love Kristen Stewart,7/10,27 November 2021,"I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It was not very good in my opinion. I had high expectations for this movie. I love Kristen Stewart so that's why I give it a 7/10. I would say that I felt sorry for Diana when watching this. I love how the movie portrayed how they treated her even though I believe they treated her worse. I didn't like how they made her look crazy, that was wrong. But again, I love Kristen. She's one of the GOATS but horrible movie.

1054,0,boblipton,Just Sit Back And Enjoy Yourself,8/10,23 October 2021,"Wes Anderson's latest movie, under thinly disguised names, supposes that Harold Ross, instead of going to Manhattan to found THE NEW YORKER, had moved to France. There, with the same writers and cartoonists, he turned out essentially the same magazine, but with, understandably, more of an emphasis on France than on Broadway. We are then graced with Bill Murray as the editor dealing with his writers, as Tilda Swinton narrates her tale of insane prisoner Benicio Del Toro inventing a new movement in art; Frances MacDormand covering a student uprising while bedding leader Timothée Chalamet, while editing and writing an appendix to his revolutionary manifesto; and Jeffrey Wright covering the novelties of ""cuisine policier"" with the commissioner, which turns into a hot pursuit as the commissioner's child is kidnapped, and his chef must take the lead in the recovery.I am a great fan of Anderson's cartoonish, highly detailed cinematic worlds, in no small part because he is constantly winking at the audience, letting them know they are in on the joke, as he manipulates aspect ratios, colors, timelines, and moves walls aside in plain sight, His actors seem to enjoy themselves. This is Bill Murray's ninth appearance in an Anderson movie, Owen Wilson's eighth. Other well-regarded performers include Lea Sedoux, Mathieu Amalric, Bob Balaban, Henry Winkler, Christopher Waltz, Willem Dafoe, and a dozen others. Nor do they come for the big parts; they seem to be happy to show up. When the show ended, two men in the audience began to discuss how the aspect ratios and moving walls had some significance to the underlying meaning. Perhaps I lack the depth to understand such things, but I think Anderson tells his little tales and wants us to have a good time. Does that make it great art? Perhaps not. Sometimes it's enough for us to smile.",The French Dispatch
1055,1,Horst_In_Translation,"Still has its moments, but a massive drop in quality in the second half keeps this way below Anderson's finest career achievements",6/10,16 November 2021,"""The French Dispatch"" is the newest film by writer and director Wes Anderson. He is in his early 50s now and is probably considered among the most overdue filmmakers in Hollywood to finally win an Oscar, especially in terms of writing. Unfortunately, this work here will not get him any closer because I believe it is inferior compared to most of the stuff he has done in the past and if it gets nominated, then for art direction or something. But first things first: This runs for briefly under 110 minutes and Anderson once again worked with Hugo Guinness, Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman and this quartet came up with the story. Basically, it is several stories in one film. We have the framework and three pretty much independent stories that are articles from the paper this is all about. The French Dispatch. The cast, as always with Wes Anderson, is packed with big names and he also has a tendency to cast people who he worked with in previous films. I will not give you all the names because you can check out the list yourself. Even some characters who had almost no screen time at all are played by very familiar faces (Henry Winkler for example, I recognized him immediately, but the name I just could not remember while watching). But some actors who get a lot of screen time are Oscar winners Benicio Del Toro and Frances McDormand. Also Timothée Chalamet is included a lot here. Jeffrey Wright gets a solid amount of minutes in the final chapter. I personally also found it nice to see Adrien Brody here as one of Anderson's regulars because I liked the actor (another Oscar winner) and I don't see him that often in other projects anymore nowadays. Tilda Swinton I must admit I did not even recognize. She is so much better usually than in this film, even if the material is to blame for the most part. Nothing to work with kinda. One of three females though exposing their breasts. Lyna Khoudri (another one) was easy on the eyes for sure. Willem Dafoe definitely did not have a lot of screen time and I would have liked him to be featured a lot more here. What can I say, I like the actor. A lot.One thing that came to my mind again is that Anderson likes to include young, here even very young, actors for his stories. Of course, not as heavily as in Moonrise Kingdom, but those scenes with Saoirse Ronan were all about the little boy that got abducted. Steve Carell is not in this film though even if I was almost certain he was when I watched it. Ah yes, but Christoph Waltz is in here. He did a lot (when sitting on the table) with the nothingness he was given really. Another performer/character that would have deserved a much bigger deal of screen time. It also came to my attention how this film featured a decent amount of Bond actors. I mean with Seydoux, Waltz and Wright, it was a big reunion of the most recent Bond, even if they all share absolutely no screen time here because they are in different chapters. Add to that Amalric and Del Toro who have also played antagonists in Bond films in the past. Maybe others I forgot. Or who will show up in the post-Craig era. Sorry, my 007 obsession is once again getting the better of me. Anyway, I thought that Seydoux here was part of the by far best segment, the one with Del Toro at the center of it all. She also added a lot to that. How she looked into the cell there when Del Toro's character was talking to Brody's was hilarious in a typical Wes Anderson way. We also see her naked from really close. I mean she has been naked in other films, most of all ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" (""La vie d'Adèle""), but still I was amazed how stunning and breathtaking she looked in this one here when she posed as a model for Del Toro's character's painting(s). Admittedly, this chapter still got a bit messy here and there, also in the end with the prison riot and an abrupt finish, but it was nonetheless the easily most enjoyable aspect to the entire film.Things do get worse immediately afterwards. Way worse. I like Frances McDormand otherwise, even if maybe not as much as five or ten years ago. Three Oscars seem a little much. This film here is not helping either as far as I am concerned. The layers they brought to her character felt unauthentic and for the sake of it. Like how she is troubled, struggling with solitude maybe, but enough of an important fugure to see Timothée Chalamet's character naked in that pseudo funny scene from the trailer. Or make a connection with the same young man when they lie in bed together. Just as friends of course. Or how they leave the apartment on one occasion. Or how we hear the voice in her head saying to herself that she should stay quiet, stay out of it, but she just can't and steps forward and makes a speech to the young woman. That almost felt like an Oscar moment. She must say something. It is inevitable and what we hear is oh so true and thoughtful. But it was not just her of course. It was the entire chapter. Especially with Chalamet. With him I am not getting the hype at all. This cleaner rebel take on James Dean with curly hair they have been giving us for a while now I am not buying at all. His acting seems nothing special to me and I have seen him in quite a few films. These moments when they try to turn him into some icon like also with this movie when he is on the scooter with Khoudri's character, his head in the wind, the cigarette in his mouth. Really all make-believe. So exaggerated, but the sad thing is that there the film really took itself seriously I think. It was not one of the many comedic moments. Still, I am happy Khoudri got to star in here with the attention the film got. The last segment then with Jeffrey Wright whose character's name was also Wright was a bit better again, but also nothing inspiring. Looking at how well Anderson did in the past with food- and kitchen-themed segments, it was a bit of a disappointment too. The opening shot with what people drink at the place mentioned in the title was pretty much better than the entire third segment. Even if it was this brief, but typical Wes Anderson there. Very easy to identify. Just like the scene in which we have Owen Wilson's character cycle through the streets and all that happens there. Also the animals included.Bill Murray I must mention too. He plays perhaps the most influential character of the entire film and like Wilson a regular with Wes Anderson too. However, he is just part of the framework, okay also talks to Wright for example, but he does not have as much screen time as you could have thought from the trailer. What else deserves to be mentioned here? Oh yes, there is a fairly long sequence of animation. No big surprise as Anderson has worked on animated movies as well in the past, but still felt a bit unusual to be included as a segment of a live action film. It was okay. Like the rest you could say, but did not stand out in terms of style either. Maybe it was funny how the really big and strong guy was up there holding on to the front shield of the car. I mean there are some fine moments that will make you smile and there is always creativity to Wes Anderson's films, but here I felt it was maybe a little less than you usually get with him. Perhaps it also had to do with the lack of color in this film from beginning to end. At times, it is even black-and-white, but it is never really a colorful film because it maybe would not have fit the subject too well. Beige is incredibly dominant here, especially with these scenes that take place at Bill Murray's character's office. Anderson also played a bit there with us. We think that Murray's character is already dead at the beginning, but then it is just all about the preparation of the actual death of Murray's character. We can be glad he is alive. Are we really? Do we care? In any case, in the end he is actually gone. We even see his corpse. But hey, no crying in his office. So yeah, I like some of Anderson's works a lot, but here I am almost tempted to give a negative recommendation. Only the strong first segment with Del Toro keeps me from doing so. I will still not judge you in a negative way if you turn off the film after said opening segment before the 45-minute mark and skip the rest of the movie. Admittedly, you would not be missing much, especially during that occasionally awful Chalamet segment, also with the character's death out of nowhere that turns him into an even bigger icon. Troubled genius, sigh. That's all and I hope with the next film(s), Wes Anderson will be back to his best again. I am optimistic he can be. (tt8847712)",The French Dispatch
1056,2,lee_eisenberg,Timothée Chalamet gets his annus mirabilis in Wes Anderson's ode to print journalism,10/10,15 November 2021,"I've liked every Wes Anderson movie that I've seen, and to that I can now add ""The French Dispatch"". If you've seen Anderson's previous movies, then you should have an idea of what to expect here (centered scenes, quirky characters, clever dialogue). In this case, the plot involves the final issue of a magazine and the topics that the magazine will cover. Lots of neat stuff in store.As always, Anderson casts Bill Murray, while his occasional cast member Anjelica Huston narrates. Also appearing are Anderson regulars Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzmann, Adrien Brody, Bob Balaban, Willem Dafoe, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton. Appearing for the first time in an Anderson movie are Timothée Chalamet, Henry Winkler, Lois Smith, Elisabeth Moss, Griffin Dunne, Benicio Del Toro, Christoph Waltz, Jeffrey Wright and Liev Schreiber (if I remember right, Mathieu Amalric and Léa Seydoux are appearing in an Anderson movie for the second time). With this movie and ""Dune"", I'd say that Chalamet has had his annus mirabilis this year.Anyway, great movie. You're sure to love it.",The French Dispatch
1057,3,jboothmillard,The French Dispatch,7/10,1 November 2021,"I saw the trailer for this film, and I recognised the distinctive style of its director immediately, always symmetrical imagery, many bright colours, often surreal or eccentric, and an all-star ensemble cast, so I was up for it in the cinema, written, produced, and directed by Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs). Basically, set in the 20th century, Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray), the editor of The French Dispatch, an American newspaper in France, has died suddenly of a heart attack. The final wishes in his will state that publication of the newspaper is to be suspended immediately following his death, with one final farewell issue. The newspaper will feature three articles from past editions of the paper, along with an obituary. This collection of stories is brought to life. It starts with The Cycling Reporter: travel writer Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson) gives a cycling tour of the town of Ennui (French for ""boredom""), showing several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pick-pocket's alleyway, and observing how much and how little has changed over time. The first story is The Concrete Masterpiece by J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton): Mentally disturbed artist Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro) is serving a prison sentence for murder and paints an abstract nude portrait of prison officer Simone (Léa Seydoux), who he develops a relationship with. Art dealer Julien Cadazio (Adrien Brody), also serving time for tax evasion, sees the paining in a prisoner art exhibition and is immediately taken by it, and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release he convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world, with his paintings in high demand. Three years later, Cadazio and other artists are angry at Rosenthaler's lack of further artwork, they bribe their way into prison to confront Rosenthaler, and discover that he has painted a series of frescoes on the prison walls. Angered that the paintings are irremovable, Cadazio gets into a fight with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum. For his actions in stopping a prison riot that breaks out during the paintings being revealed, Rosenthaler is released on probation. The second story is Revisions to a Manifesto by Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand): The report focuses on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the ""Chessboard Revolution"". Despite Krementz's insistence on maintaining ""journalistic integrity"", she has a brief romance with self-styled revolt leader Zeffirelli (Timothée Chalamet), and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Fellow revolutionary Juliette (Lyna Khoudri) is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz tells the two to ""go make love,"" which they do. A few weeks later, Zeffirelli is killed trying to repair a small radio tower serving as a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes a symbol of the movement. The third and final story is The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner by Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright): During a television interview, Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer-slash-chef Lieutenant Nescaffier (Steve Park). The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi (Winsen Ait Hellal) is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals. After a series of interrogations, the police discover the kidnapper's hideout and stake it out. Following a shootout, Gigi manages to secretly send out a message in Morse code to ""send the cook"". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout to provide the criminals with good, but secretly laces the food with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison, along with Lt. Nescaffier after being made to test it first. But one criminal escapes with Gigi and this leads to a police chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and jumps into the police car. At the French Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to re-insert a segment he previously removed about a recovering Lt. Nescaffier saying something to Wright about the taste of the poison. In an epilogue, the French Dispatch staff, including Sazerac, copy editor Alumna (Elisabeth Moss), cartoonist Hermes Jones (Jason Schwartzman), the Story Editor (Fisher Stevens), the Proofreader (Anjelica Bette Fellini) and the Legal Advisor (Griffin Dunne), mourn Howitzer's death. After paying their respects, they immediately set to work putting together a final issue to honour his memory. With the voice of Anjelica Huston as The Narrator, also starring, in alphabetical order, Quantum of Solace's Mathieu Amalric as The Commissaire, Bob Balaban as Uncle Nick, Jarvis Cocker as the voice of Tip-Top, Willem Dafoe as Albert 'the Abacus', Bruno Delbonnel as Tip-Top, Rupert Friend as Drill-Sergeant, Alex Lawther as Morisot, Edward Norton as The Chauffeur, Larry Pine as Chief Magistrate, Morgane Polanski (Roman's daughter) as Girlfriend, Tony Revolori as young Moses Rosenthaler, Saoirse Ronan as Junkie / Showgirl, Liev Schreiber as Talk Show Host, Christoph Waltz as Paul Duval, and Henry Winkler as Uncle Joe. The all-star ensemble cast all bring something different to the table, the switching from black-and-white to colour in many scenes is interesting, the scenes of animation and characters freezing in poses are eye-catching, and the perfectly symmetrical imagery and eccentric feel throughout is exactly what I've come to expect, I can see why it is described as ""a love letter to journalists"", a worthwhile comedy-drama. Very good!",The French Dispatch
1058,4,CinemaSerf,Don't try to make much sense of this and it's quite enjoyable...,7/10,7 November 2021,"I suppose like any newspaper or magazine upon which this compendium effort is based, there are some ""articles"" more interesting than others - and that's what this offers. Three elongated features form the centrepieces of this somewhat surreal comedy. As you might expect from Wes Anderson, these stories are eclectic, and delivered well by a cast that were well up for their tasks. My favourite of the three features Frances McDormand and Timothée Chalamet offering us some sort of Hemmingway-esque parody of revolution fought over a chess board - with quite humorous results. Humour is a strong feature of this film. I would say comedy, not so much. One has to pay attention to what is going on to get the best from the acting, the script and, as importantly, the imagery which effortlessly mixes monochrome and colour, and which is also bright, vivacious, and frequently just as informative as the dialogue. It does run out of steam at times, the themes could have been a little more compact, and the two side-stories - especially the travel report with Owen Wilson at the top of the film didn't work so well for me. I'm not an huge fan of eccentricity - it is all-too-often just hit or miss, but here we have more hits than not, and with a healthy swipe at journalistic values along the way, a bit of romance and some daft antics from a rogue Benicio del Toro, this is certainly worth watching.",The French Dispatch
1059,5,george.schmidt,Masterful filmmaker Wes Anderson's most ambitious production extends his reach in twee-ness in spite of a powerhouse cast,8/10,29 October 2021,"THE FRENCH DISPATCH (2021) *** BENECIO Del TORO, ADRIEN BRODY, TILDA SWINTON, LEA SEYDOUX, FRANCES McDORMAND, TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, LYNA KHOUDRI, JEFFREY WRIGHT, MATHIEU AMALRIC, STEVE PARK, BILL MURRAY, OWEN WILSON, BOB BALABAN, HENRY WINKLER, LOIS SMITH, CHRISTOPH WALTZ, LIEV SCHREIBER, WILLEM DAFOE, EDWARD NORTON, SAOIRSE RONAN, ELIZABETH MOSS, JASON SCHWARTZMAN, FISHER STEVENS, GRIFFIN DUNNE, (narrator - ANJELICA HUSTON) Masterful filmmaker Wes Anderson's most ambitious production extends his reach in twee-ness in spite of a powerhouse cast of eccentricities in his latest venture about a fictitious American magazine stationed in France with somewhat colorful writers, a dyspeptic publisher, and varying degrees of criminal activity afoot.

1060,6,ferguson-6,the most Wes Anderson-y to date,8/10,28 October 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Few things in the cinematic world are more instantly recognizable than a Wes Anderson movie. In fact, historically speaking, perhaps only Jacques Tati comes as close to having a signature style easily spotted by viewers. This is Mr. Anderson's 10th feature film in 25 years, and I now rate 5 of these very highly, though all 10 have a certain appeal. This latest, co-written by Anderson with frequent collaborators Roman Coppola, Hugo Guinness, and Jason Schwartzman, could be considered his most ambitious to date ... and likely the most 'Wes Anderson' of all.Billed as a love letter to journalists, it becomes crystal clear, that by this, Anderson means the esteemed stable of writers from the early days of ""The New Yorker"". In fact, Anderson structures the film as if it were following the path of a magazine being published. We are informed upfront that this edition features ""an obituary, a travel guide, and 3 feature articles"". An episodic format is not unusual for films, yet Anderson never does anything by the book. Each piece takes place in its own time period, and there appears to be little connection or crossover among key characters. Still, somehow he makes this work by ensuring each piece stands on its own and is filled with unusual characters and those patented, fabulous Anderson visuals.The obituary is that of Arthur Howitzer Jr (a deadpan Bill Murray), the founder and publisher of ""The French Dispatch"" magazine, a spin-off from The Liberty Kansas Evening Sun ... a move from a small town in Midwestern United States to a charming small town in France (hilariously and fittingly) named Ennui-sur-Blasé. Howitzer adores his writers, and the only guidance he offers them is, ""Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose"". He also has a ""No Crying"" sign posted in his office, likely as much as a reminder to himself as a rule for the staff.Our travel guide section is fortunately quite brief since it involves Owen Wilson as a bicycle tour guide showing us around the town - the ""Local Color""- of Ennui-sur-Blasé. This takes us to the first feature story, and the best of the lot. Tilda Swinton excels (doesn't she always?) as a writer and art expert giving a colorful lecture entitled ""The Concrete Masterpiece"". She tells the story of Moses Rosenthaler (Benecio del Toro), a genius modern artist serving a life sentence for murder, and as she lectures, we see it play out. While incarcerated, Moses continues to work and his muse is a prison guard named Simone, played exceptionally well by Lea Seydoux. Her nude posing for him leads to his signature modern art piece, which attracts the attention of an ambitious art dealer played by Adrien Brody.""Revisions to a Manifesto"" is the next feature, and it involves a young activist named Zeffirelli (Timothee Chalamet). He's a chess expert, quite moody and has a questionable quest. He's being covered by writer Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), who is unable to maintain objectivity, and inserts herself right into the story, amongst other things. The segment pays tribute to the activism of the 1960's and is filmed mostly in black and white.The third feature, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner"" involves writer Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) telling his story while a guest on Liev Schreiber's Talk Show in the 1970's. Roebuck is obviously inspired by James Baldwin, and he famously recalls every line he's ever written. The story he recites involves a legendary chef played by Steve Park.Actors mentioned so far are just the headliners, and Anderson has packed the film with his usual troupe, as well as dozens of others - some you'll recognize, and some you won't. There are at least seven Oscar winners involved: Christoph Waltz, Fisher Stevens, and Angelica Huston (as narrator), in addition to the aforementioned Swinton, McDormand, del Toro, and Brody. Numerous Oscar nominations and awards are included in the group of other familiar faces like Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Lois Smith, Henry Winkler Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Moss, and Mathieu Amalric.Other frequent Anderson collaborators who deliver standout work include Production Designer Adam Stockhausen, Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, Editor Andrew Weisblum, and composer Alexandre Desplat. The film looks and sounds remarkable, and somehow it doesn't feel like it's moving fast - although we can barely keep pace. The film can be compared to ordering a flight at your local distillery. Each flavor is tasty, but they may not add up to a full drink.Wes Anderson has delivered another stylish, fun film to watch, and one that is endlessly entertaining. It may not have as many moments of laughter as some of his previous films, yet there are still plenty of sight gags, insider references, and light-heartedness bathed in nostalgia - even if it's not quite as whimsical. Shot in the French town of Angouleme, the visuals are as impressive as any you'll find, serving up a collage of time, caricatures, color, and topics.Opening nationwide in theaters on October 29, 2021.",The French Dispatch

It has an all star cast in a collection of off the wall stories. Bill plays the editor of an American newspaper that is located in France-their headquarters are in Kansas-and the stories are told to him by his journalists/reporters and published in his newspaper, The French Dispatch. One has Benicio as a psycho/murderer in prison that loves to paint, with people desperately wanting to buy his paintings. Another has Frances covering student uprisings and yet another one has Jeffrey relating a kidnapping of a policeman's son. They all contain cameos by actors you will recognize-Timothee Chalamet, Willem DaFoe, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, HenryWinkler, Edward Norton and Elisabeth Moss, just to name a few-but the stories are just so weird, it's as if Wes was just trying to be weird for weird's sake. Examples; The painter is in a straight jacket when he is not painting naked women but the paintings don't look anything like them. The kidnappers have a chef bring them food, during a shootout with the police. Some scenes are animated during a chase scene and returns to normal-if you can call it that-after the chase is over.It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you might enjoy it more than I did but otherwise, I'd wait until it comes to cable.",The French Dispatch

But this is his best piece of work since The Pianist. I think he has a great flair for comedy as well as being a fine dramatic actor; and he looks so much like Thomas Tafero. Del Toro is also excellent in one of his rare comedic turns, Swinton is always good, but Brody steals the film. Anderson has created a wonderful world that is both fantasy and realistic at the same time. I loved the pseudo-intellectual pandering and the patrons of the arts who will buy anything as long as you give them a good pitch. It is a film to be seen more than once, because it is highly unlikely you will catch all the satire the first time around.

To beginning with, the bicycling reporter has no viable means for his self defense when a gang of hooligans dangerously succeed in dislodging him from his preferred mode of transportation. This outrage never would befall someone with a Peacemaker within obvious easy reach. Next, the painter guy has to resort to a meat saw to cut a couple of rude bartenders down to size. Surely, he would have been sent to a regular prison instead of an asylum IF he had chosen a sensible .45 caliber to deal with the offending barmen. A third FRENCH DISPATCH reporter documents the fatal flaws plaguing students relying upon manifestos and chess games to achieve needed academic reforms, when shooting irons obviously will do the trick more efficiently. Only the kidnappers and their lawmen opponents have the sense to resort to actual firepower in this movie's final segment, but the deviant police cheat us out of a feel-good BONNIE & CLYDE-style climax by breaking up a righteous gunfight with poison radishes! Surely such misbehavior should prompt viewers to redouble their support for their local chapter of BANGS: Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps.",The French Dispatch
1066,12,aciessi,All The Film That's Fit to Print,6/10,6 November 2021,"Alert the press! We have another Wes Anderson movie. The French Dispatch is Wes Anderson's long awaited live-action follow-up to The Grand Budapest Hotel, which garnered the best acclaim of his career as his most visually exquisite film to date. Dare I say, The French Dispatch nearly tops The Grand Budapest from aesthetics alone. Visually, this film is a mind-blowing work of art. It's absolutely beautiful, from frame to frame. To take your eyes off of it, for a mere second, is to punish yourself. Every fabric and every set piece is meticulously crafted to an absurd degree. It's enough to say that The French Dispatch won me over in the end. Even though, on substance, I felt it to be hollow and cold. This is arguably Anderson's most insular film. About as Ill-disciplined as The Royal Tennenbaums, but not as excruciatingly ponderous as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Luckily, Anderson treats us to a series of original vignettes, which spaces things out just enough to keep you from feeling restless. My favorite segment was The Concrete Masterpiece. Adrian Brody had me doubled over, I must admit. The Cycling Reporter was the most useless vignette and arguably should have been cut or re-written. This is a mixed bag and I wish it wasn't. I say, catch this when it arrives on streaming platforms.",The French Dispatch
1067,13,Movi3DO,Weird but beautiful,7/10,31 October 2021,"Wes Anderson is back with another bizarre movie, and this time it's about three independent stories written for the last issue of a magazine, the French Dispatch.I don't watch a lot of Wes Anderson, but I love the Grand Budapest Hotel. His movies all have distinct editing style, frame, and especially color. To love Wes Anderson's filmography, you need to embrace the dream-like, surreal, yet beautiful looks of his movies.The French Dispatch took this to a more extreme level. The three stories were so damn weird that it was usually hard to follow. Characters retelling stories in messy order like they have ADHD, which kinda made sense because we usually say a lot of things when we are excited.Even though the stories were confusing, the look and editing were full on amazing. There were so many different editing styles that it's like a soup of color and unique camera shots. Some scenes made you look left, right, or corners at the same time (unless you know French).Overall, a magical looking movie that I'm sure Wes Anderson fans will love. 6.5/10.",The French Dispatch
1068,14,kjproulx,"An Enjoyable, Overstuffed Anderson Outing",7/10,24 November 2021,"I admire the work of Wes Anderson very much. It's always obvious when you're watching one of his movies. He has a style that just jumps off the screen and becomes instantly recognizable. For that reason alone, I always look forward to a new project of his. The French Dispatch is now playing in select theatres and after viewing it, I must say, even though I quite enjoyed myself, it's not one of his best works. Here's why The French Dispatch didn't quite work as well as his other films for me, but also why you still may want to check it out.Set in a faux version of a French city, The French Dispatch follows the goings-on of a magazine company called ""The French Dispatch"". After establishing the atmosphere and feel of this company, the rest of the film is in three segments, each of which is a story that was written in this magazine. The short stories are all very, very well-made and almost feel like three separate Wes Anderson short films. That experiment was nice and I enjoyed watching all of them, but this is also my biggest complaint about the film. I felt as though each story didn't quite fit with one another. I felt like I was getting to know new characters every 30 minutes and that was a bit of a turn-off for me if I'm being honest. Again, I really enjoyed these stories, but I found that each story could've been expanded on further as its own film.The incredible cinematography, quirky dialogue, and overall unique style of every Wes Anderson film are also present here and work very well, which was frustrating to me this time around. Due to the fact that I felt the stories needed a little more breathing room, I felt a slight disconnect from all of the other great stuff. I admired the look, laughed with a lot of the dialogue, and once again was mesmerized at the look of the film, but I walked away not feeling much. That may just end up being a personal gripe I have with the film and others may completely disagree with me, but as wonderful as Wes Anderson is and as great as I think portions of The French Dispatch are, it all didn't quite mesh for me.On top of all of that, when it comes to the cast of all of his films, he always nails it. The French Dispatch is no exception to that notion, but the cast was almost too large. I understand each story had different characters, but it felt like a new Hollywood star was on-screen every 5-10 minutes and it became slightly distracting. Again, I might be nitpicking this movie too much because it's actually very good overall, but it just felt overstuffed.In the end, The French Dispatch is a wonderful showcase of great and unique filmmaking. The problem is that as soon as I began to care about each of the stories, they were coming to an end. This in turn bored me because I kept needing to latch onto new things all the time. Some of my favourite scenes of the year are sprinkled throughout this movie, but I just wish the movie as a whole was just as great. Now playing in theatres, if you're a fan of Wes Anderson's work, I recommend checking it out. If you happen to be a very casual film fan, this one can wait, even though I still feel pretty positive overall.",The French Dispatch

I thought it was too over the place without much of a structure and no real plot at all. This kind of bothered me, I know this was the intention but for me it just didn't make the click it was supposed to make.But and that is a huge BUT, although there is no visible plot and the stories itself were not too interesting for me, this film involves some of the best dialogue work Wes Anderson has ever written, and this truly makes up for it.Also the cast is stellar. Even the smallest roles are filled with star power like Edward Norton or Willem Dafoe. What an outstanding ensemble. Its hard to single out any but if I have to I would say Benicio Del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Timothee Chalamet, Jeffrey Wright and Frances McDormand were the best of the of the bunch, with characters that seemed to be written for them. But also Adrien Brody and Bill Murray have really good moments. I loved the look and feel of the film, which was typical Anderson. Not a biggest fan of the black/white and color twists because he overdid that one. Still its a charming film. Not the kind of thing I was hoping it to be, but another nice entry after all in Wes Andersons fantastic filmography, even if this is among his weaker ones.",The French Dispatch

This is actually four stories in one about American ex-pats who write for a French paper.Everything is stylized in this film and works effectively. Watching the Benicio Del Toro story unfold is the most fun. The rest seem to be muddled in more pretention.One gets the feeling Wes just sits around like an overgrown child and makes vroom vroom noises as he drags a toy car on the carpet. This is quitessential Wes.Very well crafted.

1072,18,owen-watts,Warm Off the Press,7/10,6 November 2021,"Anderson's latest is one of his most intricate confections yet - a love letter to the New Yorker magazine and a concept anthology more than it is a coherent filmic narrative. I dig it though and the rare (for him) excursion into 2D ""ligne claire"" animation is absolutely gorgeous. The Murray emotional core is too crowded out to emotionally land as it should and the sheer wealth of cameos is almost hilariously superfluous with some of the greatest actors of our age getting one line or none at all. Not his strongest work but as always, he's somehow managed to push the form even further to create meticulous piece of art with no visual equal in the mainstream.

1073,19,sweidman-28016,100-Minutes of Happiness,8/10,5 November 2021,"""It began as a holiday. Eager to escape a great future on the Great Plains, Arthur Howitzer Jr., transformed a series of travelogue columns into the French Dispatch. A factual report on the subjects of world politics, the arts, high and low, and diverse stories of human interest.""The French Dispatch is a love letter to journalists set in an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional twentieth century French city that brings to life a collection of stories published in ""The French Dispatch Magazine"". Wes Anderson. I mean, where do you begin? Most everyone knows his distinct style that's whimsical and charming. Over the years, he's amped it up and we all love it. This has to be his most stylistic film to date. The whole film is about style, really. Looking at the screen it's hard to believe someone created that perfect look. First of all, the cinematography has literally everything you could want: different aspects ratios, black and white, color, unique framing, the list goes on. Paired up with it is the production design. Maybe not as great as The Grand Budapest Hotel, but it's incredible to look at. We have a wide variety of colors painting the set. One of the stories is actually about a painter, and though it's mostly in black and white, it's bursting with color. A cool thing with the sets as well, and we have seen this before, is how some are done on a stage and they have the resources to continue the scene in one shot but also change the setting by the use of a backdrop. There's a really cool example in one of the stories starring Timothée Chalamet. You could analyze the set design and look for hours and still not cover every little detail.With Anderson's past films, he's set standards to what his best is. Those answer may vary from person to person. For me, at least, it's The Grand Budapest Hotel and Fantastic Mr. Fox. In The French Dispatch, he does something different that may turn people off. The film is several short stories paying respect to writing and France itself. There is no overarching story. Because of that, there's hardly any character development. That's sort of the point because we know these stories for a short period of time, and never hear anything again. If you are looking for an overarching story, I guess you could say it's with Arthur Howitzer Jr. And selecting stories for the new addition of the magazine. However, that's about five minutes at the beginning and five minutes at the end. I like how there's not too much development, but I also wanted a little more from the characters. It felt like we were watching people with little to no significance, and I wanted to know just the slightest bit more. Because it's so charming and mesmerizing, it's easy to forget about it. Some stories are more interesting than others. That's up to opinion, but my favorite is with Timothée Chalamet and Frances McDormand. As usual, we have a grand ensemble with many stars. Everyone does great, some even going out of their usual typecast. Nothing groundbreaking, but still good. Lastly, I should add that Alexandre Desplat gives us another fun score. He and Anderson have an understanding in what they want, and it always works. With that, we have a fantastic soundtrack full of songs from France. There's one amazing use of music (yes it's in my favorite segment) that makes the viewing and listening experience so pleasing. If you're an avid Wes Anderson fan, The French Dispatch will deliver. Even if you're not, you'll probably find joy and a good amount of comedy because it's really funny. I want to see it again just for 100 minutes of happiness.",The French Dispatch
1074,20,ethanbresnett,If you like Wes Anderson you will LOVE this film,9/10,1 November 2021,"If you aren't keen on Wes Anderson then give this film a wide berth as it is the most Wes Anderson film you could imagine.The characters are so well penned, all of them bringing something rich and quirky to the film. As you'd expect from the stellar cast they are all wonderfully portrayed. Every scene offers up about 3 or 4 cast members who either have been, should have been or will be Academy award winners. It really is something else.Like any Wes Anderson film the story is so unique, detailed, character driven and just bizarre. The French Dispatch boasts 3 separate stories which all offer something slightly different and are all so enjoyable to watch.Then there is the direction from Wes which is as you'd expect top notch. This film is just a feast for the eyes, with the colour pallete, the use of black and white in certain scenes, the framing, the camera work, the use of animation all fantastic. Everything is so Wes Anderson and so beautifully shot. I reckon you could pause this film at any given frame and end up with a brilliant canvas to hang on your wall.Absolutely brilliant and my favourite Wes Anderson to date.",The French Dispatch
1075,21,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Deeper into Wes Anderson's hole,9/10,10 November 2021,"Somehow, Wes Anderson's movies keep getting more and more impressive, and on top of that, more and more insane. On paper, the plot to this movie would sound ridiculously dull, but Anderson is one of those weirdos who can take the most lukewarm concepts and turn them into something completely mind-blowing, primarily through his visual artistry, and his knack for uniquely witty and complex dialogue.But there's always more to it. Of course, everything you see is the most astonishing element of the film (sets, wardrobe, cinematography...and the additional animated segments were a much welcomed surprise), but the movie is also packed with iconic performances. Of all the films I've seen Benicio Del Toro in, this is going to be one of the top ones I remember him in from here on out. This was also the first thing I appreciated Jeffrey Wright in - his presence and voice was so disciplined, I was whoa'd by it. And finally, Lea Seydoux wears the crown for my favorite appearance in the film - her character manages to be so simple and so complex at the same time - she gets to show immense strength and intimidation, and complete vulnerability at the same time - it's really quite amazing.While the movie is mostly an unpredictable tram ride through bizarre conversations and happenings, it does have a couple of minor weaknesses in my eyes. First, I thought the first story of the 3 felt much more cohesive, where as the next two didn't feel like they had much of a ""wrap up"", not that that's big of a problem - just something I feel could have added a bit to the flawlessness of the film otherwise. And, considering what a legit fan of Timothee Chalamet I am, it was kind of odd to walk away feeling like he was the only cast member that felt a bit out of place. He did well, but I felt like literally every single other cast member collectively encapsulated the signature Wes Anderson world energy, whereas he very much had his own Timothee Chalamet energy.This may be Anderson's most stylish film yet, aside from maybe The Grand Budapest Hotel, my personal favorite of his many masterworks. Even if you can't get into the deadpan vibes, or understand what the story is about, the visual artistry is an immense feat on it's own - if you can go to a museum and appreciate a painting or a sculpture, you should be able to see plenty of magic here.",The French Dispatch
1076,22,Okonh0wp,The first Wes Anderson film I'd call overkill,6/10,24 November 2021,"As Wes Anderson has shifted settings from a boarding school to a Jaques Costeau homage to a brothers' expedition across the Indian subcontinent, I've gobbled up pretty much everything Wes Anderson has given me in the previous six films I've seen of his.The French Dispatch, however, shows that even great directors can have an off day.Anderson's style is pretty instantly recognizable by the carefully constructed mise-en-scenes and a whole-hearted embrace of anachronisms. But there's more than the visual artistry. There's also a quietly uplifting sentiment of people being vulnerable about their need to belong and finding connection in found or real families.While the same theme is here with the newspaper crew being united in their love by the editor (Bill Murray), the decision to divert from the main story into three vignettes takes away from the film's main emotional arc. The end result is a feeling of cold remoteness that's a thin line between what Anderson delivers on and what he can be seen as at his most indulgent.Still, it's not a complete failure of a film. It gets a lot of points for ambition..One of theHowever, this film is the.",The French Dispatch
1077,23,euroGary,"Huge fun, mostly",8/10,14 October 2021,"'The French Dispatch' consists of three main stories, so it is probably inevitable that one of them is less successful than the others. It is nothing to do with the actors concerned - principally Tilda Swinton, Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Léa Seydoux - simply that the story of an imprisoned artist becoming The Next Big Thing drags a bit. The other main segments - Frances McDormand and Timothée (still not sure how to pronounce that) Chalamet in a tale of student unrest; and Jeffrey Wright, Mathieu Amalric and Liev Schreiber caught up in a police operation including a kidnapped child and fine dining - are rollicking good fun.The conceit of these tales is they are all articles in the final issue of the 'French Dispatch', a supplement to a Kansas newspaper that brings French culture to the American Midwest. As the journalists tell their stories, the audience sees artistic pretentions and student naivety knowingly skewered. The acting is universally good and it would be hard to single out one performance - although how the whippet-thin Chalamet twice managed to deliver the line ""I'm embarrassed by my new muscles"" with a straight face is beyond me.The film is a mixture of black-and-white, colour and - in an inspired choice for a chase sequence - animation. Even the opening- and closing credits are entertaining (indeed, if there were an Oscar for best opening credits 'The French Dispatch' would win hands down). I saw this at the 2021 London Film Festival and will definitely watch it again - although possibly I will put on the kettle during the jailbird artist sequence.",The French Dispatch
1078,24,movieman6-413-929510,A film from Wes Anderson's own fantasy,6/10,13 November 2021,"The French Dispatch is a new comedy directed in part written and produced by Wes Anderson, the director of Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums.The film is about a few stories from the latest issue of an American magazine, The French Dispatch magazine. This is the last issue as editor-in-chief Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray) passed away. Out of respect, the publisher tries to make it a worthy final edition. So they end with a few special stories.Wes Anderson knows how to play in his own way with this film and it almost seems to come straight from his own fantasy. He plays with elements that he also used in his previous films and brings them back in his own way in this film. This is fun for fans of Wes Anderson movies. For people who are less familiar with his films or who are not a fan of them, this film can be a bit difficult to follow or will enjoy this film less.Due to the mosaic storytelling of the film, the story can also be difficult to follow, because the stories are somewhat separate from each other and different from play time. Most of the characters in the film are also played by actors and actresses who have previously worked with Wes Anderson. Due to the size of the film cast and the different stories, it is not really clear that a main character emerges and each story seems to have more of its own characters that experience what.Furthermore, Wes Anderson plays a lot with how he has portrayed the film, as he uses different ways to do this. For example, the image format of the different scenes differs and he switches from filming in color to black and white or even animation.",The French Dispatch

1080,26,darkreignn,Extremely enjoyable,9/10,31 October 2021,"""The French Dispatch"" is undeniably one of the most flat-out entertaining films I've seen in theatres so far in 2021, and this is coming from someone who isn't even a huge Wes Anderson fan. I typically find his movies to be quite cold - visually stunning, but emotionally distant - so imagine my surprise when I found myself entranced not only by this movie's remarkable visuals but also from its tender stories that depict the lovely, tragic, and unpredictable beauty of life.""The French Dispatch"" takes an anthology type approach to its plot that explores three unique stories and many unique characters. The ensemble cast that Anderson employs portrays a wide variety of characters that are a complete joy to watch; Timothée Chalamet as a cigarette enjoying wannabe revolutionary, Léa Seydoux as a soft-spoken but strong in conviction prison guard, Steve Park as a head chef who seems to believe that he has tasted all there is to taste - Anderson compiles a bizarre, relatable, and lovable, assortment of characters that all point toward the richness of individuality.From minute to minute, ""The French Dispatch"" is a celebration of reality, and an ode to people. I found the compilation of stories and portrayal of so many different types of people very life-affirming, and I certainly left the theatre in a better mood than I was when I entered it. I've read some reviews that state the film loses momentum after each story, but I disagree. I found each of the film's three stories equally as engaging - but even if you don't, I still believe you'll enjoy the overall experience of watching this film because of how beautiful it is to look at and hear.Anderson once again proves himself to have quite an eye for pleasing visuals. The film goes back and forth from color sequences to ones that play out in black and white, and regardless of if a certain scene is in color or not, every frame, shot, and sequence is bursting at the seams with style and flair and life - it literally felt like my eyes were eating up the scenery, and I can confidently say that I haven't seen a movie that looks this good in a long time. But Anderson also shows a masterful employment of music here that just enhances the visuals; one sequence in particular with Léa Seydoux walking past artwork, the scene going from black and white to color, with gorgeous music playing as Léa walks and admires, was simply stunning in its combination of sound, cinematography, and vibrant color.Listen, I don't really have much else to say because, simply put, I found ""The French Dispatch"" to be highly enjoyable. If you're not a fan of Wes Anderson you may be put off by his trademarked style, but then again, I'm not really a fan of his, and I found myself loving this movie from beginning to end. While walking into the theatre I was unsure if this movie would warrant a movie theatre experience, I can now say that I am very happy to have seen this on the big screen, and if you have any interest at all in seeing this, I encourage you to do the same.",The French Dispatch
1081,27,TheVictoriousV,"""Enjoyable"" incarnate",8/10,12 November 2021,"I gather from the younger side of Film Twitter that Wes Anderson and Greta Gerwig are the mommy and daddy of modern indie cinema (if ""indie"" even means what it used to). For all I know, Anderson and Gerwig may be considered ""mommy and daddy"" in that exact order.The French Dispatch, along with Gerwig's Little Women, supposedly confirms that both of them also have ""custody of the kids"", the kids being Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan (both stars are Gerwig regulars, but only Ronan has worked with Anderson in the past). Interesting metaphor - all we miss is Hedges and Pugh as ""the cousins"". I'm glad Film Twitter isn't just 20-30-somethings yelling at each other about Joker and Star Wars.Being a Wes Anderson film, The French Dispatch of course features plenty of other celebrities, here portraying writers, journalists, and artists of many kinds (lauding everything from cuisine to the art of painting). Bill Murray is inevitable (having appeared in all Wes Anderson-directed films except Bottle Rocket), but we also get Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Jeffrey Wright (as a sort of James Baldwin analog), each with their own piece of writing to present. We see Owen Wilson, Elisabeth Moss, Adrien Brody, Léa Seydoux, Lyna Khoudri, Liev Schreiber, Stephen Park, Edward Norton... the list goes on.As is also par for the course, their names sound vaguely mid-European and/or reference a type of beverage you can enjoy by the fireplace in a comfy chair. Anderson's uniquely quaint atmosphere needs no introduction, nor his ""symmetrical"", punctilious, masterfully colored visual style.However, Anderson takes a minor break with this one. Parts of the film are presented in black-and-white and the camera moves more freely through these environments than we're used to; it's not all zooms, jibs, and whips. Nevertheless, this is very much Anderson's mood - that is, again, for the most part; some segments are remarkably heavy and poignant.The film has multiple stories, some of them dramatizations of tales published in The French Dispatch (more precisely, ""The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Eve. Sun"", a foreign magazine for an American newspaper), while the frame story focuses on the bureau personnel. There are many callbacks to issues from The New Yorker, an old Anderson favorite.But as I mentioned, the film celebrates so much more - so many more arts - than simply writing. The flashbacks/stories-within-the-story are black-and-white (sometimes in a way that mimics pre-1940s Hollywood, not just because of the tight aspect ratio), but vibrant color interrupts the monochrome whenever astonishing beauty is experienced by the characters. This includes the reveal of Benicio del Toro's latest and most personal painting, Jeffrey Wright painstakingly detailing his experience of exotic foods, and (as if Anderson knows my biases too well) Saoirse Ronan revealing her piercingly blue eyes to a prisoner.The French Dispatch is oddly humorless at points, but aside from these tonal missteps, this is a wonderful piece of work; as charming when it's in color as when it's in black-and-white (I especially liked the shot where Chalamet looks like he's climbing the RKO Pictures radio tower seen at the beginning of 1933's King Kong). Filmed largely in Angoulême and scored by Alexandre Desplat (Anderson's go-to ever since Fantastic Mr. Fox), this is one of those movies that redefine the word ""fanciful"".And once again, what a lovely cast of old veterans and promising youngsters. Chalamet and Ronan are well-known at this point, having starred together in amazing films like Lady Bird and Little Women and also having films like Call Me By Your Name (Chalamet) and Hanna (Ronan) under their belt, but their careers are still on the young side and I already want to see their next film. And yes, I should hope that both parents retain custody.",The French Dispatch
1082,28,Lewis_Heather787,Repeat viewings needed!!!,6/10,30 October 2021,"I will admit that I had very high expectations for this film as soon as the first trailer dropped. It looked like it had the potential to be one of Wes Anderson's classics. Is it that? To be honest, I'm not quite sure because this film will 100% require repeat viewings for anyone to fully grasp everything going on in this film. I am also not sure that's a good thing.For me there is a lot going on in this film, maybe too much going on at once. In places throughout the film I did get a bit lost so much so that I started to lose interest ever so slightly. Now I know that having too much Wes (and his quirky/unique style) in one film, doesn't work all the time. There are story lines, aspects and characters that I really really enjoyed in this film. However there are also paths this film takes that aren't as interesting or rewarding as you think they would be.I am not trying to take away though from the incredible achievement this film is in terms or writing, directing and editing. I am telling you now, this film will be nominated for multiple awards this year......I have no doubt. The script for this film must have been one of the longest ever written. There is so much information packed into every single scene, interaction between characters and narration over the top. It is a lot to handle as an audience member but also makes you marvel at the sight of a technical genius, like Anderson, at work. I have a feeling this film is what it is like inside his brain hahaha. To have the imagination and vision to create this film is breath taking. All the complexities to the story along with the constant screen format changes, black and white to colour, time jumps and animation.......you name it, this film has it!The best parts of this film were some of the performances from this truly incredible huge cast. Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody and Timothee Chalamet are all absolutely phenomenal in this film !!! Also a shoutout goes to Lea Seydoux again another great role delivered from her!! The rest of them were all terrific as well however the ones mentioned above caught my eye more and jumped off the screen in the scenes they were in.Overall though I would say that I am slightly let down by this film because I know I missed so much information just viewing it the once. Should a film launch so much information at an audience at once it needs a second viewing to understand it all. (Some films get away with it, like Tenet because that is a spy, mystery, thriller....... I don't expect it nor think it works in a drama such as ""The French Dispatch""). Doesn't fit the genre for me.65% out 100, I thought that the film overall was ok/good, although I did start to get bored slightly because there was too much going on. Plus not all the story threads were as interesting. I think a second viewing would enhance my viewing pleasure, I am positive it will. That doesn't take away though from the phenomenal technical achievement this film is.",The French Dispatch
1083,29,AdrenalinDragon,Wes Anderson's Triple Quirky Sundae,7/10,22 October 2021,"Every Wes Anderson trademark you could think of all told in a three story Anthology film. My personal favourite was the first story, and it never quite reached the heights of that one for me again. Shot beautifully and filled with quirky moments and humour as expected. I didn't emotionally connect with this as much as previous Wes Anderson's stuff, but still had a solid time with it and the time flew by. Performances were solid and the music was nice and melancholy. Got what I expected.7/10.

1084,30,sirwillisiv,"Artfully ambitious, narratively uneven...",7/10,13 November 2021,"The French Dispatch is good. Yeah, just...good. Its strength is the Wes Anderson touch and the film is caked with it. Fanciful sets, quirky performances, quick-witted dialogue, fans will surely get lost in his unique craft. That said, I found the film to be narratively uneven. I'm all for offbeat filmmaking but this anthology project came off as a bit stale compared to past Anderson efforts. Not insufferably so but only one and a half of the three vignettes were able to grip me while the rest were a bit of a slog to sit through. I believe the film is supposed to be a love letter to old-fashioned, unconventional journalism. Well, more power to Anderson for bearing such a niche fascination, it's just not my cup of tea. I give The French Dispatch high marks for its stylish production design and careful direction but the story surely has an acquired taste.

The problem with his 'style', is that it's all that there is. The stories are bland, the characters are lame. If you like watching a movie that screams hipster and 'ain't I'm clever', then this the movie for you. Wes' movies are good for screenshots as computer desktop wallpaper, but taken as a whole, they leave you feeling empty and wondering why you wasted so much time.

1086,32,hunter-friesen,Wes Anderson at the height of his power,10/10,17 September 2021,"*Watched at Cannes 2021*With each subsequent entry into his distinct filmography, Wes Anderson seems to make it a mission to make the most Wes Anderson film. The intricacies of 2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seemed quaint around the time ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was released in 2013. Even his side ventures into stop-motion animation contain a great distance in production quality between 2009's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and 2018's ""Isle of Dogs."" With Anderson's tenth feature film, ""The French Dispatch"" towers over all of his previous works with its masterful production qualities and international ensemble cast.Set within 20th century France in the fictional city of Ennui-sur-Blasé, ""The French Dispatch"" opens with the untimely news that the editor of the titular magazine, Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray), son of the magazine's founder and holder of a supreme eye for talent, has died. As per his wishes, his life is to be tied directly to that of the magazine, meaning that the publication dies with him. His team of writers - an eccentric bunch of expatriates all recruited over the years by Howitzer in one way or another - are granted one final issue, which they decide will contain ""an obituary, a brief travel guide, and three feature stories.""The obituary is, of course, for Arthur, while the travel guide takes one through the historic village that has acted as the publication's home for nearly half a century. The three retrospective stories selected are considered to be the best in the publication's long history: an account by the paper's art critic (Tilda Swinton) of the deranged painter Moses Rosenthal (Benicio Del Toro) and a brash art dealer (Adrien Brody); an on-the-ground report by political correspondent Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand) of the student revolution led by the charismatic Zeffirelli (Timothee Chalamet); and a retelling by food critic Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) of how he got entangled in a kidnapping involving the son of the chief of police (Matthieu Almaric).While there is no central story to fully move the film from start to finish, the anthology-style structure still allows Anderson to explore several of the themes found within his previous works, such as human curiosity and the ironic relationship we share with the world and its other characters. The final story of the food critic ranks as the best in terms of what's on the page, giving Jeffrey Wright a wonderfully complex character who unintentionally learns several valuable lessons about his place in the world.Some will find that the anthology structure limits the emotional connection one can have to the characters, especially since Anderson has built his career on wonderfully layered characters such as Royal Tenenbaum and M. Gustave. On the contrary, while many of his characters tend to overstay their welcome in a 100-minute narrative, the anthologies force Anderson to be as efficient as possible with character development, creating several sequences of mise-en-scène where the direction tells just as much of the story as the script.After gradually becoming more confident as a director, Anderson has finally allowed himself to fully unleash his unique brand of filmmaking. Visually, this is one of the most accomplished works ever made as Anderson toys with aspect ratios (very similar to the strategy within ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""), color and black & white cinematography, ingeniously hilarious freeze frames, and a period-accurate soundtrack that seems to always be perfectly queued. Ironically, the major complaint I have against the film is that there are dozens of expertly crafted shots that come and go in mere seconds even though they could be dissected for hours. Every frame truly is a painting as several hidden treasures can be found in every nook and cranny. This is a film that demands to be rewatched several times over to soak in every last detail.There are no weak links within the Robert Altman-sized cast, with players such as Adrien Brody (who seems to only deliver a good performance nowadays when directed by Anderson), Frances McDormand, and Jeffrey Wright. The phrase ""there are no small parts, only small actors"" doesn't apply here as people such as Christoph Waltz and Saoirse Ronan are reduced to minuscule cameos. Still, Henry Winkler and Willem Dafoe are able to do a lot with the little that they are given.A visual masterpiece bursting at the seams with talent both on and off the screen, ""The French Dispatch"" is a film by a director working at the absolute height of his powers. More importantly, the film gave me one of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences in a long time, with several rounds of applause from the Cannes crowd that seemed to be in love with the film as much as I was.I worry about how Anderson will be able to top this with his next film. But until then, I'll stay in the present and be thankful that something this magical is allowed to exist in a world that only seems to get bleaker.",The French Dispatch
1087,33,bastille-852-731547,"Wes Anderson's latest excels in wit, whimsy, and style",8/10,22 October 2021,"With his signature aesthetic and uniquely quirky vibes, auteur Wes Anderson has established a devoted following of fans--one of which happens to be me. I also am a big fan of The New Yorker, which the film plays homage to, so I was very excited to see this delightfully Andersonian homage to French cinema and culture as well as journalism and literary magazines. Needless to say, it didn't disappoint, and I think Wes Anderson fans are going to love it. The film chronicles the last issue of an outpost of an American newspaper based in the fictional French city of Ennui-sur-Blasé. The vast majority of the film is an anthology of three chapters, which are bookended by a delightful-yet-fleeting opening and conclusion. The first chapter, ""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" tells the story of an artist incarcerated on murder charges whose paintings become a sensation. In the second chapter (""Revisions to a Manifesto,"") the relationship between a journalist and a revolutionary, anti-conscription leader is profiled. In the third and final chapter, ""The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner,"" an eccentric police investigation that ends up getting entangled with both an acclaimed chef and a kidnapping plot occurs.Anderson's visual style is beloved by his fans, and suffice it to say the aesthetics in ""The French Dispatch"" are nothing short of superb. From wide shots to panoramic shots to split-screen shots, the cinematography is wholly unique and engaging throughout the entire story. The film toggles seamlessly between color and black and white, and is always gorgeous to watch. Even a late-film traditionally animated sequence is creative and clever. There's plenty of humor on display here too, both of the deadpan variety and of clever one-liners and reveals similar to many of Wes Anderson's other films. Anderson does a great job of connecting the three main stories to the operation, purpose, and writing style of the newspaper--and this narrative ""connective tissue"" is, in many cases, a critical part of having a successful anthology. The film is consistently fun and engaging throughout for those with a clever and highbrow cinematic palette, and never wastes any time. Even though the film can occasionally feel a bit ""style-over-substance,"" the story's consistent message honoring the importance of journalists--particularly expat writers--and the unique literary and visual trends in great journalism that can affect readers ultimately comes off as pretty profound by the time the film reaches its conclusion. The film is definitely an ensemble piece, which has its pluses and minuses. The concern about the ensemble structure of the story's casting and characterization is that sometimes the character development can be a bit skimpy or derivative; however, given the strengths on display overall here and Anderson's clear filmmaking talent, that is a relatively minor complaint. I'm not sure if those who aren't fans of Wes Anderson will be won over by this (it is VERY ""Wes Anderson-y,"") but those of us who enjoy this superbly idiosyncratic filmmaker will have a blast. Gladly recommended. 8.5/10.",The French Dispatch
1088,34,Nate-48,Biggest wes anderson disappontment,3/10,30 October 2021,"Wes Anderson has made two of my favorite movies - grand budapest hotel and royal tennenbaums but this forgettable movie ranks near the bottom of his work.The art and style is all there - a lot of tributes to the old french and italian cinema greats, to the silent movies back to meiles but what is missing is a cohesive compelling story.There is irony because you get 3-4 stories depending on how u look at it but nothing at all memorable or believable for a second.The writing is on the wall literally from the first scene when we are asked to indulge a joke that liberty, kansas (population 100) had a newspaper at one time with an office in paris. That alone was not enough to sink this movie - not with this great case of top notch actors.What is redeeming here is a few standout performances. If you hadnt seen benicio del toro before this movie is worth something because he shows again why he won the academy award 20 years ago for traffic. His eyes and facial expressions have a hint of lon chaney.Adrien Brody hits the mark and does not disappoint- however the script undercuts him and does not do him justice.They had Jeffrey wright playing roebuck wright who seems to have been partially based on the writer richard wright and a little James Baldwin partial composite though his story does not really resemble either Richard wrights character or James Baldwin that well ( both were american ex pat writers living in france at timeframe of the film) and frankly was quite the waste of time for the character who has the most lines in the movie.I know wes anderson likes to have his trademarks with these stories about how they always become unglued but this movie really took things to an extreme - there was almost literally no point to this nonsense.Add in some animation which he used in his boring movie isle of dogs- another sleeper and he completely lost me.A nude portrait scene was an example of the director's focus on the art crowd which did nothing for me and was another sign early that this was going to be bad. The scene did not do much to move the rather boring story and looked like a misfire of trying to be edgy.Also the use of black and white was ok sometimes and made the color scenes more powerful when they came out of the black and white - there was too much shifting between black and white color and animation - he overdid it. I liked the black and white scenes where he paid homage to the classic films but much of the b&w scenes were tedious.A scene involving an electric chair had some interesting metaphorical and symbolic value though that may have been just for shock value or laughs not sure.Three good scenes in the whole movie - a flashback scene paying tribute to Beau Geste (a three-second montage part of a larger flashback in the way royal tenenbaums does its ramones flashback scenes) an art scene and a quick shootout scene.This movie needed more great scenes - second story should have been cut out entirely.I gave it three stars - one star for art decoration, one star for the actors involved, and another star for the effort to pay tribute to the classic cinema.I cant give it more than three stars because that would be bad advice if you value your time and money. This movie is only going to appeal to the most loyal Wes Anderson fans and those overindulging in artistic self indulgence.This film overdosed on self indulgence.",The French Dispatch
1089,35,theredsky,The French Dispatch Review,8/10,18 November 2021,"Another great film from Wes Anderson. This film focuses on 3 separate stories and all of them are great in their own way but some are definitely better than others. I'll rank them at the end. All of the performances are great with my particular favorites being from Benecio Del Toro and Jeffrey Wright. Every cast member is fantastic in their role although I wish we saw more of Owen Wilson and Bill Murray. As always, the production design, cinematography, and writing are top notch. Although I like the more streamlined writing of his other films, Anderson does a great job at juggling three different stories here. Some stories are more interesting than others though and that kind of diminishes some of the other ones. I also found this film to be really funny as well. There were a lot of moments were I found myself laughing especially in the first and third story. The third story even goes through an animated segment and while the animation looks rough, it's intentional. It's truly something to see on the big screen. My ranking for the stories goes:
3. Revisions to a Manifesto
2. The Concrete Masterpiece
1. The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner
Definitely go see this when you can. It's a great film.",The French Dispatch

1091,37,Solnichka,The worst Wes Anderson film in quite some time,5/10,19 November 2021,"Seriously, I fell asleep twice: the first time during the Manifesto bit and the second time during kidnapping bit. This was just terrible; the artist in prison segment was the best one by far, and it's all downhill from there. And what a waste of talent! So many fantastic actors were barely on screen in this one. If you like Wes Anderson stuff like I do, maybe you will overlook the flaws and praise it anyway. But if you're being honest with yourself, this is one tenth the film MOONRISE KINGDOM was, for example.

1092,38,Camoo,"Partly maddening, partly delightful",6/10,19 November 2021,"Wes Anderson's films can be maddeningly fixated on minutiae that most directors would bypass in favor of getting to the heart of the story. One can surmise that the he most likely suffers from OCD, and has used his career as an outlet to grapple with his disorders. What else would drive him to whittle down his singular style into something like the French Dispatch, which, instead of broadening his directorial horizons into new territory, only digs itself deeper into the trenches? He's like a sculptor who has used a single piece of marble over decades: the sculpture becomes more intricate, in places more glorious, but the artist has failed to step back and appreciate the piece as a whole, and what might be missing due to this microscopic sculpting disorder.And fair enough. His career is one of passionate obsession, set within a few very specific aesthetic parameters, and he seems only interested in refinement. This is in part a huge comfort, since what he conjures are often compact works of magic. And while the French Dispatch does have some of that magic - he could never make a joyless film - it felt uncharacteristically lacking, and too focused on the tiny details rather than the big picture. For all of it's high-wired, frenzied antics, this narrative bored me for long stretches, which is rare for an Anderson film.The plot is not easy to summarize. This is an anthology flick, with multiple stories tied loosely through the reporting staff of a newspaper called the 'French Dispatch', helmed by Bill Murray's Arthur Howitzer, Jr. Not like the gazillion character names here could ever be committed to memory, but many are apparently based on real people; Wes Anderson is a longtime fan of New Yorker magazine and has made this film as an homage to its staff writers and editors of yore. This aspect of the film appealed to me, but my problem wasn't with the setup.Some of these individual stories are more fun, more engrossing than others, but little is done to tie them all together and there doesn't always feel like there's a full purpose for their being, except that they're quirky. Some of the characters are delightful - I liked Jeffrey Wright's Roebuck-Baldwin, and Lea Seydoux's prison guard. Tilda Swinton's accent is funny. But for long periods I felt like I wasn't actively engaged in the joy of watching a movie, rather I was submitting to it, which was kind of stifling. I wanted to breathe for a moment, either that or I wanted a bottle of whiskey in the theater with me. The rapid-fire dialogue, voice overs, endless character introductions, story shifts, abrupt transitions between color and black and white, miniature text and title cards - I could go on - felt like one epic introduction to a Wes Anderson film without the lift off. I was overdosing on Anderson pie. It was also officially the first movie where the hypersaturation of perfect symmetry started to put me into seizure, and I wanted to kick his camera out of place, just to change things up a bit.Don't get me wrong, the movie had it moments, and I'm grading this against his other movies. He has set a high bar for himself. But mainly The French Dispatch just wasn't as fun as his other films. The bored, affected quality of the characters grew tiresome, and maybe it's because I had seen so few films in a theater during the pandemic that I was turned off by this, and I wanted to feel something that rose above ennui. Ennui feels gilded and passé for these times, even if this concept was built into the name of the fantasy city here. I also wished for more story, more humanity, to have arose out of the chaos. Without it I was left rudderless.The French Dispatch is certainly Anderson's most artful, adult film - and the first I gather to feature prolonged nudity. By artful I mean there are scenes here with an experimental quality which draw attention to themselves in ways I haven't seen in previous Anderson films, and seem to deliberately throw back to the French New Wave and silent films. I appreciate the nods. And of course the fastidious production design, and his writing are always worthwhile (he'd make for a wonderful novelist or tea shop decorator if he wasn't making films). But it's the first of his movies I've seen since the Life Aquatic that felt like it came and left, and my attention waned.I can't rule out the possibility that it all just went by so fast that I will need to marinate with it a bit, and that with repeated viewings the intended picture will reveal itself to me. This was my first impression. But this film unfortunately didn't leave me feeling that I wanted to return to the theater a second time to sit through it again any time soon.TlDR - if you're a hardcore fan of Anderson, there will be plenty to enjoy here. If you're a casual viewer, you might find yourself lost early on, with little to grip onto.",The French Dispatch

A brilliant piece cinema definitely best seen on the big screen.

1095,41,varun-25071997,"Strong in Aesthetics, Weak In Content",6/10,5 November 2021,"When one goes to a Wes Anderson film, we exactly know what to expect. In French Dispatch, Wes Anderson gives us everything we expect but he seems to have focused too much on aesthetics and less in the script. The film resembles like a spiritual sequel to Grand Budapest Hotel, but lacked it's strong characters and bullet speed screenplay.The French Dispatch is an anthology about 3 segments in a newspaper set in a French town. Each story is something Wes Anderson has never done in his previous films, he tries to convey a political satire which often falls flat. A big star cast wasn't necessary for this film but it had it anyway and many top actors have been grossly under utilized.The biggest plus of French Dispatch is that it has a spectacular production design, original score, cinematography and costumes. The aesthetics test has been passed in flying colours, probably the best we have seen in a Wes Anderson movie. On the first watch the movie rather feels like a letdown compared to his previous work but rewatches could boost it's legacy.",The French Dispatch
1096,42,chong_an,"Quirky, mildly irritating triptych",6/10,23 October 2021,"Using the artifact of multiple stories for a magazine, Wes Anderson glues together 3 stories set in a fictional French town in maybe the mid-20th century.The styles are all over the map. The stories themselves are shown in black-and-white, while action back in the U. S. is in color. One scene is done like a video of a stage play. Another sequence has an animated car chase. Then there is the language. I think the film should be either entirely in English, or have the French characters speak French to each other. However, there are characters who switch back and forth between languages, almost as an attempt to catch audience member napping.While all this is mildly interesting, it is also mildly irritating. This is mostly for Wes Anderson fans.

1098,44,severindringel,"Lacking emotional attachment, but an aesthetic joy",7/10,8 November 2021,"There are only a few directors whose signature is recognisable in their films from minute one. Whether Rushmore, Moonrise Kingdom or The Grand Budapest Hotel - Wes Anderson definitely belongs to this rarity. His new film The French Dispatch is a colourful mix of satire, hurried dialogue and animated sequences. All these elements in one work have never been seen before in Anderson's filmography. Thus, it is true that you've never seen a movie more Wes Anderson than that.The plot, as with most Anderson films, is once again in the background. Nevertheless, it is clear from the message that this is an ode to journalistic work. For in three short stories we accompany various journalists and artists as they interact, research and polarise. The, also an Anderson characteristic, exclusively bizarre characters simultaneously say goodbye with the stories to their magazine French Dispatch, which is retiring from operation after the death of its editor-in-chief. Residing in the small town of Ennui, in the first mini-narrative we get to know the unassuming but at the same time spectacular place because of its aesthetics. A declaration of love to the beauty of France, initiated of course by the Francophile Anderson himself. The journalists' final articles are told to us pictorially, carried by a top-class cast, as in all WA films. Benicio del Toro plays a highly talented but psychopathic and imprisoned artist who draws inspiration from his superior and model Simone (Lea Seydoux) in prison. Acting-wise, these two are definitely the highlight of the film, not only because they have by far the most screen time, but also have the chance to develop something like comprehensible chemistry as the only characters. The story is rounded off by Adrian Brody as a passionate art collector and Tilda Swinton as the investigative journalist. Although she helps us follow the narrative thread, her character comes up short because of her one-dimensionality. In the second story, Timothee Chalamet and Frances McDormand are investigative journalists from different generations with a somewhat perverted attraction. The lack of exposition hurts the story enormously because it is hard to understand or build tension. The same is true in the third and final article, but with a completely new directorial twist and a bravura Jeffrey Wright as a frenzied reporter, this one wakes you up after a very long-winded second act.You can tell The French Dispatch is not a balanced film. Story-wise, it has highs and lows, though here, unfortunately, it's more the latter. If you are not a classic cineaste, you will have a hard time with the film. Even I struggled at times, because although I celebrate such an aesthetic discovery, the script lacks the finishing touches. Moreover, another of Wes Anderson's weaknesses is more apparent than ever in this film: not one of the hundred characters appears often enough or is present enough to even come close to an emotional connection. As a result, The French Dispatch left me very cold in terms of content. However, the oscillation between animation and live-action film, the energetic monologues and dialogues and fabulous camerawork ultimately triggered something in me that leaves me with a satisfied, if not ecstatic, feeling.",The French Dispatch
1099,45,Billiam-4,A typical Wes Anderson joint,6/10,6 November 2021,"A typical Wes Anderson joint, this anthology of diverse journalistic stories, meant as a homage to The New Yorker, is full of exquisite visual compositions and witty moments, but this time around it's all more the director's style and less meaningful content; that said, wouldn't this have been better as a graphic novel, where you could take your time enjoying the singular vignettes?

So beautiful and memorable. And obviously, some storylines are better than others, like the one with Moses and Simone was the story that made the movie.

1101,47,guskeller,Not Anderson's best but still wonderful,9/10,4 November 2021,"Wes Anderson remains a master of his craft. By now, most cinephiles know what to expect from Anderson's films: precise camera framing, expressive colors, whimsical production design, and witty dialogue. While that might be taken for granted by some, it is undeniable that Anderson's movies are consistently great. The French Dispatch is the latest example. Audiences may have become desensitized to Anderson's artistry and it's a bit forgettable by his lofty standards, but The French Dispatch is still one of the best films of the year.Before dismissing it as just another great Wes Anderson movie, a few details about The French Dispatch deserve recognition. First, the script is uniquely structured as a series of magazine articles, connected by themes of the creative process and finding a sense of belonging. Next, there are a variety of effects at play; shifting aspect ratios, color saturation, and animation mediums give the film a dynamic feel. Lastly, the cast is exceptional. Almost every character is played by a recognizable and skilled actor, which helps capture Anderson's quirky world. Overall, it might not be Anderson's best, but The French Dispatch is a wonderful experience.Writing: 9/10

1105,51,AvidWatcher101,Wes Anderson times Wes Anderson,6/10,28 October 2021,"Mr. Anderson is one of my all time favorite directors, having made some of my very favorite and beloved films. This one has its charms.. and its moments. It's a collage of separate stories being covered by different American ex-pat journalists living in France, working for Bill Murray (who instead of going to New York and starting the New Yorker, went to France). The best of these is the Benicio Del Toro/Adrien Brody contribution, which I found riveting and moving and all that it could be. Overall, the film is intelligent - yes, certainly. However, there is a level of pretention and condescension that is really not enjoyable. I think I have come to expect something known from Mr. Anderson - true heart and soul in what may otherwise seem vapid or angry (or otherwise one dimensional) characters, humour, pathos, and something bright - something that gets the serotonin running.. bright colours, bright feelings - something ultimately uplifting. Maybe it's not fair of me to expect more of the same. The artist has to grow and has the right to create.. but as the consumer, I can feel a little disappointed when the flavour is just a bit off. And yet, I would recommend this file and I certainly don't regret seeing it.",The French Dispatch
1106,52,bostonct,A lot of strong performance,8/10,30 October 2021,"Someone already said it, it needs to be seem again as there is just so much content. So many actors had solid contributions in their limited roles. Seydoux was very hard NOT to look at when she was on the screen. However, you do need to be in the mood for this movie. It is like reading the New York Magazine. The NYM is a fun read when you're anticipating all the news, quirks and puns they deliver so you need the same mindset for this movie.

Like other films of his, it's marvellous to look at, there are some funny moments from the huge star studded cast, and despite the reservations mentioned, the French Despatch is classy.

If you go into a Wes Anderson movie, you know that you will experience a weird film, that most likely is all over the place, so in this part it doesnt disappoint.It consists of 3 different short stories, that are (apperently?!) unrelated to each other and unfortunately are played in the complete wrong order, from most entertaining to least.Visually, the movie kicks of with a bang though! I love good credits and the artistic integration of those, unfortunately the quality of the movie doesnt continue to be on this superb level though!Its a movie that leaves you confused for a while.

1112,58,JoelAlexanderr,"A charming, hilarious ode to journalism and storytelling",9/10,9 November 2021,"Wes Anderson movies are a genre of their own at this point. Every shot he composes is uniquely his, and nobody else can seem to replicate his distinct style. Therefore, whenever Anderson is coming out with a new film, I, for one, am there. His new movie, THE FRENCH DISPATCH, may be one of his best yet, and contains some of the most enthralling, off-the-rails and beautiful storytelling of his career and of the year thus far. If Anderson was a new director and this were his first movie, he would be the clear winner for Best Director at the Oscars this year, but because he has established his style in the minds of critics and viewers alike, this is seen as a typical output. Whatever box one may try to put THE FRENCH DISPATCH under, it wildly succeeds as an ode to journalism and the art of storytelling itself. The movie never lost my attention despite being quite a lot of complex dialogue to digest in one sitting, and by the end I felt myself reluctant to leave the world this film had established.The French Dispatch is the title of a small American magazine in France that covers world affairs and a wide array of subjects despite starting out as a branch from a different larger publication in Kansas. It contains an old-fashioned yet passionate editor (Bill Murray in his obligatory role in every Wes Anderson movie), a talented writing staff from all different backgrounds, and a knowledge of the fictional city of Ennui. The film does not follow one storyline, but rather three small stories and plenty more small asides, similar to how the structure of a magazine or similar publication may look. These stories are all completely different and bear no relation other than taking place in the town of Ennui, yet they all capture the essence of the importance of storytelling and journalism in capturing the adventure of life.I'll come out and say that part of my immense appreciation for Anderson's movie is my well-established connection and appreciation for journalism, and many may not feel the same love for the disjointed structure. I can see people who are used to a typical story being overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at them, but for me, THE FRENCH DISPATCH proves to be an immensely enjoyable thrill-ride from start to finish. Even the slower stories feel like a whirlwind of emotion and humor in a way that only Anderson can pull off. In concept, some of the stories may seem uninteresting, but as any good journalist does, Anderson structures and tells his narratives in such a way that every audience member will be on the edge of their seat by the end. While I'm not sure if I picked up every detail on my viewing due to the rapid-fire dialogue, I would not hesitate to travel right back to the town of Ennui and discover even more things I may have overlooked.To say the acting is good in this movie is like saying the grass is green, especially since Anderson has cast every A-list star known to man to star in this film. Every other scene has some ridiculously famous actor appear (Hey, is that Edward Norton?)(Hey, is that Christoph Waltz?)(Hey, is that Elizabeth Moss?)(Hey, is that *insert actor name here*?), which would be distracting if they all weren't so good in their roles. The highlights for me are numerous: Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as a mentally ill, incarcerated art genius; Adrien Brody is charismatic as the art dealer trying to profit from Del Toro's art; Timothée Chalamet wins me over yet again as a stubbornly impassioned student protest leader; and Jeffrey Wright delivers the best performance in the movie as a struggling writer who finds meaning in food. Wright in particular is so excellent that he injects in the story an emotional depth that I did not expect, and also made me look back on the emotional potency of journalism in a different way. This is also due to Anderson's excellent writing, in which he maintains his journalistic integrity of non-bias (""NO CRYING"") while also giving us glimpses of the emotion underneath it all.Saying more about THE FRENCH DISPATCH would be pointless without telling you this: go in expecting a Wes Anderson-esque Wes Anderson movie with copious amounts of Wes Anderson thrown in for good measure. If that doesn't sound like it's for you, then don't bother. If that means nothing to you, then I'd highly suggest watching some more of his films before this one (Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs, or Fantastic Mr. Fox are all great choices), because starting with THE FRENCH DISPATCH is like having your first concert be in the mosh pit for Slipknot -- a bit overwhelming. However, if that description sounds like fun for you, it will be one of your favorite films of the year. THE FRENCH DISPATCH serves as one of the best odes to journalism I have ever laid eyes on, and is a movie that I predict will have great longevity as viewers continue to mine endless amounts of detail and meaning out of this meticulously crafted film.A.",The French Dispatch

All chocolate box surface and pretty icing, but nothing really to hold the attention.

1120,66,adamk-2,An Absolute Treat,10/10,11 October 2021,"I'm not a diehard Wes Anderson fan (I loathed ""The Royal Tannenbaums) but I bloody loved this film. It's a loving tribute to the lost age of journalism, when giants stalked the corridors of The New Yorker, as well as an inventive and inspired paean to the art of storytelling, as plots, subplots and digressions are juggled like plates or nested inside one another like Russian dolls. While there's certainly a surfeit of whimsy and Gallic je ne sais quoi, it's stylish, beautifully photographed and boasts a cast to die for. I wasn't entirely sure why it kept switching from colour to black-and-white, but there are also delightful animated sections, sly humour, dry wit and...oh, so much, it's almost overwhelming and would definitely reward a second look. Great stuff.

You bite into it and it crumbles into pieces immediately. Same with Anderson's latest work.This film is artfully delicious, with delicate set design and camera work, a l'art pour l'art episode movie, a real delight to watch. But- it doesn't offer any content at all. And no characters you can really relate to.Amusing and entertaining, with dozens of brilliant actors enjoying their parts, but not enough to fill your stomach when you're hungry for something more nutritious.

1122,68,suuronenmiro,I absolutely loved this!,10/10,22 October 2021,I was scared about many things like multiple different stories and black & white in this movie.Those all ended up being perfect in this.So unique experience.Like it was most Wes Anderson movie that Wes Anderson movie can be.But still so different.I find it hard to compare this to any other movie.So beautiful looking movie.Those style switches were very well done.Style changes in third story were probably most suprising and creative.I loved all stories.First story was probably my favorite one.I was also surprised how explicit this movie was.I loved how many great actors there were. So many familiar and also unfamiliar faces.Great performances.List would be too long if i would wrote about my favorites.When movie ended my mouth was open and there were couple tears in my eye. But no crying.Or maybe it was crying.I just said out to myself goddammit how great movie this was.As i said it was definitely experience.,The French Dispatch
1123,69,lesdroits,4th grade humor,2/10,28 October 2021,"If a movie makes you laugh by naming a town ""Ennui"", this is a movie for you!. Not even as funny as a silly French farce (although close enough that this must explain the alleged standing ovation at Cannes). Main challenge must have been trying to see how many stars could be worked into the tableaux. I've rarely walked out of movie, but left this movie after an hour and had started wanting to after 15 minutes. Amazingly stupid. Only reason I didn't give it one star is that spot is reserved for the recent movie Black Widow.

1124,70,danielmullin,The Adam Sandler aspect was hilarious,7/10,26 August 2021,"I caught this film at the festival a couple months back. The first two thirds seemed like the usual wes Anderson wackiness. But coming in to the final act they start to bring the Adam Sandler aspect to the film all the jokes about ""wishing Adam Sandler was in the movie"" started to pay off, and then without spoiling too much .......... We finally get Adam Sandler. The Adam Sandler pay off was AMAZING !!! It was built up years ago with the wedding singer and happy Gilmore and Wes Anderson's unique ability to capitalise on that was insane. In conclusion, if you find your self thinking ""I wish Adam Sandler was in this movie"" don't worry, you will be pleased !",The French Dispatch
1125,71,Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos,Is There A Universe That Wes Anderson Doesn't Make A Charming Movie?,8/10,4 October 2021,"This is easily the best movie that I saw during AIFF (Athens International Film Festival).The French Dispatch is an anthology movie that follows three reporters recounting events that led them to write certain articles. As with all Wes Anderson movies, it's unique, visually hilarious without stupid dialogue and a joy to watch. The only downsides are two in my opinion. One, the first story is the best, the second the second best and the third... you get it. This descending order of interest is apparent, but that doesn't means that they are bad. Two, most of the movie is in black and white and when you see colored shots it makes you wish that the whole movie was in color.

1126,72,branflakes4547,Well. It's a Wes Anderson film.,8/10,11 November 2021,"This is definitely one of Anderson's weaker films, and it feels directionless and jumbled at times. But that being said Anderson is STILL evolving as a film maker. It's astounding and this film does not lack visual suprises, deadpan explitives, and many of his now seemingly landmark stage play-esque set direction. Most importantly, the film does not lack emotion, with some genuine tear jerking scenes done in a way only Wes Anderson is capable of. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you probably haven't seen a Wes Anderson film. And if you haven't- What are you doing! Go watch a Wes Anderson film! You will thank yourself for giving truly unique art some of your time. Cheers!

Every scene is polished and nothing is left to imprecision. I was not disappointed.The story revolves around the final issue of the French Dispatch and the loooong string of actors depicting the 3 main sections of it. I recognised 25 of them including some French actors : Guillaume Galliene-delacomediefrancaise (!) Cécile de France, Mathieu Amalric, Hippolite Girardeau, and of course Lea Sedoux. It was like being at a posh festival de Cannes.I loved the quirky town of Ennui sur Blasé which reminded me of my home town (Paris) when I was young. So much details! The old buses the ""égouts"" flowing with the serpillière to constrict the flow of water. Add a bit of Aznavour and ""Aline"" in the soundtrack as well for a bit more retro.So many details!The movie is still a bit lengthy but it's quickly forgotten by the quirky ambiance of this bilingual, black and white/colour 4 1/3 format joy.",The French Dispatch

This movie may be very artistic and beautiful and creative and all that, but there is just not enough plot to hold it together. If you want a bunch of random and pretty scenes strung together, then this is your movie. But if you want something that has some cohesion and a modicum of logic, that a normal person can relate to, then this is not your movie. The narration (and much of the dialogue) is just too stilted to follow. There is a tinge of comedy here, but not enough of it nor enough strength to really make this a comedy. The movie consists of 3 stories, and I was praying that there was not a fourth... Perhaps if you love this director and his style, then this is for you. Not quite getting all the love here....

1132,78,WLRSky,The French Dispatch : My first Wes Anderson film - A bit dull at times but very stylish,7/10,19 November 2021,"November 19, 2021
Written by SkyINTROWes Anderson is a filmmaker that I found interesting. I've never seen his movies before, (until now) but I've always thought his movies looked really stylish from the images and short clips of his movies.TECHNICAL ASPECT & DIRECTINGThe Visuals and directing are the Strongest aspects of this movie. A lot of reviews are saying that this is the Most Wes Anderson-ish movie ever, and I can see that. Almost every shots in the movie feel artsy and have a fairy-tale feel to them. You can feel the talent and craftsmanship behind the camera. The way Anderson places the people and objects in the scenes--- It is beautiful to look at. The cinematography was great.Not only that, this is a very colorful film despite a lot of the parts being black and white. The movie does not feel lifeless at all. There are many moments where the movie transitions from black and white to color (and vice versa) and they felt natural and looked great.The movie adapts a lot of 'Magazine' aesthetics. From the opening titles, transition between stories and the way subtitles appear on screen. It was very pleasing to look at.DIALOGUES & PERFORMANCESThe movie has an Incredible cast, some actors do not have that much screentime compared to others, but IMO all the actors did a good job.The line deliveries in this movie were really fast. And there were a lot of lines. This could work as a flaw for a lot of people, especially people who are watching the movie with subtitles. There are some moments where I struggled to follow the subtitles and I could not appreciate the cinematography because I was so busy reading the subtitles.However those dialogues and narrations were kinda poetic & had a Literature -ish feel to them. It felt like I was reading a book.CHARACTERS & WRITINGThis is a part I had some problems with the movie. While the characters were played by great actors, I felt like the characterization was not enough. I think we could've learned more about these people. And as a result I did not have any strong emotional reaction while I was watching the movie.There are a lot of moments where the movie jumps through many scenes, and I think it was kinda messy at Some moments.CONCLUSIONDespite the fact that I found the movie dull at times due to the lack of characterization, this was a very stylish and pleasing experience. Also it was my introduction to the World of Wes Anderson.Overall, I liked the movie.7/101. Maybe I would like this more when I rewatch this.. if I understand all the lines & notice the details..or would it be more boring the second time?? I don't know.",The French Dispatch
1133,79,tmoser1434,Too much Wes Anderson,7/10,2 November 2021,"On a technical level, The French Dispatch is creatively designed from the sets to the film's structure. On an emotional level, the film fails to connect, while throwing so much on screen information and characters, it almost becomes too much to handle on a single viewing.

1135,81,eevaivilo,The most Wes Anderson movie Wes Anderson has ever made,9/10,19 October 2021,"I suppose my only qualm with this movie is that it's very talky (as many of his films are), and if you have a short attention span like myself, it can be easy to miss important dialogue. I had to ask the friend I was with for explanation on one or two things I didn't fully comprehend. However, once you really immerse yourself in the world of the film, you'll miss less and less.This film was an absolute delight from start to finish. I thought each of the three stories were captivating in their own, unique way (though I definitely liked Chalamet's the most), and the bookends about Murray's character tied everything together perfectly.Anderson has this marvelous talent for luring you into his fantastical films with unbelievable set design and whimsical details and oddly delightful performances, and then hitting you over the head with reality. There are plenty of moments in this film that truly struck me in a profound way, especially one during story two that included a stellar performance from Alex Lawther, who expertly utilized what little screen time he had. One line of dialogue still haunts me hours later.It's also one of his funniest movies; the absurdity of some of the visuals and performances are really a sight to behold. The cartoon sections in the third story had me ROLLING for a good few minutes.So go see it. It's wildly original and has that trademark Wes Anderson touch dialed up to 11.",The French Dispatch
1136,82,laurenjfree,A Wes Anderson Fans Dream,9/10,26 October 2021,"After leaving the theatre I am having a Wes Anderson overload. By far the writer/ directors most ambitious project. I really do understand the criticism, but in the words of Rhett Butler ""Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn""! This was an absolute joy to watch. A meticulously intricate set design and great performances by a stellar cast pulled the story from the pages, and gave it a heartbeat.All that being said, it is not without its flaws. The French Dispatch lacked a human element. Unlike the rest of his films, the movie was not rooted in family relationships, which is something I've always admired in his stories. However, this did not bother as much as it did other people. The French Dispatch is an absolute blast and a nice change from the boring, overdone Oscar bait movies that always come out in the fall.

1137,83,sebastianschlicht,"""Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose.""",10/10,5 November 2021,"Wes Anderson is loved by many and disdained by others. ""Typical Wes Anderson"" or ""Always the same"" is read and / or heard quite often. At the end of the day, what counts for me is whether a film entertains and / or touches me. And Anderson has always managed to do that. Even if a film uses its style repeatedly and one might think that he cannot do anything else, one must not overlook what he achieves with its work. The visual, which he often seems to focus on, is a very special level of storytelling. But many then rate it with a simple ""Style over Substance"". I'd would say something like that about someone like Michael Bay, but not Anderson. He's far too talented for that.His latest film ""The French Dispatch"" from 2021 has already received a lot of reviews such as ""a typical Anderson"", but is it really that way?The story revolves around editor Arthur Howitzer or rather his journalists, who present three of their stories: An imprisoned murderer and painter who discovers his new muse in a guard, a war between two student fronts and the story about a kidnapped child and the best chef in the world ...""The French Dispatch"" is therefore more of an anthology film and consists of three episodes plus a prologue and an epilogue. The whole thing takes place in the fictional french suburb of Ennui-sur-Blasé and is a kind of love letter (or film) from Anderson to France, where he himself spent many years of his life. But of course he creates his very own, magical world that seems to have sprung from a fairy tale. But how do you describe such a film? How do you describe ""The French Dispatch""?Anderson brings everything he has tot he table, he brought almost every actor into the film he has ever worked with and still creates something unique and new. His loving homage to France and journalism develops into a turbulent trip, which at first glance has a very simple story or three simple stories to offer, but which transforms the whole thing into a moving picture book. Even if you can't quite follow the story, the immense imagery offers a lot of entertainment. Every shot is detailed, wonderfully filmed and looks like a small painting. A comic that has become real, as it is called in the film itself. Anderson uses almost no CGI, but rather loving miniatures, cartoon animation and even stop motion. The sets are superbly designed and you can tell that every setting, every zoom and every edit has its purpose. The constant change between black and white and color is also very noticeable here.But Anderson also manages the change between joke and tragedy so brilliantly. The humor is often the focus (it´s a very funny movie), but there is always something melancholy and sentimental about it. And that has always touched me emotionally. So I was able to laugh much more at all the crazy, but charming things.Anderson naturally incorporated the french culture, as well as real french locations and extras. The spectacular 2D chase in the final, for example, was also animated in France. So the country had a strong influence on the finished film. But in the end ""The French Dispatch"" cannot really be described, because it is one of those films that you have to see and experience for yourself. Like a picture you cannot describe, you cannot describe this work of art either. And just like the works of art by Moses Rosenthaler in the film, you can't see everything at first glance, but you still somehow see the masterpiece.The cast is bigger than ever. It would be ridiculous to name everyone here, because even the smallest roles are always filled with top-class talent. I recommend not to read through the cast, because every new appearance is a little surprise. Still, I have to highlight Benicio del Toro, whose performance I probably enjoyed the most. I just love that, despite this gigantic number of great actors, the magic of the film doesn't disappear. Everyone does their part, like an ensemble in a play. And the fun and dedication of the actors can always be seen. There is so much passion in here that it is difficult to avoid it as a viewer.In addition to the breathtaking camera work by Robert Yeoman and the phenomenal editing by Andrew Weisblum, the whole thing is held together by the again wonderful music by Alexandre Desplat. His scores for Anderson's films always have this relaxed, playful and melancholy nature. I'm really looking forward to the soundtrack for this.Conclusion: After the first look, you might ask yourself what all this was about? Granted, a lot happens in a relatively short amount of time. Personally, I see it as an encouragement to watch the film several times, not at least to dive back into this unique world. And in my opinion, Anderson can do that like no other. He creates a fictional world that is similar to ours, but more reminiscent of a fairy tale. A modern fairy tale with a lot of humor and emotions under it. The two are so masterfully brought together that any other Hollywood-comedy feels like a visit to the cemetery. Another Anderson masterpiece in my eyes that can deliver a completely different experience for every viewer.",The French Dispatch

1139,85,cmantafounis,The French Dispatch,8/10,2 November 2021,"At some point I would love to read (or write, but it would be more preferable to leave it to those more informed than I; namely, anyone else) an essay on the phenomenon of artistic self-parody - likely observable in most forms, but particularly present within film. Regularly do auteurs reach a point of such notoriety and acclaim that they resort to attempting to recapture their earlier work, shaping their newer projects to suit the public or critical perception of what their films ""should"" be. The result is often an ungainly amalgam of all the artist's trademarks, overtly portentous in its conceit as some sort of magnum opus. The examples are numerous: Lynch's Inland Empire, Tarkovsky's Nostalghia, even Nolan's Tenet. Wes Anderson has reached this inevitable step with his latest, The French Dispatch. As such, viewers are likely to be polarised between smitten awe at his generous display of stylistic idiosyncrasies (black-and-white, colour, animation, changing aspect ratios, dynamic camerawork, perfectly symmetrical staging, aggressively witty dialogue, et al), or utterly disenfranchised at the sight of this mechanical recitation of his defining tropes. I fall largely into the former category, albeit occasionally off-put by the usual issues that come with anthology films (viz. Superior segments highlighting weaknesses of others, lack of overarching purpose, difficulty to establish an emotional through-line, etc.; though many of these don't apply here, or at least not entirely, and the palpable craft and detail on display won me over on second viewing just as effectively as the first.) All this to say that The French Dispatch is Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson, a wonderful thing if one is a fan of Wes Anderson. The fact that I struggle to pick a favourite segment is a positive sign (perhaps the first story, if only for my deep love of Tilda Swinton), and the entire runtime is just gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot, the cast listing overflowing with star talent, the score delightful throughout, the dialogue suitably charming, and pacing frantic enough that repeat watches allow for new jokes to be uncovered. Wall-to-wall with references, most of which I did not get as someone unfamiliar with the French New Wave, yet I can't help but smile even when it is clear he is writing well over my head. Perhaps lacks the sentimental counter-balance of e.g. Fantastic Mr. Fox (for the most part; each section ends with a moment that affected me in some respect - the longing final look between an artist and his muse, the elegy for a young rebel and his naïve cause, the reflections of a chef after tasting poison, and the last scene) but still a blast from start to finish. Currently my film of the year.",The French Dispatch
1140,86,frankperkins-76225,"Seen one, seen them all",7/10,28 October 2021,"Wes Anderson is in acquired taste, and his movies are not for everyone. My sister and I can watch his movies all day, and cry and laugh at the same time. My other one will look at us, and say, ""This was really not that good."" Anderson's style is the same in every movie. It starts with quirky humor, and ends with this bitingly sad, philosophical ending. The last movie of his that I truly enjoyed was The Darjeeling Limited. Either he has lost his touch, or the repetition does drive one to think why you are watching this to begin with?Is this a bad movie? No, but go in knowing that if you have seen one, you have seen them all.

It's not his best, but some folk seem reluctant to see this.

1143,89,FelixisaJerk,"Basically if you don't like Anderson's style you're really, truly going to hate this movie.",8/10,26 October 2021,"I suppose the gamble of any film told in a series of vignettes is to capture the rapt attention of your audience in one segment only to lose it in the next (see: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs).None of the vignettes in The French Dispatch ever truly lost me, but one came close. And it's not to say that particular story was poorly written or directed or performed, it's simply that the one preceding it was so dazzling and fantastic I wasn't quite ready to move on from it.Moving on is a large part of this film as it never stops marching forward both literally and figuratively. It has (a) large story(ries) to get through and if you can't keep up...sorry. No crying.The French Dispatch is a film told in five parts. Three articles bookended by an introduction and an epilogue. These five pieces make up the final issue of the magazine titled (wait for it): The French Dispatch. We ""read"" the final issue by watching the articles unfold through Wes Anderson's beautiful, obsessive, whimsical lens.Visually this is an Anderson film cranked to 11. The photogenic establishing shots, contrasting symmetry, and pastel color scheme of his entire career drenches every shot of this film. The picture beautifully shifts from black and white to color, and always at the perfect moment. His creative and effective use of animation and miniature sets are mesmerizing.Basically if you don't like Anderson's style you're really, truly going to hate this movie, but your mind was probably already made up.Seeing this in a theater packed full of micro-beanie, gold wire framed glasses wearing hipsters reminded me of why I don't typically like seeing Anderson's films on opening weekends. There is exactly one reason to ever talk during a movie, and that's if there is a fire, after that there is not one good reason to ever speak in a theater, especially if you're talking directly to the screen which a handful of these people did.The French Dispatch is an excellent film and Anderson is an excellent filmmaker. I think his style and creativity are a much needed burst of originality on the canvas of filmmaking. It also just made me feel nice after watching The Last Duel, that movie stole a piece of my soul... I like unconventional filmmakers, I like divisive filmmakers, and even in his missteps, I'll continue to be excited by and support Wes Anderson.",The French Dispatch
1144,90,hugh-33-58009,For Wes fans only.,5/10,11 November 2021,"Feels like an overlong parody of a Wes Anderson movie. Inventive and beautifully shot with great actors. Some funny bits. But more precious than compelling and there are no real characters - just a collection of weird archetypes. Sadly, watchable for fans but most others will merely find it annoying.

1145,91,Airman87,Wes Anderson Turned Up To 11,8/10,7 November 2021,"Wes Anderson delivers his trademark style in arguably the largest magnitude yet. This is Wes in full control, delivering an intellectual feast of witty dialogue, cinematic art, sumptuous prop making, and possibly his most dynamic ensemble.Notably absent in The French Dispatch, unlike Anderson's works The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom, is any sincerity or heart taken to the subject matter. This may leave some viewers angry at the superficial world Wes lives in, but it is entertainment, after all. One technical fault I personally had issue with is a couple disjointed animation sequences in the third story, which I cannot help but feel are anything other than budget cuts - particularly as one animated sequence is the biggest action scene within the whole film.Be that as it may, this is still the most Wes Anderson of Wes Anderson films. Where exactly it ranks among his other works will be largely up to the viewer.",The French Dispatch
1146,92,josiahliljequist,Art underscoring how art sustains,7/10,30 October 2021,"One of my favorite lines in poetry is Keats' ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever...some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits.""
And I think this movie is Wes Anderson's way of recapitulating that sentiment on film.Each story shows the transcendence of art, beauty, and love in different ways. In ""The Concrete Masterpiece,"" the prisoner Moses staves off thoughts of suicide by delving into pottery, and eventually art. Simone is the beautiful muse that inspires him in spite of himself, and through her artistic spirit he lives on--both in his final work of art and in simply staying alive.In ""Revisions to a Manifesto,"" revolutionary wannabe Zeffirelli finds solace from the confused turmoil of a ambiguous revolution through the brief interlude of love that he finds with his fellow (and rival) compadre Julliette. It's the only time things slow down, and the scene is allowed to breathe, showing the calm that love brings in sharp contrast to the chaos of war.In ""The Commissioner's Dining Room,"" chef Nescaffier saves a boy's life through serving poisonous radishes to the kidnappers, and in doing so he must test it and poison himself. He ultimately survives, but he reveals that the poisoned radishes had a new flavor, something exceedingly rare in his long experience as a chef. Even in the face of death, the sensual art of food was something that enlightened him, something that proved transcendent over possible death.Now this doesn't mean the film doesn't have its flaws. It does. The narration can be frustrating, especially when one wants to simply soak in the gorgeous cinematography that Wes Anderson employs. The vignettes are mostly stand alone, and have no culminating element that ties the whole thing together. Except the beauty in art. The theme of art and love (and love for art) transcending all else, a fitting theme for a love letter to France.So overall, I really liked it. Its emotions are not in the actors, the lines, but in the underlying theme of art and beauty sustaining us through dark times, something portrayed beautifully by all the gorgeous scenes strung together like a jeweled necklace.",The French Dispatch

I will watch it again on the small screen to get more of what I missed on the big screen bc I went to the bathroom or became a little tired trying to figure it out. It is DADA live or something just charming and challenging from beginning to end - I think.

All of this movie is on the surface. My husband and I wanted to leave after 15 minutes but stuck it out through the tedium and self-indulgence until about 40 minutes and then walked. All sorts of things just happened with no apparent reason. It seemed like it was written by a half dozen giggling tweens. Ultimately, I don't believe there's any there there. I did not get involved in the story, nor did I care. It's $25 million spent on eye candy. Kudos to production design.

1150,0,SnoopyStyle,slow burn,6/10,22 September 2021,"Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Burbank (Jesse Plemons) are brothers leading a cattle drive in Montana. There is some unspoken tension between them. It's been 25 years since their first drive in 1900. George is taken with Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst) who gets belittled by Phil. George later marries her. Phil calls her the ""suicide widow"". Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is her awkward son.This is a Jane Campion film. It's a slow burn especially in the first half. While I find these characters compelling, I do wish to have more reasons for these characters. I need their history. I do wonder if I missed something in the movie or if the book gives more meat to the bone. It's a movie of quiet beauty and an emotional volcano underneath the surface. It does have to hit its audience at the right angle. For me, the start is too slow and the movie struggles to gain speed.

1151,1,nogodnomasters,I can't play,4/10,28 September 2021,"The film takes place in 1925 on a cattle ranch in Montana. It was filmed in New Zealand which gave me LOTR flashbacks. Two brothers are ranchers. Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a man's man who loving call his brother George (Jesse Plemons) Fatso. George marries a local widow (Kirsten Dunst) who has a son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) that makes flowers out of paper. Phil is hard on both, but eventually befriends the son to the dismay of his mother.This is a western drama about relationships and not really a western other than the fact it pretends to take place in Montana.

1152,2,CinemaSerf,A bit of a non-movie that ends cleverly.,6/10,20 November 2021,"Brothers ""Phil"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) and ""George"" (Jesse Plemons) are the bit chalk-and-cheese brothers who own a successful cattle ranch. On a trip to town, ""Phil"" upsets the owner of the hotel ""Rose"" (an effective Kirstin Dunst) after he rather cruelly insults her extremely svelte teenage son ""Peter"" (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who had taken some care to prepare intricate paper decorations for their dining table. We don't know how long ""George"" and ""Rose"" have been friends, but next thing we know they are married and the pretty unpleasant ""Phil"" sets out to make her life as miserable as possible. He is never overtly cruel - there is no violence, but mental abuse that sends her seeking solace in the bottle. When her son joins them from school, he fixes him fairly and squarely in his sights too - introducing a hint of homo-eroticism and scheming to the last fifteen minutes that makes you sit up. Again, no action as such - there are no gunfights or fisticuffs, just a cleverly structured denouement that I felt fitting. The pace is really slow, the dialogue pretty laconic, Cumberbatch's accent is all over the place and the score becomes wearisome after a while - the sounds of the constant high pitched violins really did begin to grate. It is a lovely film to look at, plenty of attention to the detail, but it is altogether just a bit so what.",The Power of the Dog
1153,3,MOscarbradley,Possibly the best film of the year.,10/10,16 October 2021,"I hope the uncalled for comparisons with ""Heaven's Gate"" and, for that matter, ""Brokeback Mountain"" don't hurt the chances of ""The Power of the Dog"" doing well, either at the box-office or come awards season. This is Jane Campion's first feature film since ""Bright Star"" twelve years ago and it may be a masterpiece. It's a 'contemporary' western in that it's set in 1925 and is about two brothers, both ranchers, one 'good', (Jesse Plemons), and one 'bad', (Benedict Cumberbatch), and what happens when Plemons brings home a new wife, (Kirsten Dunst), and her teenage son, (Kodi Smit-McPhee).It's a slow, visually stunning, (Ari Wegner is the DoP), character-driven piece written by Campion from Thomas Savage's novel and it deals with both the themes of revenge and redemption. Cumberbatch may appear to be the conventional villain but it's clear quite early on there are a great deal more shadings to his character and Cumberbatch is superb in a role he took over from Paul Dano. Plemons, on the other hand, never quite develops beyond being the decent family man though both Dunst and Smit-McPhee are excellent.You could say the other major 'character' in the film is the house where they live. A great gothic pile standing in the middle of nowhere, (the film was shot in the vast open spaces of New Zealand standing in for Montana), this house is as memorable as those in ""Giant"" and ""Days of Heaven"". As with all of Campion's films nothing here is rushed. This is no more an action film than something Terrence Malick might turn out, (Malick is another point of reference), and consequently will be more suited to the art-house than the multiplex but in its simple, direct and unadorned way it's as good as anything you will see this year and it shouldn't be missed.",The Power of the Dog

Its a 2 brother drama, much like kain and abel caracters, as one being sweet and careful, and the other just filled with silly old grumpiness and an, at that time, rather unheard of devotion towards same sex or being drawn to men. When romace comes into the nice brothers life things get even worse, in a complicated and elussive manner, and the story, plot and musical score is made to make you feel uncomfortable all the way to a bitter end.Its probably a book made into a movie, with a production level at the higher level, but the audiences being satisfied from this fairytail, cant be of the large kind. Mr cumberbachts inovative rawhide temper will dissapoint many, but hes doing it good though, and mrs dunst hasnt reached much longer than the spiderman roles she used to play. And to round up the acts, mr plemmons is at his homefield getting this role, as calm careful, naive and non advetourous, a nick nack caracter that he usually has done in past presences.Scenicly its brilliantly shot, nature barren lands have got its story told and the dark wave sensation youll get will hang in there in the aftermath, much thanks to some awly and dark cello music always in thereso as a drama it delivers, its not a wild wst flick in the good old way, and its far from comedy as you can get.

The great star of this film is the Montana High Prairie, butting into the hills and bluffs which sidle up to the Rockies. Herds of cattle trek along a ridge with the continental divide and the Montana big skies behind them. This and the concentration on nature be it rabbits, deer, horses, cattle or even humans in all of their strengths and frailities is highlighted by the cinematography of Ari Wegner. TPOTD will soon stream on Netflix but is worth watching on a big screen to fully appreciate these vistas. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemon)s are brothers in their 40s, they run a ranch and are close, sharing a bedroom even though they live in a large house. Phil is rough and uncouth in contrast to the mannered George who dresses as a prosperous rancher even when working. Phil upsets the sensitive Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a waiter at his mother Rose's (Kirsten Dunst) eating house. George is taken to Rose and they end up marrying. Phil resents this and makes life a misery for Rose, literally driving her to drink. Peter, now at medical school comes to the ranch for summer and is mocked by Phil and his ranch hand cronies. After an incident Phil seems to take a shine to Peter though.A film of powerful emotions, maternal love, filial loyalty and more dominate the film. Phil worships the memory of Bronco Henry who taught him all that he knows about ranching, he even keeps Henry's saddle as a shrine. His dislike of Rose extends to misogyny , the reasons for this ar payed out as the narrative unfolds. Phil's secrets explain some of this, he carries out rituals in a hidden creek, part of his life is suppressed. Rose's strengths are undermined not just by Phil but by her own actions when drunk. George's ambitions are also hampered by Phil's bitterness. The interplay of tensions is literally Shakespearean as the egos clash and Peter reveals unexpected strengths. Writer/Director Jane Campion even manages to include a piano in this tale of the dying days of the Old West. 9/10.",The Power of the Dog

IDK if the son (Peter, who is studying to be a doctor) ended Phil, or if Phil contracted the infection when he was castrating the bull, which is when he was cut. I have a hunch, that Peter could be getting rid of these men, so that him and his mother (played by Dunst) can live happily ever after. Of their new wealth.",The Power of the Dog

My Rating 10/10
It's very rare for me to score a movie 10/10 last time it was was for Nomadland in 2020.The Power of the Dog is Jane Campion's first movie since Bright Star 2009 and in my view a masterpiece or to put it more simply put an emotional lasagne .I was captivated by the look of the movie, by the score of the movie and most of all by the storyline and performances.Jane Campion has brilliantly written a powerful Screenplay adapted from the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage set in 1925 Montana about two very different men both ranchers , Phil Burbank a volatile bully and George Burbank his kind and sensitive brother who Phil taunts about his weight calling him fatso.A chasm between the two men forms when George marries widow Rose Gordon and moves to their ranch with her effete teenage son Peter . Phil channels all his anger jealousy and resentment toward Rose who has taken his place of control over his brother and her son Peter challenges his perception of masculinity .In Peter, Phil smells wounded prey. He jeers at the kid and encourages his ranch hands to join in . If your latent-homosexuality alert hasn't gone off yet, it may be time to calibrate the settings. Rose his new sister in law is his real target though Phil shows her nothing but rejection taunting her and eroding her confidence even mocking her modest piano playing so much so that at a special dinner attended by the Governor when Rose is asked to play she freezes and this tune becomes a sinister musical motif for Phil's tormenting of Rose .Of course Phil Burbank the emotionally crippled Montana Rancher is t's Benedict Cumberbatch's best film role so far as if he doesn't get Best Actor Oscar next year there is something drastically unfair with the awards system .I haven't seen as intense a performance from an Actor since Daniel Day- Lewis in There Will Be Blood 2007) or Joaquin Phoenix in Joker . 2019 and both those actors deservedly won the Best Actor Academy Award.However there are two other brilliant performances at least in this film that had me enthralled and fascinated and they nearly didn't happen.Elizabeth Moss who starred in Jane Campion's great crime mystery television series Top of The Lake (2013 -2017) was scheduled to play the depressive fragile widow Rose Gordon who marries into the wealthy Burbank Montana ranching family headed by her austere brother in law Phil. Elizabeth Moss dropped out of the project and Kirsten Dunst replaced her. As much as I admire Elizabeth Moss I think Kirsten Dunst has ""struck gold in them there hills "" she's sensational ! I can't say too much about her character as this could spoil the film but to see her transform from a confident young business woman living with her son and managing a diner to a broken and bullied woman whose cruelly taunted by her jealous hateful brother in law is a masterclass in acting Elizabeth Moss may regret leaving this project.The other replacement in this movie was Jesse Plemons who is Kirsten Dunst's partner in real life . The benign Burbank brother of George who marries Rose was given to Paul Dano but he also dropped out of the movie due to the interruption to the film due to COVID.Peter the son , an effete early twenty something undergrad ,who tiptoes into the mud-smeared surroundings like a sickly, gangly cherub, is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who also gives a superb performance and turns out to have more intelligence and human understanding than anyone gives him credit for.Power of the Dog is an international co-production between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Peter Jackson used the south Island of New Zealand for outdoor locations for his Lord of the Rings Trilogy remember the snow and ice of Middle Earth well Jane Campion has used similar locations in the South Island to convincingly represent 1925 Montana .The Sun drenched Mountains the Cattle Drives the dust and The Burbank Ranch are beautifully captured by Cinematographer Ari Wenger and set designers Amber Richards and Gareth Edwards .Filming began in New Zealand on January 10, 2020 in the southern region of Otago, including the city of Dunedin. Production on the film was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although Cumberbatch, Dunst and Plemons reportedly remained in New Zealand during the country's lockdown. After border exemptions were granted for cast and crew, production resumed on June 22, 2020.I really loved this intense and moving film and can only recommend that you see it on a Cinema screen it's too intimate and thoughtful work of Art to be paused on hold while you get a coffee it would break the emotional thread that holds Jane Campion's vision together.",The Power of the Dog

Rose his new sister in law is his real target though Phil shows her nothing but rejection taunting her and eroding her confidence even mocking her modest piano playing so much so that at a special dinner attended by the Governor when Rose is asked to play she freezes and this tune becomes a sinister musical motif for Phil's tormenting of Rose .Of course Phil Burbank the emotionally crippled Montana Rancher is t's Benedict Cumberbatch's best film role so far as if he doesn't get Best Actor Oscar next year there is something drastically unfair with the awards system .I haven't seen as intense a performance from an Actor since Daniel Day- Lewis in There Will Be Blood 2007) or Joaquin Phoenix in Joker . 2019 and both those actors deservedly won the Best Actor Academy Award.However there are two other brilliant performances at least in this film that had me enthralled and fascinated and they nearly didn't happen.Elizabeth Moss who starred in Jane Campion's great crime mystery television series Top of The Lake (2013 -2017) was scheduled to play the depressive fragile widow Rose Gordon who marries into the wealthy Burbank Montana ranching family headed by her austere brother in law Phil. Elizabeth Moss dropped out of the project and Kirsten Dunst replaced her. As much as I admire Elizabeth Moss I think Kirsten Dunst has ""struck gold in them there hills "" she's sensational ! I can't say too much about her character as this could spoil the film but to see her transform from a confident young business woman living with her son and managing a diner to a broken and bullied woman whose cruelly taunted by her jealous hateful brother in law is a masterclass in acting Elizabeth Moss may regret leaving this project.The other replacement in this movie was Jesse Plemons who is Kirsten Dunst's partner in real life . The benign Burbank brother of George who marries Rose was given to Paul Dano but he also dropped out of the movie due to the interruption to the film due to COVID.Peter the son , an effete early twenty something undergrad ,who tiptoes into the mud-smeared surroundings like a sickly, gangly cherub, is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who also gives a superb performance and turns out to have more intelligence and human understanding than anyone gives him credit for.Power of the Dog is an international co-production between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Peter Jackson used the south Island of New Zealand for outdoor locations for his Lord of the Rings Trilogy remember the snow and ice of Middle Earth well Jane Campion has used similar locations in the South Island to convincingly represent 1925 Montana .The Sun drenched Mountains the Cattle Drives the dust and The Burbank Ranch are beautifully captured by Cinematographer Ari Wenger and set designers Amber Richards and Gareth Edwards .Filming began in New Zealand on January 10, 2020 in the southern region of Otago, including the city of Dunedin. Production on the film was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although Cumberbatch, Dunst and Plemons reportedly remained in New Zealand during the country's lockdown. After border exemptions were granted for cast and crew, production resumed on June 22, 2020.I really loved this intense and moving film and can only recommend that you see it on a Cinema screen it's too intimate and thoughtful work of Art to be paused on hold while you get a coffee it would break the emotional thread that holds Jane Campion's vision together.",The Power of the Dog

That's been hammered home for half an hour - which seemed like three.There's no mystery, no suspense; just Phil being nasty.By Part III, it's pretty plain that Nasty Phil is nothing more than nasty. Fine, that's established. By this time I had lost interest in whether Phil lived, died, or jumps a horse through a ring of fire.

1162,12,MrDHWong,A well-acted but otherwise mediocre western that does little to reinvigorate the genre,5/10,16 September 2021,"""The Power of the Dog"" is a western drama film based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and directed by Jane Campion (The Piano), it's a well-acted but otherwise mediocre western that does little to reinvigorate the genre.In 1925, the Burbank brothers Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemons) run a successful cattle ranch in Montana. One day while heading toward the markets, the brothers stop by a restaurant operated by the recently widowed Rose (Kirsten Dunst) and her son Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The hot-headed Phil treats the mother and son pair cruelly but the kind-hearted George feels drawn towards Rose, culminating in a romantic relationship and eventually marriage. Refusing to accept them into the family, Phil continues his mistreatment of Rose and Pete until he soon sees the value in taking the latter under his wing as a new protégé.There haven't been too many good Western films made recently. The genre is growing stale and feels as though it is on its way out. It also doesn't help that it has already been combined with virtually every other genre imaginable ranging from horror to science fiction. A film like ""The Power of the Dog"" attempts to go for a relatively straightforward Western experience with its basic setting on a ranch but it ultimately falls short of greatness.Although I wouldn't exactly call it boring, I didn't find myself particularly invested in the story. The basic plot is just the Burbank brothers working on their ranch with the occasional angry outburst from Phil. The stark contrast between Phil's overtly aggressive demeanour and George's gentle nature is never properly explored. It is hinted that they have inherited the ranch from their father but aside from that, we are never told important background information about what they were like before his passing. This is a missed opportunity as I wish we could have seen which of the brothers takes after their father the most. A plotline involving the siblings competing with each other over which of them is more worthy of being in charge of the family business would have made for a much more interesting film, however, the two of them are shown to get along reasonably well. Even with Phil's outward hostility towards Rose and Pete isn't enough to put a strain on the brothers' familial closeness. Instead, George just seems to brush it off as a minor inconvenience.Jane Campion, who wrote and directed the 1993 classic ""The Piano"", tries her hand here with the Western genre. She shows the vast sweeping landscape of the American mid-west and some creative camera angles to emphasise how small humans look in comparison. Unfortunately, moments like this are so fleeting that they barely leave an impact. Each time it seemed like the film was about to blow me away with epic visuals, the scene would abruptly end. It's a huge shame because I loved how Campion was able to immerse the audience in colonial era New Zealand in ""The Piano"" so it's surprising she wasn't able to replicate similar techniques here. I'm not sure if it's her inexperience with Westerns in general or if she's just simply lost her way over the years but I felt underwhelmed with what she presented to us here.One of the few redeeming features of this film is the quality of its acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty convincing as a ranch owner with a short temper. Even though his character seemed underwritten, I liked what Cumberbatch was able to do with the material given to him. His unpredictability was one of the main reasons the film wasn't a total bore, as it kept me in suspense over what he would do next. Additionally, his American accent has improved considerably over the years, not at all sounding slightly British like it used to in the past. He also shared decent chemistry with Jesse Plemons as his brother, but as I mentioned earlier, I wish the film did a better job at exploring the fraternal relationship between the two of them.In conclusion, ""The Power of the Dog"" simply doesn't do enough to help revitalise the dying Western genre. Though there's nothing outright terrible about it, as there are some things that prevent the film from being a complete failure, there's nothing really worth recommending either. Coming from an otherwise talented filmmaker like Jane Campion, this is especially disappointing.I rate it 5/10.",The Power of the Dog
1163,13,PedroPires90,Strong study,8/10,28 October 2021,"A strong character study focusing mainly on the masculinity concept (and reasons to adopt different attitudes towards it), past, acceptance (by yourself, but also by the others) and how to deal with your insecurities. All the main characters are seen through these lens and the film is very efficient on that. Fantastic direction and cinematography and great acting overall, but especially by Cumberbatch and Dunst.Only cons? Personally, I felt the ending rushed, but that was clearly the option and I can understand why that was the choice. My main concern was that the film opened too many doors and some themes weren't enough explored, with no closure or a deeper analysis about them.Either way, a very good film.

1164,14,sweidman-28016,Mesmerizing Mind Games,9/10,27 October 2021,"""A man's made by patience and the odds against him.""Charismatic rancher Phil Burbank inspires fear and awe in those around him. When his brother brings home a new wife and her son, Phil torments them until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love. The Power of the Dog is Jane Campion's latest feature film and it's magnificent! I was able to see an advanced screening of this at the Chicago International Film Festival a day or two after it's big premiere here. Going in, I had slight skepticisms based on what people were saying about it after the big film festival premieres the past couple of months. Even before its trailer release, almost everyone predicted it as the best picture frontrunner. And though I'm not quite sure it'll take the big win, there is no way this will miss out on much (unless the forces of mainstream audiences, who will most likely find it too slow and strange, make it miss the chance). Jane Campion writes and directs this with subtext. Nothing is ever said plainly. We have to piece together what it's trying to say or what happened that wasn't necessarily shown the way it happened. If you've ever watched A Streetcar Named Desire (and you should!) this is a good comparison film. The film turns from a slow-burn drama into a psychological ""thriller"" of mind games. The way the film diverges into this on-edge atmosphere worked with me in such a manner that I forgot I was sitting in a theater. Campion's writing is very good and could honestly win adapted screenplay among multiple critic bodies and awards circuits. Lines stick with you well after their said. Even the trailer showcases great dialogue. Basically, Campion knew exactly what she was making front start to finish.Followed by her amazing writing and directorial skills, the performances are the next best thing here. Benedict Cumberbatch will be the most talked about part of the film. He's so intimidating and mysterious. By far his best work yet and it will be hard to top himself. He's such a mean person, but when the moment comes that you realize what has caused him to act in such a way, everything comes together and you have to think for yourself whether you like him or not. Kodi Smit-McPhee is the surprise star to emerge. His career has been quiet, but never disappoints. Peter is the most most relatable character within the story and I don't think audiences will have a problem connecting with him. The buzz will come for him, though I'm not quite sure what they'll do with it. And then there's Kirsten Dunst. This role is like a return to acting sort of thing. Everybody knows her and recognizes her as a great actress, but since Melancholia talk about her has ceased. Well, she's really good in here. Rose transforms heavily throughout. She's a very sweet woman, but as Cumberbatch's Phil attempts to drive her insane, she switches into something unforeseen. Jesse Plemons starts out fairly prominent but his screen time diminishes. Still, good work from him. The other two characters of the film are the cinematography and score. This isn't shot like another western. We get those beautiful landscapes and cattle shots, but it's rich in style and beauty. I love what they show and what they don't. Then, Jonny Greenwood (going for a double nomination this year with Spencer as the other) makes such an unsettling a beautiful score. It's not what you'd expect to hear going in, but as it starts and continues throughout the film (and there's lots of it), you see the character that it is. Besides a strange way to start and an abrupt moment towards the end, The Power of the Dog blew me away more than I expected. Will this be for everyone? No. You can't expect a western, but you can expect some of those elements. What the film is about is what it takes to go mad with power. Check it out on Netflix this winter!",The Power of the Dog

It could have been edited a bit tighter as there some pace drop-offs, but when you think about the setting and cast ability you can understand the reasoning. Campion's vision of Montana is beautiful, although it's actually New Zealand, sorry Montanans.

1167,17,gsygsy,"High calibre, without a gun in sight",9/10,15 October 2021,"Film adaptations of novels can be weighed down by their literary origins, but not this one. Thanks to Jane Campion's skills as a writer-director, this is cinema of the highest calibre.A tale of dangerous repression and emotional manipulation, the tension in the telling is almost tangible. Campion achieves this without resorting to melodrama, but by sheer intensity. The quartet of leading actors is unbeatable, with revelatory performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst. They are well matched by Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee, in less rangy but nevertheless demanding roles.Campion has, as ever, brought the best out of her collaborators, notably cinemtographer Ari Wegner and editor Peter Sciberras. The magnificant score, a classic if ever there was one, is by Jonny Greenwood.

1169,19,MogwaiMovieReviews,"One Part Piano, Two Parts Brokeback Mountain",4/10,22 September 2021,"Jane Campion seems to be one of those feminists who spends all her days raging against the irredeemable boorishness and brutality of men and all her nights jilling herself silly to fantasies of being ravished by the very worst examples of them. I believe I've seen just about every film she's ever made, and I really can't say I've taken away anything more from them than that.'In The Cut' and 'Holy Smoke' both had brief moments of interest, but the truth of the matter is she's only made one film of any substance, and that's 'The Piano'. This one seems about one part that and two parts 'Brokeback Mountain', but there doesn't seem to be any reason for it to exist and it has absolutely nothing of any interest to say. It's a dull anti-story with tiresome dialogue and underdeveloped, unconvincing, characters, somewhat ameliorated by competent acting and cinematography.There's two hours of runtime and about 10 minutes of tale. One gets the impression she desperately wanted to make a 'There Will Be Blood' but somehow ended up with a slightly gay 'Heaven's Gate'.",The Power of the Dog
1170,20,nidhunmoviebuff,A critical lens turned on toxic masculinity. Brilliant!,8/10,15 September 2021,"Easily the best performance of Benedict Cumberbatch's career, 'The Power of the Dog' is a riveting western that focuses on the perils of toxic masculinity and strained family relationships.Cumberbatch and the talented Jesse Plemons star as a pair of diametrically opposite brothers who quietly fued in their 1920s ranch house as one brother does not approve of the other's new bride.Cumberbatch plays the alpha male cowboy, dominating his more reserved and empathetic brother.Kirsten Dunst is electric as the new woman who gets in between the brothers and her quiet, effeminate and seemingly naïve son (an electric Kodi Smit-McPhee) takes a shine to Cumberbatch's rough and tumble nature.Cumberbatch elevates this film, playing an able foil for director Jane Campion's grand vision to throw light on how toxic masculinity can corrupt even the most noble souls and fracture families and relationships.This slow burn captivates with the acting chops of its leads and the taut climax will leave you entranced. A must see film sure to rake in the awards this year!Highly recommended!",The Power of the Dog
1171,21,Avwillfan89,"Complex, spellbinding and incredibly well performed.",9/10,16 September 2021,"This is one of those films that grabs you by the throat, or the chin, and refuses to let go until the credits roll.It follows the book that it's based on, by Thomas Savage, very closely. Though it may look like a simple story - an angry rancher who torments his brother's new wife and son when they come to live with him - it's much more complicated and fascinating than that.Phil Burbank is a toxic man's man and loves to show it off: easily offended, filthy, hands on, cruel, homophobic, suspicious and a bachelor. But as the story moves on, a different side to him is shown: one of raw vulnerability, loneliness, deep self-hatred and alienation.He is someone who is brilliant at ranching and loves the lifestyle. But the exact thing he loves prevents him from being who he is: a gay man. Which is a big no-no in this time and place.At first he sees Peter, his new nephew, as a weakling deserving of mockery and taunts. But when he sees that not only is the boy highly intelligent, but also immune to his cow hands's insults, he takes a shine to him and begins to show him the ropes of the ranch's lifestyle.As this is a Jane Campion film, don't expect a happy conclusion or a happy feeling when going into this film. It's rough, gritty, gut-wrenching and has non stop tension throughout. There were a few funny moments, such as Phil's brother George's inability to string two words together at times, or Phil's deliberate lack of social skills, but they come sparingly.George, despite being the kind one, is not without flaws (none of the main characters are). He is completely clueless to his wife's sufferings and how she would feel being at the ranch all day, away from her life in the inn, and being tormented by her brother in law. The Burbank ranch is not exactly a place for a woman. It's certainly not a place for a woman like Rose, who is easily brought to tears and insecure, and even less so (or so it seems) a boy like Peter. So she turns into an alcoholic, giving Phil a reason to turn George and Peter against her.To say this is an intense watch is an understatement. The shots of New Zealand, posing as Montana, and Johnny Greenwood's score is overpowering and completely breathtaking.But it's Benedict Cumberbatch who steals the show, committing full on to the complex and difficult role and capturing all the little nuances of the character with a delicate precision. I always knew he was one of the absolute greats of actors. I'm just incredibly happy so many more people can see it now.",The Power of the Dog

1173,23,hunter-friesen,"Campion's ""Power of the Dog"" reinvents the Western genre",8/10,17 November 2021,"Despite being the master of the gangster genre with such films as ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino,"" and ""The Irishman,"" Martin Scorsese cites ""The Age of Innocence"" as his most violent film. It's a bizarre statement, considering the 1993 period piece features no sex, swearing, or physicality. Instead, the violence that the film harbors is purely emotional and under the surface, carrying far more damaging effects that past than any external wound.Similarly, Jane Campion's ""The Power of the Dog"" is one of the most violent films of the year - and of the Western genre - all without a gun, knife, or fistfight.The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers run one of the most successful ranches in Montana. Phil is handsome, calculating, and utterly brutal. He lives purely for the land, paying no mind to the feelings of those around him. George is pudgy and sensitive, and always on the receiving end of Phil's torments. Together they represent Romulus and Remus, ruling over a vast empire that could topple at any moment.On one of their cattle drives, George becomes smitten by a widow named Rose. The couple swiftly marries and moves back to the mansion-sized ranch house. Disapproving of this union, Phil unleashes his cunning fury on Rose and her emasculated son, Peter. But there's more to Peter than meets the eye, as his outward weakness may not be an honest reflection of what's inside. After some time, Phil begins to warm up to Peter and take him under his wing. Is this latest gesture a softening that leaves Phil exposed, or another one of his mind games that will delve further into menace?As a director, Campion has often been able to communicate the unsayable. Her films often resemble a poem more than a narrative. Based on her past features of ""Sweetie"" and ""The Piano,"" it can be said that she isn't concerned with only opening one door, or telling her audience exactly how to feel. That ambiguity brings out the power of interpretation, leaving the viewer with the film in their mind long after the runtime has passed.""The Power of the Dog"" doesn't stray from that trademark as Campion tightly wounds her surprise psychosexual drama. There's a cutting edge to each frame, epically lensed by Ari Wegner as the vast prairies of New Zealand stand in for Montana plains. A shot of a knotted rope, the castration of a bull, or the movement of a cigarette tells as much of the story as any piece of dialogue. Every act becomes a piece of symbolism, carrying an intentional ritualistic weight. And with plucked strings, Radiohead frontman Jonny Greenwood (a notable collaborator of director Paul Thomas Anderson), squeezes the last drops of tension out of every scene.Still, when the dialogue takes primacy, Campion, adapting the words of Thomas Savage's 1967 novel, makes sure it still stings. Phil uses his words to cut those while they're down, with a sharpness that cannot be matched. It doesn't help that his cowhands, who worship his every move, sneer and snicker along.In the lead role of Phil, Cumberbatch reaches new heights. The British thespian has built his career by playing the smartest man in the room, with roles such as Sherlock Holmes on television, Alan Turing in ""The Imitation Game,"" and Doctor Strange in the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here, that supreme intelligence brings along its coinciding deficiencies of the emotional and empathetic sort. Branding Phil as carrying ""toxic masculinity"" would be too much of an oversimplification as Campion takes that weakness and spins it into something far less one-dimensional.While Phil may hate himself on the inside, George is more outward with his self-loathing, which inevitably gets passed on to Rose, as she deals with despair by turning towards the bottle. The real-life couple of Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst are great in their supporting roles, as they find solace in each other's arms in the brief moments they have together.Acting as the yin to Phil's yang (and also as the surprise actor showcase within the film) is Kodi Smit-McPhee as Peter, whose external simplicity masks his internal strength and awareness. The battle between Phil and Peter is one of wits, with the outcome recontextualizing the film into something more than the sum of its parts.Jane Campion has made a grand return to feature films with ""The Power of the Dog,"" crafting an enigmatic, modern take on the well-worn genre of the Western. It's the film equivalent of fine wine, as it's near perfect at the moment, and will only get better with age.",The Power of the Dog
1174,24,rmirchandani,Stunning imagery,8/10,18 November 2021,"Jane Campion's ""The Power of the Dog"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Kristen Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jesse Plemons and Thomasin McKenzie is a blissfully entertaining and intriguing Western Drama that captures the viewer's attention and leaves them in utter shock and disbelief. The story follows Phil Burbank, a conventional, blunt, and narcissistic cowboy rancher, who is set in his own ways.The film's breathtaking scenery and beautiful score makes the spectator aware of the surroundings and persuades them to think about the time period and the double layered meaning of the title. The title is an allegory and foreshadows Phil Burbank's eventual demise.The revelation that Pete purposefully gave Phil animal skin from a sick cow is none other than surprising. I genuinely thought that Pete forgave Phil for treating him poorly in the beginning. I guess even the nicest souls hold grudges. In a way, Pete's decision is sweet and kind. All he wanted is for his mother to be happy and comfortable on the ranch. Her downward spiral into alcoholism due to Phil's antics left Pete uneasy, hence the constant flickering of his comb. One might decree that the Pete and his mother were in cahoots together. She sold the cow skin to the Indians, while Pete gained Phil's trust and love, and set sick dead cow skin in his midst. In the modern age, Phil's infection can be cured using antibiotics. He knew that he would not make it and decided to wear a black suit to the doctor's appointment.To conclude, The Power of the Dog isn't a typical Western, but it made me appreciate this genre and develop a liking to it.

1177,27,severindringel,A modern western that takes its time,8/10,16 November 2021,"Jane Campion and pianos, they just fit. 12 years after her last feature film, the New Zealander returns to give us The Power of the Dog, a western that triggers Brokeback Mountain vibes in many ways. An adapted story about two brothers who couldn't be more different and who look after their ranch together. When one suddenly marries, all normality is gone from the other brother's life and he is confronted with new people who torpedo his life and turn it completely upside down.We meet the protagonist Phil, played by a fabulous Benedict Cumberbatch, as a homophobic, cruel and charismatic creep who feels no emotion and exposes those who are different in every situation. Due to the setting, the action takes place in the 1920s, his colleagues naturally welcome this behaviour and celebrate the bully. In this way he also keeps the upper hand over his brother George (Jesse Plemons) and is not in danger of losing his status as boss. George, unlike Phil, is clearly more empathetic, sympathising with his brother's victims but unable to challenge him because of his introversion. Despite being so different, the two share a distorted form of brotherly love that can hardly be explained by objective judgement. George confides in the village's widowed waitress Rose (Kirsten Dunst) and the two develop a love affair. This results in them marrying and Phil now having to deal with a new threat. The often non-direct confrontations between Phil and Rose are absolute highlights of the film. They not only serve as showpieces for the fantastic performances by Cumberbatch and Dunst, but suggest a menacing feeling that just makes your sweat run down. This is especially the case in a scene where Rose tries her hand at the piano (hence the reference at the beginning to Campion's masterpiece The Piano), but is constantly interrupted and visibly unsettled by Phil. Rose takes a whole new direction in her development from then on, which often became too frustrating and repetitive for me. Especially when Rose's son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) returns, he virtually replaces his mother as Phil's threat. Indeed, he discovers something about him that pushes Phil to take him under his wing and divert attention from his mother. The final act is almost entirely a study of Phil and Peter's relationship and their various interpretations of masculinity.Campion makes an aesthetically brilliant comeback with The Power of the Dog. The shots of the Montana mountain landscape (even though the film was shot in New Zealand) sink into you and are harmoniously accompanied by an atmospheric Jonny Greenwood score. What starts out as a rivalry ends up being a character study about a bitter man who carries around secrets and tries to blind them with malice. It is very exciting to watch how the changes in his brother's life affect Phil and where he stands at the end compared to the beginning. In the end, I found it hard to categorise the power of The Power of the Dog. But maybe it doesn't need to. Perhaps acting excellence, brilliant direction and sheer beauty are quite enough. It is certainly a film that will divide opinions.",The Power of the Dog

1180,30,Bad-Good-Great,Just let the dog lie down in the dust,2/10,11 October 2021,"Very disappointed at this movie. When it started, it looked so grand with hopeful prospect, the panorama scene of the west, the drive of the cattle...everything just looked great with fantastic cinematography. Then it started to slowly crash and burn. Lot of the scenes came up unnecessarily clueless like the dialog came with them. The scene then from bad to worse. Drank at the bar, dined in the hotel's restaurant, the dialog just felt more and more meaningless and lame, the laughter from the neighboring table felt forced and phony, same as those from the cowboys. Scenes dragged along with deadbeat paces, trying so hard to prolong the duration of the movie. Nothing felt natural but fake scene after scene. Where's the dog? And where's the power from the dog? Was it so difficult to make a movie a bit more logic and reasonable?Everything in this movie just gave you a forced, awkward, do-nothing drag-on. What is the purpose of this movie? To show us how a ranch boss suddenly found out he's in the closet too long and decided to become the sequel character of The Broken Back Mountain? Did we need such long period to reveal the story of personal evolving progress?At first, I thought those viewers who gave low ratings were biased and homophobic, but after I've tortured myself to watch it and fast lost my patience, I had to agree with these viewers' afterthoughts. This is a terrible movie disguised in western genre but looked fake through and through.",The Power of the Dog

But then others take away a lot. I really don't want to break it all down here; suffice it to say, this movie is a mixed bag.However, the last few scenes had this build up that left me feeling teased and cheated, and almost rather rushed. It was bad enough that there were two plots running along, and neither really took off. But to just be done and get one little Bible quote to explain the title and actions of the character...yeah, that went right past my head and left me actually upset.I'd say it's not the worst thing I've seen, but I think that's mostly because I enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch stealing the damn show.",The Power of the Dog

1185,35,tallard,What has become of the great Campion? Homophobia and animal abuse,4/10,30 September 2021,"This film is based on a novel. That that novel was written by a male in 1967 in the style of Harlequin Romances and Louis Lamours is one thing. That a supposedly ""feminist"" filmmaker would adapt that novel to this absolutely terrible movie is beyond understanding.Though I haven't read the book, the many book reviews I've read since make me think the film script is not very faithful to the book. It's 2021, and to use ""Look-How-Homophobic-These-Yesteryear-Cowboys-Were"" rings empty and virtue-signally. If Campion was actually interested in telling a story of homophobic-closet-homoerotica, she could have more relevantly chosen a contemporary story of closet homosexuals in modern cowboy country. It just seems facile to manipulate a novel that may have had some relevance in 1967, the whole writing style of the story is very passé.I'd not heard of the movie, but chose to watch it based on Campion's history and Cumberbatch's great acting talents. But I am sorely disappointed. Cumberbatch couldn't breathe any life into this stale script and the other two lead actors are their usual unconvincing selves.There are also failings at the production level. The total condoning of bullying behaviour, and of animal abuse, does not serve the narrative in the least. The filming of Montana in New Zealand is an utter failure. The costume choices, specially for Cumberbatch, were farcical. And sadly, as great an actor as Cumberbatch is, he really can not pull off the turn of last century American West accent and demeanour.Finally, as in some great insipid lack of vision, the film ends with an illogical untimely death, tweaked with hints of wrong-doing, a misdirect seemingly created to add a little spice at the end. One must also wonder at the misleading marketing/synopsis/plot. This is not a film about two opposite personality brothers, it's about one broken man, and the negative he shoves onto all the world (people and animals) around him.Is this what the future of feminist film making looks like?Some will note that many reviewers here are confused about the switch from nasty to mentorship in the last third of the film. I think it's because many missed the closet-homosexuality that drives this. Phil was in love with the Bronc, the Bronc died, leaving Phil hurt and angry, comes a nubile second closet-homosexual, of course this was to be the outcome. This is mostly laid out by Phil in the latter portion of the film. Closet homophobia is the true driver of this film, but a lot of viewers missed it.",The Power of the Dog
1186,36,Aria_Athena,A bit too much of a slow burn for my taste,6/10,16 September 2021,"It's a heavy drama which takes place in the old west. It mostly focuses on a rancher, Phil (Cumberbatch), whose toxic personality drags down everyone around him.For me, in the end the film payed off. I really liked where it went and how it ended, but I was quite bored during the second act. The movie had a slow start, which I thought it handled well, and then the pace got even slower. While I can't point out anything specific that was superfluous, 2 hour seemed too long. I remember the beginning, I remember the ending and some key plot moments, but I barely remember anything that happened in between.

1188,38,adamk-2,A Hard Slog on the Old Ranch,4/10,14 October 2021,"""The Power of the Dog"", written and directed by Jane Campion, is a prarie-set family drama. Two brothers run the family ranch in 1925 Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a diamond in the rough, sort of, in that while he's dirty and smells of cattle, he's educated and sneers cruel jibes at everyone. Sherlock in a stetson, if you will. His doofus brother, (Jesse Plemmons) takes up with a local waitress (Kirsten Dunst) and marries her, which pleases the possessive Phil not at all.It's all rather dreary and dull and overlong. Each scene and pause therein takes just a few seconds longer than it really should, sabotaging the prospect of any tension rising at all. Cumberbatch is mediocre, Plemmons is surprisingly dull, while Dunst resorts to amdram acting when her character takes to the bottle, staggering everywhere. There's a surprise cameo from Keith Carradine, which is nice, and some great scenery, but my god, Terrance Malick could have done something wonderful with THAT. Kodi Smit-McPhee is wonderfully unsettling at Dunst's son, and there is a nice twist at the end in his story arc, but that's about it. Oh, and there's also Jonny Greenwood's music, all droning, queasy strings that really, really gets annoying. A palpable miss, this one.",The Power of the Dog

One day George Burbank brings to the ranch his new wife Rose Gordon with her son Peter Gordon. After some time Peter Gordon explores his true sexual life.The Power of the Dog is not a classical movie when you are one hundred percent sure, how you can write about this movie is because it is about almost everything. The Power of the Dog is a very impressive and interesting movie about love, hate, past and the sexual life, so it is very difficult to say what the movie is and how to describe more specifically what happened at the beginning.Director of this movie is Jane Campion who is an oscar winner for best writing for the movie The Piano and one oscar nominee for best director for The Piano too. This movie is so impressive that I haven't found any problems with the director. On the contrary, I am so excited about the style of directing this movie, because it is so impressive that I have no words. She built a very good atmosphere which you will find later not at the beginning, because the atmosphere is built slowly here. Jane Campion did a very good job here, I think the best job in movies that are released in 2021 yet.Screenplay was written by Jane Campion and here she did a very impressive job too. Sequences of the movie are written very well and I didn't find any problems here either. Screenplay slowly introduces to us the past of every main character, slowly it builds tension and the whole plot for this movie is done in a very clever and unpredictable way. Except that the screenplay will uncover the past, it shows directly or indirectly the dark side of every main character. This whole movie is unpredictable and you cannot say what will happen in the next five or ten minutes, because you can't guess it.Casting director did a very good job here, because every actor fits the role. Kodi Smit-McPhee fits his role perfectly, because he looks like an urban man and a freak. The combination with his visage, the characteristics of a character and behaviour it is a perfect choice. Benedict Cumberbatch was chosen very well too as well as Kirsten Dunst or Jesse Plemons. Every actor did a very good job here with their performances, it looked and felt natural.Camera was perfect and I have nothing to say against the director of photography. I like the style which was chosen for this movie. It looks good for the movie and the shots render well the reality of the 1925 ages.Music here was very dominant and it fits well to this style of movie. I think the music was done very well because the melody and the songs were very good and memorable, for the style of the movie the style of songs fits very well.Well, The Power of the Dog was after many months, the first very good movie published by Netflix. I have nothing to say against the movie because as I said many times, the movie is so impressive and done in a very professional way that there were not any mistakes from the director and writer.98%",The Power of the Dog
1193,43,michaelseither,Wokestern western is quite politically correct. Be gay and enjoy it.,3/10,22 September 2021,"John Wayne is probably the totem for the romanticized American west produced by Hollywood in the first half of the 20th century. He is certainly not the only ""toxic male"" who tries to dominate everybody and everything he contacts (think Maureen O'Hara in her bloomers being dragged around by him). He kills misunderstood bad guys who lacked love as children and takes land away from Native Americans so ""white"" people could make America pan Europe all over again. I won't go into how heterosexual he was because there were a handful of Hollywood male stars who both portrayed he-men and were closeted and repressed gay-men. But we have all these tropes that need attacking. We need to address these traditional ills from the last century, don't we? Isn't that why we go to the movies? To be taught lessons or watch really smart people show us the way through pretty pictures? Entertainment? Why? Romance, drama, comedy, thrills, chills, well no, you rube. You want circuses with your bread? Nah. You need to be shown the ""way.""Cumberbatch's hat is a hoot. Seeing it and his petulant attitude just calls to question, ""you can't be serious, right?"" But it is. He is. Very serious. Howlingly funny serious. The whole movie is very serious. Self-flagellation serious. A steaming pile of serious. So much symbolism. So many pretty paper flowers burned in petulant frustration. Maybe you're up for a lesson or two? Be prepared.Quite few people liked this. You might too. Who knows?

I gave it three stars because I lasted about a third of the way through it before deciding to do something a little more fun. After all, it is my time.

1196,46,rich-mac,Exceptional,9/10,1 November 2021,"Make no mistake, this is a masterpiece. I will acknowledge from the outset that it's clear some people won't like this movie - but if you like movies where atmosphere is created by the slow caress of the camera lingering on its subject, movies slowed to country time, where characters breathe and the soundtrack wafts between subject and landscape moving like the wind, movies where people are real, then you must watch this.There is an intensity and purpose to this movie that is virtually unparalleled. In one scene the camera shifts its gaze from studying two of the main characters to lingering close up on some horses in the yard. Filling the screen with chestnut flanks caught in the sun, slowly moving about the horses - the backing music building intensity all the while - the effect is mesmerising, the drama almost physically palpable.The experience of the film is like witnessing the slow opening of a flower, petals slowly unfolding. I'm leaving out any detailed description of the film's subjects, or the landscape (which holds it's own secrets), or indeed the story - these are between Campion and the viewer - suffice it to say that this movie is an exceptional bit of film making from all concerned, well worthy of your attention and concentration. 9.5/10.",The Power of the Dog

Technical talent, no soul. They know how, but they don't know what.This film reaps success among reviewers - although it seems to me rather out of some didactic predictability, because it appeals to a postmodern thematic ""vocabulary"" of a certain type of engaged liberal audience (alas mechanically, without humor, perspective or balance). ""Toxic masculinity"", check, female perspective, check, something queer, check."" The lay spectators seem to be divided into two extreme camps: The fans praise the atmosphere building, the camera painting, the meditative pace, but also the portrayal of the toxic masculinity of Phil. Opponents appear to be typical by-products of the toxic masculinity: ""manly"" men, logical, technical, practical, just not emotional - for whom western genre is to be about tough guys who don't talk much, shootings not emotions, plot not contemplation, so this film seems unreasonably slow to them.I don't have issues with twisting the genre, playing out melodrama in the ecosystem of western, questing the classic/outdated cliches of manliness. I don't have issue with slow-paced movies where one is expected to soak the atmosphere of a place and time. (For example I love Terrence Mallick's early visual delicacies ... however this might be not only positive comparison with this film :) ). By the way, dear machos, what do you think those stone-faced western heroes did when they were staring into that far void, all the time, wordless, (e)motionless? Perhaps, could they have been soaking the greater beauty of the land? :D Visually, TPOTD is really an art-piece Montana of the 1920s was evoked first-class, even if on New Zealand sets.Western is a genre traditionally narrated by men for men. Reaffirming cliches - one type of imagining masculinity, in sense of ""when men were still real men"". Because women could not be strong and self-dependent and men could not be beautiful or objects of desire or emotional or vulnerable or whatnot. Men's appearance was practical, purposeful, technical ... or just given by the conditions of perpetual adventure - they were robots to fight, win and die, who created and perpetuated the culture of hardiness. ""Seeing"" western through the eyes of a female director seems like a juicy invitation ...And then the ""gay thing"". It is easy to expect that TPOTD will be compared to a similarly slow (and gay-related) Brokeback Mountain ... but And Lee presented at least a cleverly constructed dramatic arch of an impossible romance. Here I missed any emotional spark between anyone and anyone. Of course, Jane Campion is a talented award-winning director (for example, the famous Piano, which told much stronger and more consistent story in a much smaller set-up). Well, it is simply not possible to compare the fragile but at the same time internally determined and willful main heroine of Piano with how Rose is depicted in TPOTD.In The Power of the Dog (despite a quote from the Bible I don't see how the title is related to the content) we start with cowboys embedded in a harsh male frontier environment. The distillate of this peculiar world - Phil (arrogant, tactless, immature, vicious, an icon of an almost infantile cult among his peers) - is contrasted first with the polished gentle-man brother George, then Rose - the fragile owner of the inn and her even more fragile (stiff, artificial, camp,...) teenage son Peter. Burning some paper roses ... cool, let's dislike each-other a bit and gradually get closer - as expected from similar stories, right?No. And here comes the script: Half of the film (!) it portrays the landscape and lets Phil's sadism and machismo bloom. Torment the paper and human flowers ""a bit"". Then, for incomprehensible reasons, an evolution not even barely sketched, Phil decides to mentor Pete. Huh? Even if I might have secretely wished for it, even if ""this type of film"" calls for it, I could not get how/why. Where is the development, growing towards it? Zero. Maybe Phil does it just to tease Rose, ... but he apparently doesn't feel like fighting her that much, she's not a partner in battle at all, she's a poor untalented wreck that sinks into booze and almost some sort of pathetic incestuous attachment to Peter, wrigs her face dramatically, runs like a crazy hapless caricature (glove scenes). Her trauma somewhat doesn't seem to reflect Phil fully, it is hard to believe that she's sunk like this just because of him. Then Mr. Peter - he doesn't evolve his personality in any way, he's still awkward, artificial, polished. Even if I like to see intermediate personalities (and genders) and I don't applaud straight-acting among us gays, Peter is portrayed as a rather annoyingly stiff alien as if transposed from old or odd art drama into the Wild West. Out of place. At the same time, Phil - pain in the ass as he is, seems also natural in some aspect, a guy who likes to talk straightforward without fuss (e.g. A scene where George suggest for him to wash), also a slightly something of a ""misunderstood artist"", who has at least some musical talent and seems to have passed through college studies of classical languages (!). He chose ""to stink"". Why did he become a cowboy? Did he escape from a moralist conventions of the city into a freer wilderness, where he found male lover, bonding unseen at the fringe? It is these paradoxes in the background that would be worth of more insight. There the untapped potential. What went wrong - the script, the corporate producers, Netflix' average audience, or too much budget to make ""too gay movie""?The final plot twist of the film may take time to digest (what happened). Not because the clues would not be suggestive enough, but because it just does not fit into drama we have just watched. Again, it is as if from a different movie, does not smoothly align with the previous development of the story and characters, it catches one unprepared. Why? What for? To achieve what effect with the spectator? Why the rapprochement from the middle act - if it turns out that we are at the end again in the initial premise ""we against him""?The macho (with a background story!) develops into a complex and slightly understandable character, the fragile woman into a half-lunatic wreck that just wanders helplessly in her decorative-object fragility, a young stiff queen into a schemer more cold-blooded than his antagonist. Why? What for? Was it a mirror - ""the survival of the most callous"" - or a bitter irony? Unfortunately, for some reason I can't believe this sophistication was present here. It's definitely not as smart as many intellectuals will claim. It's leaky, unfounded in the story or characterization.Gay characters here are extreme, almost on the level of a cartoon book, and therefore somehow lifeless: a toxic alpha-male who humiliates everything ""sissy"" around him (it is hard to associate here his true sexual orientation) and then an artificial walking hanger who seems to feel nothing, just survives and dissects and ""big eyes goggling"". But in the context of the story, the gay themes seem almost useless to me. The ""discovery"" in the middle of the second half has somewhat lukewarm effect on both characters. As if there were just ""some winks to queer audience placed"".This film left me neither feeling good (content, understanding, resonating,...) nor with any intense aftertaste on my tongue. An unnecessarily long journey to nowhere (while I am capable of enjoying those otherwise), with unnatural plot twists, incomprehensible jumps in the behavior of the characters without the necessary development. Although the toxic masculinity, with its rugged unemotional John Wayne-ish cliches, needs to be denuded and dissected - here absurdly it seems to me that the most flesh-and-blood character to empathize with was the one embodying it.",The Power of the Dog
1198,48,Alien901,Not worth it Sweety,1/10,12 September 2021,"The core problem lies in the film's largely lackluster story. Surely, this narrative could have been retooled to be more engaging. The Power of the Dog starts slow and never really picks up, in spite of its all-around promising cast and crew. Additionally, due to this, the film starts to come across as dull. It flutters back and forth over the line of boredom as it occasionally reignites the spectator's attention. That being said, it's likely that Campion's new film will be quite divisive given that it does have its few unique qualities that shine.Conclusion his type proved again that they only put up act for those marvelous big pay movies.

1203,53,Wellenstock,The Dog isn't very Powerful,3/10,17 September 2021,"To all of the reviewers saying ""mysterious and complex"" and giving it a high rating... Translation It's a senseless story that leads to no resolve and alienates the viewer. It's not that the viewer isn't smart enough to follow the story, it's that the writer/director has failed to communicate the story. If the written story makes sense then the director failed but if what we see is the actual way the story was written then the writer failed. No matter what happened this is not a good film.To all of the reviewers saying, ""Great acting!"" and giving it a high rating... It's not really great acting. Did the actors fill you with joy one moment then move you to tears the next? Did the actors stun you with wisdom did you completely relate to and understand their character? Phil, Rose and Peter all had senseless character changes by the end of the film, there was no explanation as to why and it wasn't revealed at all in the acting.Considering the hundreds of brilliant filmmakers and brilliant writers out there that will never get a chance to make it to the big screen, that this 'thing' was made instead, is a tragedy.",The Power of the Dog

1209,59,modianush-77899,"Slow, Queerbait, Animal Abuse, and Overall Pointless.",2/10,1 October 2021,"So, this film was SLOW. I don't have any problem with slow-paced movies, but this one was really slow because the thing with slow pacing is that a Director needs to build a world in the film, in which the audience doesn't feel bored, instead the audience like being in that world even if the story is going slow. And that world-building is not done properly in this film.Honestly, it was very close to become unbearable.Also, there is so much queerbaiting done here. And there was the depiction of Homophobia in this film, considering the year 1925 setting, but the worst thing is that nothing was done at the end to correct it.And there is a LOT of animal abuse, and I get it that this film is set in year 1925 and people back then did not care much about animals, but depicting that and showing it to people in 2021 is not good, animal abuse is animal abuse no matter what year the story is set in.But, the slow pace, queerbaiting and the animal abuse is not the only problems in the film, THE ENDING is disappointing as well because that ending was RUSHED and POINTLESS.(Giving NO SPOILERS) It felt like nothing really happened in the major sections of the movie, and when something was actually happening, we were suddenly at the end.And this film is not that well-made either, which should be an Awards Contender, not even for the Crafts Categories, at least not according to me.And overall, this entire film feels pointless to me, because neither it has some great commentary for an issue, nor it has a good story.So, when you sit through a slow and boring movie, which is not well-made, and has a pointless story with a lot of animal abuse and queerbaiting, you clearly don't like the movie. And unfortunately THE POWER OF THE DOG is an example of that.",The Power of the Dog

1214,64,cornelia123,Spoilers for those who don't understand the 'ending',8/10,15 November 2021,"The Power of the Dog is the type of film that action/comic book filmgoers will hate, which is why I actually liked it. It's in my opinion more of a psychological slowburner.The film is set in a lonesome ranch in the middle of nowhere, run by two middle-aged brothers Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Burbank (Jesse Plenoms). From the beginning of the film you see how different in character the two brothers are: Phil is a harsh 'macho-type' horse-riding cowboy, who does the hands on ranch work and is mainly in charge of the other cowhands. He seems to be 'needy' of his brother's attention and constantly keeps watch in case he loses his grip on him. George, on the other hand, is the quiet brother, the one in charge of the finances, the one who you hardly see on a horse. He also seems fed up of the whole 'macho cowboy' life he is surrounded by and the strings that attach him to his controlling brother. Fortunately for George, while they are moving cattle to their ranch, they stop over in an Inn run by Rose (Kirsten Dunst), with the help of her creative-type son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Much to Phil's horror, George marries Rose and brings her to their ranch and the rest of the film sees Phil antagonise Rose, who takes to drinking to dull the pain of feeling 'not good enough'. When Peter goes to the ranch to spend his holiday from Medical School, Phil and the cowhands take no time in calling out to him 'Nancy Boy', and the viewer is left wondering what is going to happen when suddenly Phil acts all 'nice' towards Peter, wanting to show him the cowboy ropes, while still sneering at the boy's mother, as if in 'war' with her.It turns out that Phil is a learned man, studied the Greek and Latin, but also a closet gay who was deeply inlove with the cowboy who showed him the ropes, whom he idolised. Peter finds out Phil's 'secret' hiding hole, where he hides a stash of nude-men's magazines so is aware of Phil's 'secret'. He is also aware of his mother getting worse, with her alcoholism leaving her bed-ridden most of the time.Now here's to where some viewers don't understand the ending. When Indians ask if they can have the cow hides laid out in the sun, which Phil would have burnt anyway, Rose in a desperate bid to do one over Phil says yes and they give her leather embroidered gloves in return. She is then put to bed in a nervous breakdown, and refuses to take the beautiful gloves off.Phil had been making a rope out of strips of hide for Peter, which he had to finish before the boy went back to Medical School so they both could go up the mountain to visit a cliffside (his ultimate revenge on Rose by 'accidently killing her son).When Phil finds out about what Rose has sold the hides he is furious but Peter tells him that he has a raw hide he can use, that he got it because he wanted to be like him. So Phil cuts it into strips and then places them in water which becomes bloody and continues braiding the rope for Peter. Suddenly it then cuts to a scene finds Phil on top of a mortuary slab, and George is told that they will find out in a couple of days what killed Phil. Then you have a final scene of Peter looking out of his window and seeing George and Rose outside kissing beside a beautiful fountain they must have had built, something which Phil would never have allowed. Then Peter smiles.It is quiet obvious to me that Peter deliberately gave that raw hide to Phil, knowing he had a bad cut in his hand, in order for it to get infected. In an earlier scene you saw him go horse-riding up the mountain and finding a black dead bull then take his medical knife out and start cutting away the skin. As a medical student he would have known that bull had anthrax, and it is this raw hide that he gives to Phil.Earlier, in a conversation with Phil, Peter had told him how his father (who he found hanged one day) use to worry about him because he thought he was too cold and Peter explains that he has tried to be kind hearted ever since, but Phil laughed at that because he thought Pete was a 'sissy', a 'nancy', not a 'cold' man at all, that his father was wrong.As it turned out, Pete's father was right. Pete knew it was life or death between Phil, his mother and himself, and he coldbloodedly did what he had to do to 'get rid of the problem'. Now flowers will grow in the ranch, beauty and art (the 'feminine') will live in harmony with hard ranch cowboy work (the 'masculine') and nobody will be forced to be somebody they are not. Sadly, Phil had been 'forced' to sleep with a woman when he was a teenager by his own mother who sent the two brothers to the 'whores' to make them 'men', and as such, by the end of the film you see that that 'circle' has been broken.",The Power of the Dog
1215,65,chawk-76623,Really pay attention closely.,9/10,19 September 2021,"This is a movie that you really have to pay attention to and really watch. In the end if you piece everything together like a detective you will understand what was happening in the whole movie. It is a movie that you can watch what times in order to grasp everything better once you have pieced everything together. Every member of the cast did their job spectacularly and the cinematography is stunning! I like the time period (1925) and the environment.

1216,66,bhulery,Lots of things happening but never plays out In the end,6/10,14 September 2021,"Lots of things happening but never plays out. You think something is right around the corner but it's never plays out like you want it too. Relationships start and you need more details for it to all makes sense but it never gets there. This is one of those movies it wants you to imagine wants happens in the end and why... that's why I'm watching the movie, give me more details. In the end I can't recommend this film. I need a beginning, climax and a end but it comes up short. You're left wondering what happened in the end and/why. You have clues but no facts to come to a conclusion. Why do directors do this it's lazy and annoying. Maybe the important scene got cut I don't know why.

1217,67,rockridgehouse,This movie is a lot like barbequed ribs.,7/10,13 September 2021,"The flavor is good, but there's not a lot of meat on the bone.If you want dialogue, this isn't for you - which lead, for me, to a lack of empathy for any of the four main characters. Everyone does a lot of quiet emoting but there's a lot less time spend on their interaction than on the gorgeous long shots. I believe the kitchen help, who are rarely in the movie, have more lines than the main characters.This is a quiet movie with grand, beautiful, lingering shots of the isolated landscape. There are also plenty of lingering close-ups of Cumberbatchs' sweaty, dirty, somewhat psychopathic face.By the end of the movie my reaction was - ""so what.""

1220,70,BrandedToKill,The devil is in the details...,7/10,8 October 2021,"I just randomly watched this movie, not knowing anything about it all, just that I like Benedict as an actor. It was slow and sort of unsettling and I had to ponder the movie for a while after it finished. Let me just say this, the devil is in the details with this one. Pay very close attention when watching it, I think it pays off pretty well. I had several 'oh crap' moments after the movie, when I started connecting the dots. To call this a Western is a bit misleading, the setting is in the west (Montana) but that really has nothing to do with the movie at all, nor should it define its genre. I can see how folks might not like this one due to the pacing and some of the subject matter but the acting really is quite good and the movie is well made. Also, let's just say the ending might pass right over some people's head if they hadn't been paying attention or had already made up their mind what the movie was about. I'd really love to say more but spoilers and all. I think this one will start out slow with audiences but will age well over time.

This is one of them. Another movie in which I didn't find one single interesting person or a person that could inspire sympathy. Yes, I see of course that Phil impersonates toxic masculinity, but if other than that, the movie, which lasts more than 2 hours has nothing to offer (besides some nice views, nice photography), I don't see the point in going to see it. After all, we already have too many real life examples of toxic masculinity, don't we?

1224,74,yhoha_2001,"Slow and chaotic, but it makes sense.",7/10,15 September 2021,"The opening events set the tone of the movie perfectly. Two brothers with disparate personalities live in a ranch, then meeting an insecure, mourning mother and her adored son. With the wonderful job by the cast, the events rarely fail to be gripping.Throughout the chapters, the actions of the characters somehow might seem random, but with the subtle intricacies embedded by the beautiful cinematography, it can be sensible.One of those intricacies is in Benedict Cumberbatch's eye game, which was really the pinnacle of the movie, and his performance. He perfectly delivers the difference before and after the exposure of Phil's repressed vehemence, and his obsessive inspiration.Unfortunately, the movie might seem to be drowned in its eeriness and profound details to the point where it could be perceived as a series of too-real events, which wouldn't be an enjoyable watch for some.Practically, the cast was accurate enough for the story. Jesse Plemons continues to show that he's deserving of the latest roles he's getting from some notable filmmakers, without forgetting the chemistry he's shown with his couple, Kirsten Dunst, who was also great.Other than that, the music obviously fit the theme, although some of its uses weren't suitable to some scenes.The Academy Awards won't shy away from this film, that's for sure.

His brother George ends up appearing in the background, being the vivid representation of conformity and the fear of loneliness. Kirsten Dunst steps in, giving it all away, playing George's wife, who struggles internally with past issues. In addition, she has a son, Peter, who stands out for being irreverent for his way of being.Despite a pushed and slow narrative on some occasions, the cinematography and editing of the scenes manage to help tell the story in a miraculous way. Phil sees in Peter the man he wanted to be. A man free from stereotypes, owner of his own personality, abstracted from other people's opinions, and in a jealous way, welcomes him to convey his values of masculinity and the way he understands that a man should behave.It's a story of self-acceptance.

1233,83,joewebsper,In Defence of the Ending,8/10,15 September 2021,"Reading a lot of these reviews I see people have said it ended abruptly or only gave clues as to the finale. SPOILERS ahead.Phil is the epitome of toxic masculinity; a rough, domineering man who derides his gentle brother George and his new wife (Rose) and son (Peter). Following two acts of suffocating tension, Peter points out the barking dog in the mountains, a sight which to date only Phil is able to see (the visionary he is). The initial reaction of shock and surprise gives away to awe and maybe even, love. It is here that his guard is lowered and Peter strikes.Peter acknowledges his mother's descent into alcoholism and depression is the result of Phil's bullyboy ways and decides to do something about it. Think back to the film's opening gambit of voiceover narrative from Peter, ""When my father passed, I wanted nothing more than my mother's happiness, for what kind of man would I be if I did not help my mother? If I did not save her?"" Therein lies all the information we need to decipher the ending.It is noted that Phil never wears gloves which Peter, quiet, astute, observant picks up on. Using his medical knowledge along with his newfound closeness (arguably manipulating Phil's secret homosexuality), he plots a way to kill him off.After Rose gives away Phil's collection of hides, Peter offers Phil his own supply of hides. Herein lies the secret... the leather, clearly ridden with the anthrax of a diseased cattle, and carefully stored by Peter, infects Phil through his open hand wound as he washes and plaits the rope. Within 24h the man is dead. The final scene shows Peter, hands protected in gloves, cautiously holding his rope and placing it under the bed.The alpha dog on the ranch has been destroyed by a more cerebral and predatory animal.",The Power of the Dog

1241,91,hcerri,Absolutely mind-blowing,9/10,3 October 2021,"The film brings suspense and anguish from all sides and directions, you feel the discomfort but you don't know why. In several scenes I found myself shaking, waiting for something bad to happen as I heard the soundtrack play, but nothing really happened and the next scene started.At first, the characters seem weak, without a trajectory, just on scene to fulfill a role. However, as the film progresses, it's the small details that show more about the nature of each character and their backgrounds.Phil, for example, appeared to be too mysterious, too untouchable, without any strong features or a relevant background. Peter looked weak, as if a touch would undo him; he looked like a child in an adult's body. By the end of the film, the two characters surprised me by being the complete opposite of what they appeared to be at the beginning.I confess that I felt angry at the last minutes of the film; nothing seemed to make sense. Why did Phil die like that? How did he die? Infection? But how did he contracted an infection? These thoughts caused me to analyse it further and conclude that yes, I didn't pay enough attention.Upon realizing that Phil wasn't that strong and Peter wasn't that weak, all the scenes that before seemed to make no sense at all made the engines start to move in my mind, especially the phrase Peter said at the beginning, which didn't seem to match his fragile personality.My mind is clouded with so much information that it has suddenly filled me in on the end credits. This film is truly a masterpiece.",The Power of the Dog
1242,92,longamanda-51639,Powerful.,8/10,8 October 2021,"It seems like people want a quick action movie with everything on the table within the first fifteen minutes. This movie is a drama that burns slow but bright. I love a good movie that twists your guts and makes you think about what you are watching. This movie is not a western in the sense of Clint Eastwood Unforgiven but a drama that is trying to say something about men who can be toxic with their masculine attitude. I loved this movie for all the reasons I see others downing it.

1244,94,collinsa-26059,A Movie Salad with too many ingredients,3/10,4 October 2021,"Somebody said this was ""entertaining"". My jaw just dropped. This movie is ANYTHING but entertaining. It's freaking painful! Ok the photography is awesome, the actors are good. But where ia the story? So many disparate metaphors dropped and so many possible storylines begun and cut off that is was dizzying. Was the movie meant to make me feel this confused?. Maybe so. That way I can look stupid - and the vast greatness of the art cannot be touched by my silly judgment. But please, MAKE Benedict Cumberbatch take off the damned chaps!

1245,0,MartinHafer,I have a hard time understanding the love for this film.,3/10,12 December 2020,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a film that is clearly beloved of many folks and they enjoy watching it each and every holiday season. I honestly am happy they enjoy it, though I myself cannot see the charm in watching it. I first saw the movie shortly after it debuted and watched it again tonight and felt disappointed.The story is about the Griswold family NOT traveling but welcoming their parents to spend the holidays with them. Then, unexpectedly Clark' scummy Cousin Eddie and his brood show up. In the midst of this, which Clark hates tremendously, he keeps his hopes up for a Christmas bonus from a nasty boss.As I watched, again and again, I just kept thinking that this isn't funny. Or, if something was funny, it could have been done funnier. In addition, I think making Clark a rather unlikable guy hurt my viewing experience, as he seemed more interested in adultery than his loving and VERY patient wife.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1246,1,TheLittleSongbird,"Silly and predictable, but funny",8/10,25 September 2010,"It mayn't be one of my favourite Christmas movies, but it is one of the funnier ones for me. I agree some of it is silly, and when I say silly I mean silly, and the story is really quite predictable. But it at least looks good with some nice cinematography and scenery, and the music is fine too. The script has many funny moments and the sight gags while silly are respectable. The direction is competent and the performances from Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo are likable while Randy Quaid gives some great relief as a decidedly obnoxious relative. So in conclusion, no masterpiece but it is entertaining, that's what matters to me. 8/10 Bethany Cox

1247,2,Leofwine_draca,Amiable enough,6/10,21 December 2015,"A fun, Christmas-themed comedy movie featuring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. I liked this more than NATIONAL LAMPOON'S European VACATION, although I still haven't seen the original VACATION as yet. This film plays out as you'd expect, featuring Chase juggling the demands of his visiting family members with putting on the whole Christmas razzle-dazzle.The first half of this film is particularly strong when it focuses on decent slapstick moments: the whole situation with the Christmas lights, the stuff in the attic, and the bit with the staple gun, which is my favourite moment. By the time all of the old-timers show up, it does start to get bogged down a bit, although the film is enlivened by the presence of Randy Quaid's enjoyably scuzzy cousin and there are some hilarious scenes like the turkey carving.Occasionally, and especially towards the end, Christmas VACATION descends into schmaltz, but then that's down to John Hughes who can never resist inserting some sentimentality into his work (it's even there in my favourite of his films, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES, although John Candy is so sympathetic that it works). Chase and D'Angelo are on top form here and the film as a a whole is difficult to dislike as it has so much energy and so many constant gags. Watch out for a fresh-faced Juliette Lewis in one of her earlier performances.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1248,3,SnoopyStyle,Griswolds in their Staycation,6/10,22 December 2014,"Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) drag his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), daughter Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to get a Christmas tree. It's the start of a season of ridiculous family celebration. Clark doesn't get along with his yuppie neighbors, the Chesters (Nicholas Guest, Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Clark's parents (John Randolph, Diane Ladd) and Ellen's parents (E. G. Marshall, Doris Roberts) join them. Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her idiot husband Eddie Johnson (Randy Quaid) and their family pay a surprise visit. Clark desperately needs the year-end bonus from his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) to cover a cheque for the pool but he only gets a Jelly of the Month Club.There are a lot of random Christmas jokes. Some of them actually do hit well. However Chevy's shtick was getting tired at this point. Beverly D'Angelo is fine as always. The grandparents are more annoying than funny. The movie misses a great opportunity to give them some personality and depth. Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart. I don't know who are who's parents. The sets of parents could fight against each other over the kids or how Clark is doing or who the family loves more. There is a world of possibilities but they are simply lumps of coal. Even the Griswold kids are not doing the sibling rivalry that well. They're the least convincing kids of the franchise. The fact that the kids are always different could be a source of self-referencing jokes. It seems like Chevy is doing all the heavy lifting to get the laughs. Everybody is playing the straight man until Randy Quaid arrives. Cousin Eddie livens up the movie a little. At least, he adds something to the movie. Also I don't really know who Nicolette Scorsese is, but she's no Christie Brinkley. The movie has a few jokes. I love the cat getting toasted.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1249,4,Prismark10,Festive fun Griswold style,6/10,31 December 2013,"Its a fun filled Christmas, Clark Griswold style with Chevy Chase more likable and less laconic who wants to have a traditional family Christmas with his family.He goes out to the mountain to get a big Christmas tree, he puts down a deposit for swimming pool hoping his Christmas bonus will come through and wants to have the perfect Christmas, what can go wrong?Almost everything as more family members turn up including his cousin played by Randy Quaid and his troublesome dog. His neighbours are annoyed and if that bonus does not come through Clark is up a creek without a paddle.Its huge zany fun especially as some of the cantankerous elderly members of the family provide a lot of humour, plenty of slapstick and the syrupy schmaltz is kept to a minimum. Its probably the last great National Lampoon vacation film made.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1250,5,mark.waltz,Has this stood the test of time 30 Christmas seasons later?,5/10,23 December 2018,"Certainly there are many things here that movie fans can identify with in dealing with crazy families over the holidays, and there definitely are dozens of laughs to be found as well as a few poignant moments. But does the character of Clark Griswold, played with overconfident bravado by Chevy Chase really make for a likeable hero? Even in the first scene with the Griswolds family out to get their Christmas tree, Clark comes off is a pompous jerk with no common sense who makes a fool out of himself and certainly wouldn't be an influence I want my children to have, let alone the sensible wife play by the gorgeous Beverly D'Angelo.Then, there are the relatives. Doris Roberts, John Randolph, Diane Ladd and E.G. Marshall are all given unique eccentricities as the parents, with Randy Quaid returning as an obnoxious cousin who plans his dilapidated trailer outside Clark's middle-class neighborhood. Obnoxious and pretentious neighbors get the worst of it with their stereo destroyed by a flying icicle, and the stench of Quaid's emptying of the trailer toilets into the local drainage ditch. then, there's Clark's awaiting his Christmas bonus from a Scrooge like boss who barely acknowledges his existence.The scene-stealing Mae Questel comes in late in the film, along with William Hickey, as elderly members of the family who are probably celebrating their last Christmas. The cute Questel steals every moment whether saying grace or breaking into sudden song. A particularly gruesome funny moments involving a family cat may disturb some, but has stood the test of time in being one of the all-time great visual gags. Had Chase toned down his character's obnoxiousness, scenes of him watching old Christmas family films might have been more touching, but his persona is one that only holds up in small doses. Even though it isn't quite as funny on repeat viewings, it is certainly better than a lot of the garbage made today celebrating the holidays that lack any sort of heart.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1251,6,kosmasp,Tis the season to be ...,9/10,9 June 2020,"... crazy? At least at the brink of madness at times. Chevy Chase as Mr. Griswold .. not few will remember those names. I reckon some might have wanted to be in the extended and already big Griswold family alltogether. Now I might have rewatched this out of season, but I do think it works no matter what time of the year it is.And that is what makes this a great comedy. Also the actors and the script involved! Some jokes may be a bit .. well don't be too woke about certain things or too PC. Also yes some are just plain silly and there is a lot of don't try this at home stuff. It's a movie, try to accept it (like when Chevy is in the attic and sets his chair in the one spot where it makes no sense at all, other than to get a laugh out of the audience).So great cast and good natured humor. What else do you need?

1252,7,gavin6942,One of the Better National Lampoon Films,7/10,22 December 2012,"The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big disaster.How do you beat this? Frank Capra III helping to direct, John Hughes writing and Angelo Badalamenti on the score? There is no way these three folks could make a bad movie. Then throw in Chevy Chase, Brian Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bill Hickey and Randy Quaid... you have an instant classic.I could maybe have done without Juliette Lewis. I mean, she has her moments, but how did she get to be in this film? Being the daughter of Geoffrey Lewis? It certainly was not her work being Wayne's girlfriend on ""The Wonder Years"". Oh well. At least she went on to do better things.Today, the film is considered a modern Christmas classic, and I would have to agree. It also is a strong third entry in the franchise, second only to the original. Ebert wrote, ""The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work."" I have to say, I think he was wrong.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1253,8,lee_eisenberg,"Happy holidays, everyone!",7/10,10 March 2006,"It seems to me that they didn't really need another addition to the ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" series after the second one, but this one is zany enough to ensure that they still had it going (although I can't quite say the same for part 4). Portraying the Griswolds inviting several relatives to their house for Christmas, the movie portrays one mishap after another (well duh; that's what all of Chevy Chase's movies are). Particularly hilarious are the sled scene, the light scene, the squirrel scene, and Clark's rant after he finds out about his Christmas bonus.It's weird to think that among the relatives invited were the ""Prizzi's Honor"" godfather (William Hickey), the voice of Betty Boop (Mae Questel), the ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" mom (Doris Roberts), and of course Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid). All in all, ""Christmas Vacation"" is enough to put anyone in a holiday mood, even if it involves getting perpetually embarrassed.

1254,9,jboothmillard,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,4/10,4 July 2021,"The original Vacation movie was good fun, while the sequel European Vacation was alright, I had seen the poster for this seasonal sequel several times, as well as clips on TV, I was hoping it would be a good laugh, written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, Beethoven), directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (Benny & Joon). Basically, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) hopes to have a great Christmas with his entire family home in Chicago. He and his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) are looking forward to the festivities, but daughter Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) are uninterested. The Griswolds drive out to the country to find a tree, only to realise too late that they have no saw. Clark finds the biggest tree he can see, and they are forced to pull it down themselves and strap it to the roof of the car. Soon after, Clark's parents, father Clark, Sr. (John Randolph) and Nora (Diane Ladd), and Ellen's parents, father Art (E. G. Marshall) and mother Francis (Doris Roberts), arrive for Christmas, but their bickering quickly begins to annoy the family. Clark, however, maintains a positive attitude, determined to have a ""fun old-fashioned family Christmas"". He covers the whole of the house exterior with 25,000 twinkle lights, which fail to work at first, as he has accidentally wired them through his garage's light switch. When they finally come on, they temporarily cause a citywide power shortage and create chaos for yuppie neighbours the Chesters, Todd (Nicholas Guest) and Margo (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). While standing on the front lawn to admire the lights, Clark is shocked to see, arriving unannounced, Ellen's redneck cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her husband Eddie (Randy Quaid), and their children, Rocky (Cody Burger) and Ruby Sue (Ellen Latzen), and their Rottweiler dog, Snot. Eddie later admits that they are broke and living in the RV they arrived in, after being forced to sell their home. Clark offers to buy gifts for Eddie's kids so they can still enjoy Christmas. Soon afterward, Clark's senile Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel) and grumpy Uncle Lewis (William Hickey) arrive as well. Clark desperately needs his yearly bonus to pay for the instalment a swimming pool for the coming summer, and he questions his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) about why has not given it to him. The family dinner on Christmas Eve is disaster, with Bethany's cat getting electrocuted and Uncle Lewis accidentally burning down the Christmas tree while lighting his cigar. A company messenger soon arrives with an envelope, after failing to deliver it the day before. Clark assumes it will be his bonus, but it is a free year's membership for the ""Jelly of the Month Club"". Clark finally snaps and goes into a tirade about Frank, and in anger says he wants to see him delivered to the house, wrapped in a bow, so Clark can insult him to his face. Eddie takes this literally, drives to Frank's mansion, and kidnaps him. While tied up, Frank admits to cancelling the Christmas bonuses, and Clark berates him for doing so. Meanwhile, Frank's wife, Helen (Natalia Nogulich), calls the police, and a SWAT team surrounds the Griswold house, holding everyone at gunpoint. Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the SWAT leader, both of whom scold him for his decision to scrap the bonuses. Frank decides to reinstate the bonuses, with Clark getting a bonus equal to the amount the year before, plus 20% as compensation. The family heads outside when Rocky and Ruby Sue believe they see Santa Claus in the distance. Clark tells them it is the Christmas Star and that he finally realises what the holiday means to him. Uncle Lewis says the light is coming from the sewage treatment plant, reminding Clark that Eddie had been dumping sewage from his RV into the nearby storm drain. Before Clark can stop him, Uncle Lewis tosses a match used to light his cigar into the drain, triggering an explosion, which sends a Santa's sleigh decoration flying into the sky. Aunt Bethany starts singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and everyone joins in as the flaming decoration flies into the distance. The entire family and the SWAT team members then celebrate inside the house, while Clark and Ellen happily share a Christmas kiss, and Clark stands outside satisfied that he provided a great Christmas for his family. Also starring Sam McMurray as Bill. Chase as the accident-prone father is on good form, as is D'Angelo as his tested wife, and Quaid is memorable as the obnoxious relative. The disaster prone Oswold family may be staying home for the holidays, but even the simplest tasks like hanging out the lights turn into overly silly slapstick fodder, it is predictable and gets sentimental towards the end, but this is one the earliest examples of Christmas going wrong in a movie, and it works relatively well, not a bad comedy.

1255,10,BA_Harrison,A Christmas cracker with genuinely funny jokes.,8/10,20 December 2009,"If you're stuck for gift ideas for that special someone this Christmas, why not give them the gift of laughter with the Chevy Chase comedy classic 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? Heartwarming and hilarious, this festive favourite will guarantee a very merry time.Chase plays Clark Griswold, a well intentioned family man whose plans for the perfect Christmas go disastrously wrong: the thousands of lights that adorn his home refuse to work; his in-laws argue with his parents; the Christmas tree goes up in flames; he is trapped in the attic while hiding his gifts; a sledging incident almost costs him his life; the turkey is overdone; his embarrassing hick relatives turn up expectedly for the holidays; a wild squirrel invades the home; and worst of all, his bonus cheque seems to have gone missing in the post.Naturally, by the time Christmas Day arrives, Clark is a complete nervous wreck, and when he discovers that his Christmas bonus is a 'year's membership to a jelly club', rather than the expected cash bonus, his temper finally snaps (of course, this being a good natured Christmas tale, everything turns out right in the end, thanks to the intervention of dumb, but well-meaning Cousin Eddie).Written by 80s comedy genius John Hughes, Christmas Vacation's script is bristling with very funny lines of dialogue, but it is the visual gags that get the biggest laughs: Clark somehow driving the family saloon between the wheels of a huge truck; the bushy tailed rodent clinging to Clark's back; the sight of Clark careering across a freeway on a well oiled sled. Chase gives one of his most memorable performances, making Clark a thoroughly likable character that one can't help but admire, despite his failures, and he is given able support by a superb cast that includes Beverly D'Angelo as his long suffering wife Ellen, Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter Audrey.And the best thing about the film?

1256,11,paul_haakonsen,It was an ugly tree anyway...,8/10,2 May 2017,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a Christmas classic, and there is no denying it. It is one of those movies that you just have to watch year after year come Christmas time. And the movie never gets old, no matter how many times you have seen it.Following in the tradition of the previous ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" movies, also starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, the 1989 ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is every bit as hilarious, enjoyable and entertaining as the previous movies. And if you have seen the previous movies, which I assume you have as they are also classics, then you will immediately love ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" as well.The Griswold family is hosting a big family gathering for the Christmas holidays and have everything planned out, from decorating the house to the grand feast. But of course everything goes awry for Clark and the family, true to the Griswold family streak of bad luck and misfortune.What works out so well for ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a combination of things. First of all, the storyline is good and hilarious, with some truly wonderful situations playing out on the screen. But it is also a gallery of some magnificent characters with lots of personalities and quirks, and it is characters that easily can be identified with members of your own family. And it is, of course, also the comedy that is ever-present throughout the entire movie. There are so many laughs throughout the entire movie, and it is fabulous because it is laughs that you enjoy every year as you watch this Christmas classic.Chevy Chase is of course the embodiment of Clark W. Griswold and he carries this role with grace and perfection. And Beverly D'Angelo is right alongside him in her role as Ellen Griswold, his wife. And she not only compliments Chevy Chase, but she also stands her own ground quite well. Furthermore there are great performances by Johnny Galecki, Juliette Lewis, Randy Quaid, Doris Roberts, John Randolph and William Hickey to name but a few of the performers who shine here in this movie.""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" has truly withstood the test of time and stands out as a classic movie to brighten up Christmas year after year.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

There are so many laughs to go around (thanks to writer John Hughes) that it boggles the mind (and it might be the final time Checy Chase brings belly laughs).  Here, the Griswalds don't go on a vacation, but instead the family stays in Chicago where there relatives come to town and hell will come too.  Randy Quaid makes this film a treat by having just laugh out loud moments on the screen.  Great fun for the whole family (I think).  A+

This is one of the comedy Christmas classics. With a great cast and many jokes.Actually, the humor is not always my thing. I am not a big fan of slapstick comedy. Animals being hurt just makes me cringe and I need a bit more to laugh but people falling or a table break down. But it still has some good moments.One thin that bothered me the most was the lack of participation by most family members. It is such a great cast but we don't see much of them besides Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid (and both were great). I was excited to see Doris Roberts, but she basically got nothing to say or do, I felt it was such a waste.As usual when watching older movies it was fun to see actors I know in their earlier roles. One would be Johnny Galecki whom I wouldn't recognize if I wouldn't see his name.I am probably more generous to this movie than I should be. If it wasn't a Christmas movie it would probably get a 6 from me, but it is just a part of the Holiday season that is worth watching. It has the usual ""family is more important on Christmas than anything else"" message, and I rather get it from this movie than It's a Wonderful life.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

It's broadly funny, it's sentimental, it's got some nice set piece moments.I think your enjoyment of this film largely comes down to whether you find Chevy Chase funny. I did not. I spent most of the film wondering which modern actors could do this better. Apart from falling on his face or widening his eyes, I didn't find Chase that funny.In fact the supporting case are the ones who take most of the laughs, with Doris Roberts in particular being a good example.If it's your favourite Christmas film then don't listen to me, go and enjoy it.

1261,16,Scarecrow-88,Christmas Vacation,9/10,15 December 2010,"If there ever was someone who understood the effects of Murphy's Law it's the always-maligned Clark Griswold who just wanted the perfect family Christmas and instead is leveled with one disaster after another. If Clark isn't battle scarred from putting up Christmas lights, he's contending with problems with the tree. Bickering relatives, long-awaited bonus(which doesn't turn out to be what Clark was hoping for so he could pay for a new pool), Cousin Eddie, getting locked in the attic while the family is gone(not to mention getting smacked in the face with the attic latter and falling out altogether while watching old family reels on the projector), an overcooked turkey, Cousin Eddie, a sled ride that goes terribly wrong..did I mention Cousin Eddie? With plenty of Chevy Chase zingers(his demand at the end that no one leaves when all is not well, what he'd like to tell his (insert insults here) boss who screwed him over regarding the late ""bonus"", and especially his comments about Eddie), slapstick, and one hell of a supporting cast, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" stands the test of time as a real comedy Christmas classic worth revisiting every single year. The mayhem brought on by one nightmarish scenario after another(the tree going up in flames thanks to Uncle Lewis' cigar, the cat getting ""lit up"" when Clark plugs in the lights, Eddie filling the Griswold sewer with ""toxic s#it"", a runaway squirrel causing the family to panic, etc.)provides plenty of chuckles. Before this film John Hughes was mainly putting out teenage fare, but afterward you'd have other Christmas slapstick comedies like HOME ALONE where destruction in a cartoony fashion would erupt on the unlucky. Probably the last great comedy Chase would be a part of; the next decade wasn't as kind as the 80s.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1262,17,Hey_Sweden,"Endearing entry in the ""Vacation"" series.",8/10,7 December 2011,"Third ""Vacation"" movie finds star Chevy Chase in fine form, as perpetually stubborn Clark W. Griswold is determined to have a happy holiday at home with the family and the in-laws. What he didn't count on was the return of his cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, full of all the expected swagger and an absolute hoot), the ultimate hick, who brings along his family and his dog in an RV.What's great about this movie is how likable it remains even as it comes up with one ridiculous (yet funny) setback after another. The in-laws aren't the only things Clark will have to contend with: there will also be an incident on the road with some redneck drivers, the attack of a psychotic squirrel, Eddie dumping his sewage into the storm drain, the inability to get Clarks' elaborately decorated house to light up, a pair of snot nosed, disapproving neighbours (one of them played by a pre-'Seinfeld' Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and a Yuletide visit by the local SWAT team!One has to admire Clark: he soldiers on, running on a lot of heart even if he doesn't quite have the brains to match, and when he loses it in a couple of memorable, hysterical rants, they can't help but feel some sympathy for this guy. Director Jeremiah Chechik, working from a screenplay by John Hughes (who'd written the first ""Vacation"" and co-written the second), does a great job of mixing some genuinely poignant moments into all of the farcical highlights. There's some very quotable dialogue, especially from Clark and Eddie.It's great fun, too, to see so many familiar faces in this large cast; lovely Beverly D'Angelo is fine as usual as the long suffering wife Ellen; also appearing are Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki as the latest incarnations of Audrey and Rusty, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Miriam Flynn, William Hickey, Sam McMurray, Nicholas Guest, and Natalia Nogulich. Mae Questel, long ago voice of Betty Boop, is a riot.Christmastime simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of this personal favourite. It starts out brightly and keeps the momentum going for a very enjoyable 98 minutes. In the words of Eddie, it's the gift that keeps on giving.Eight out of 10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1263,18,Doylenf,Gathering of the Griswold clan for Christmas is dangerously funny...,7/10,23 December 2011,"Chevy Chase lends his abundant comic talents to a tale where everything that could possibly go wrong does, while preparing his house for a gathering of the Griswold clan for a typical American Christmas. He goes overboard, believing that he's about to receive a nice Christmas bonus. The nerve-wracking turn of events that follow are enough to create havoc when he almost suffers a nervous breakdown before a happy ending.Lots of sight gags enliven a cheerful script by John Hughes, many having to do with the lights going up all over the housetop and walls as our hero prepares to illuminate the neighborhood with lights and music. Naturally, almost every attempt fails until someone accidentally turns on the main switch.Funniest moments come after the arrival of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who really gets into the spirit of the farce with an engaging hillbilly performance as the head of a family of rednecks. Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall add their own bits of amusement and a senile granny, played by the woman who voiced Betty Boop, offers her own brand of clownish behavior.Summing up: Could have been better, but brightens the holiday mood with some shenanigans about eccentric relatives that just about anyone can relate to.Chevy Chase, as the fumbling and enthusiastic do-gooder, takes the Scrooge out of Christmas with some very entertaining, if somewhat improbable over-the-top antics and Beverly D'Angelo is charming and patient as his long-suffering wife.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1264,19,Bunuel1976,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S Christmas VACATION (Jeremiah S. Chechik, 1989) **1/2",6/10,3 January 2008,"Maybe it was because I wasn't too much in the mood for this one (my mother had just broken a leg a couple of hours earlier) or perhaps because I was watching it in the wee hours of the morning, or else the fact that I found it too engrossed in the typical American working-man's preoccupationsbut, the point, is that this would-be modern Christmas comedy classic seemed to me to be little more than a mildly amusing affair. Having said that, this is only the second NATIONAL LAMPOON film I've watched – after the similarly overrated ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) – and the film itself is the third VACATION with Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo playing the Griswolds.The film starts amiably enough with the amusing animated opening credits, the car chase and tree cutting sequences but slowly starts going downhill once the other members of the family come into the picture. Apart from the fact that it seemed exaggerated to me to have relatives calling at the house for the Christmas dinner from a couple of weeks earlier, Chevy's ""losing it completely"" antics after not getting his all-important (why?) Christmas bonus were pretty over-the-top as well. The ultra-illuminated house gag also outstayed its welcome as did Randy Quaid's rude Cousin Eddiealthough the fried cat bit was funny, as were the perennially ill-fated neighbors. Even so, the supporting cast is surprisingly good: Juliette Lewis (as the Griswold's daughter), John Randolph and Diane Ladd (as the elder Griswolds), E.G. Marshall (as D' Angelo's unimpressed father), William Hickey (as the cigar-smoking, toupee-wearing uncle) and Mae Questel (as the senile aunt).",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Who would not prefer Juliette Lewis over Dana Hill for the part of Audrey?It seems that writer John Hughes entered a more physical comedy stage of his career that we'd see in ""Uncle Buck"" and the two ""Home Alones."" I guess watching ""Christmas Vacation"" after the three aforementioned movies made ""Christmas Vacation"" somewhat hohum.Instead of being on the road making a fool of himself and screwing things up, Clark is at home doing that. To be fair, he did have the help of his off kilter family, but Clark is still the sultan of screw-ups. There were some laughs to be had though I felt like I'd seen much of the material before. Christmas is supposed to be a time of holiday cheer except I didn't find myself cheering too much.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Clark, however, is determined to make things work and for starters he heads out into the country with his wife and two children to find the perfect Christmas tree. After trekking quite a bit in the snow they finally come upon a gigantic one only to discover that they forgot to bring an axe with them. On a similar note, even though Ellen tells him that the tree is much too big to fit in the house Clark sloughs off her remark and after uprooting it eventually manages to bring it home where, sure enough, it doesn't fit in the house. Things then quickly go downhill once both sets of parents arrive-along with various other family members who show up unannounced. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-like the other two films that preceded it-this picture had some good moments here and there and was fairly entertaining. There were other scenes, however, which weren't that funny and because of that the film seem somewhat uneven overall. Even so, it's still good for a few laughs and I have rated it accordingly.

Clark W. Griswold desires a holiday Christmas at home with extended family but everything goes wrong. Chevy Chase delivers several great physical jokes including a sled race that goes beyond fast. As Clark he awaits his bonus so to surprise the family with a swimming pool. He goes beyond standard family procedure especially when lighting the house. Beverly D'Angelo returns as his loyal and sensible wife Ellen who tries to make sense of Clark's mishaps. Randy Quaid steals every scene he is in as redneck cousin Eddie who arrives in a beat up R.V, and delivers some of the best lines. One element of concern is too many characters to really advance although William Hickey as Uncle Lewis is a steal when he accidentally burns down the tree. Everyone else is a role call of great talent with a few lines and moments but little development. Not for children due to adult humour including a controversial scene involving an electrocuted cat. This film is filled with great moments and non stop laughs while presenting a sense of normality within its setting. The result is a grand way to spend the holidays.

1269,24,FlashCallahan,Eat my rubber.....,9/10,8 December 2012,"It's Christmas time - Clark decides to invite all the family to have 'the most fun-filled old- fashioned family Christmas', which nobody shall ever forget. When the first relatives arrive, Clark soon flees on the roof to rig the lighting. The one thing the loving father wants to surprise the whole family with is the installation of a pool, which he already ordered. Unfortunately, the bonus cheque Clark expects any minute is overdue - and tempers rise, but not only because of the cheque. A big event is the arrival of uninvited cousin Eddie with his family in their mobile home, as well as a little sledding afternoon with a new lubricant from Clark's company, or his shifting relationship with the very hip and clean neighbours. Cousin Eddie chooses to top off all presents with his very own special creation, only intending to deliver a real reason to be jolly......After nearly 23 years, this is one of the last 'traditional Christmas films' released, before we had a slew of self referential and ironic, Christmas movies.It's also easily the best Vacation movie, and in my opinion, Chases finest movie. It's hilarious and also one of the very few films that actually gives you a Christmas fuzzy feeling inside.Plot wise, there is no plot, it's just basically a series of sketches that build up to a family dinner, with a subplot of a bonus cheque waiting to arrive.The cast are great, and although it has a very eighties feel to it, it still feels very fresh when you watch it year after year, and it never gets boring.See it, and get that warm feeling inside every single time.A true Christmas classic.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1270,25,Aaron1375,"Funny xmas movie featuring the Griswolds...however, it gets to sentimental at times.",7/10,30 November 2008,"Just because it is a Christmas movie I am afraid they do go a bit heavy at times on the sentimental stuff. The movie has the Griswolds, not going on a family trip of any kind, but rather having a nice family vacation right in their own home. You know the type, the one where everyone comes together to celebrate the xmas season together as the parents of both spouses are there. You know the type, hell in your house type scenario. Why anyone would subject themselves to the kind of torture that can only come from having as many family members under one roof is beyond me. We also know the Griswolds do not have the best track record when it comes to planning that perfect vacation. Not only do they have trouble getting a tree right from the get go they also have pandemonium when the in-laws arrive. Clark has run ins with his yuppie neighbors, of course he would be living by people like this. It always seems people who like to decorate their house get stuck by the ones who like the minimal xmas and vice versa and boy does Clark believe in a lot of lights. Of course, once he gets them all put up there is a bit of a trick to getting them on. Then guess who stops by, but the relatives that are not invited in the form of good ol cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid stealing the show a bit in this one). So there you have it, a more realistic movie than European to be sure, but I still liked it a bit better and of this one the first one and European I like this one the least. Never saw Vegas, from the previews it did not look all that good to me. However, this one is still funny and even though I consider it the weakest it is actually rather strong for a xmas movie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

I later saw the original film. Anyway, this film is great about Clark's ideal Christmas holiday with the family around. The only problem is that nothing ever goes right for him just like his vacations. Anyway, a great cast including Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as the Griswolds. The kids are played by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki. THe visiting family members are played by Doris Roberts, John Randolph, Diane Ladd, and E.G. Marshall. You can't forget Cousin Eddie played by Randy Quaid and his wife Kathryn played by Miriam Flynn. The film is always a treat around the Holiday season. It reminds us that no family is perfect and problems often arise. As John Randolph's character, Mr. Griswold replies ""I had help from Jack Daniels."" Of course, I can't forget Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing the snobby yuppie neighbor. I also liked watching Bill Hickey and Mae Questal as the older family relatives who come on Christmas Eve. It's always worth the laughs.

1272,27,SimonJack,The most laughs of any holiday movie,10/10,1 February 2015,"Going back to the 1930s, Hollywood has produced some very good humorous holiday films. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has more laughs than any that I have seen. Year after year, this movie continues to regale me over the holidays. Come Thanksgiving each year, I start checking my DVD list and begin playing my favorite holiday flicks. I like to save Christmas Vacation until close to Christmas. After my children and their families have finished most of the hectic shopping for Christmas, this is a good film to sit down to for some laughs. This is an adult film – in much of the humor and some of the language and actions. We will show it to kids when they reach their teens, with explanations and reminders about foul language or disrespectful parts. There is a genius in the writing of this film that combines occasional witty dialog with side talking built around slapstick and other situations. The situations and characters are sources of many laughs. It's all built around Clark Griswold, played to perfection by Chevy Chase. This is one of those rare original films that makes a hit and lasts so long that no one would think to try to do a remake. Indeed, who could equal or top the humor of this story as given us by this great cast? I can't imagine Clark Griswold as anyone other than Chevy Chase. Or Eddie played by anyone other than Randy Quaid. Or even the yuppie neighbors, Todd and Margo as played by Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis- Dreyfus, respectively. All the cast contribute to the humor, but it all revolves around Clark Griswold. This is a wonderful laugh-out-loud comedy that never seems to wear out. Of course it might if one were to play it incessantly during the year, instead of holding it for the holidays.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

It's the sort of movie you take to as a kid when you hear your dad howling at almost every turn. But it took a hefty 40 minutes of running time for Randy Quaid to mosey in and finally get the ball rolling. ""Stole the show"" is an understatement; he's the reason to sit though this.As a ""Vacation"" entry, it follows the formula to a T: Chevy Chase gets the ideal Christmas into his head, puts himself through hell getting it with a series of destructively poor decisions, sentimental lessons are learned. But the jokes are painfully forced. Cousin Eddie and Clark losing it are both peaks, but it's mostly valleys; gags that are obvious and still lack the satisfying dividends.I'm onboard with most of the holiday classics, but this is one that loses me.5/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1276,31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Merrry Christmas from Chevy Chase!,10/10,19 January 2004,"I don't know how anyone could ever go in life without seeing Christmas Vacation, it's one of the necessary movies you have to watch during the holidays. The reason being is that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. Who hasn't had their crazy family over during the holiday season? Well, that's Christmas Vacation, one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You think that Vacation topped it off with the laughs, believe me when I say that you've seen nothing yet. With an all star cast that clicked so well, you couldn't go wrong going on a great Christmas Vacation with the Griswolds.Clark Griswold has really got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed that. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Art and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. But in spite of all the good intentions and careful planning, Christmas plans start to go awry: crazy squirrels, SWAT teams, burning Christmas trees, an over cooked turkey and of course a visit from the world's favorite white trash with a heart of gold Cousin Eddie! A Christmas ride not to be missed with the Griswold family.One of the things I just adore about this movie is the little touches they put in the film: the grandparents falling asleep to an old Christmas movie playing on TV, the anxiety you feel as the doorbell rings knowing who's going to be behind it, and the little awkwardness during dinner when you hear everyone chewing their food. Chevy Chase is still such a pervert of course going for the hot sales lady instead of Cristy Brinkley this time, but you can't help but love and laugh at his fantasy in the back yard while the whole family is swimming in his most wanted work bonus: a family sized pool. He maybe a crazy pervert at times, but you feel the love he has for his family and how badly he wants Christmas to be perfect.There are some great laughs in this movie: a squirrel gets caught in the Christmas tree that Clark brings in and it attacks the family and neighbors! Clark gets upset that there is no Christmas bonus so his cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss, wraps him in a bow and gives him to Clark so he could kick him in the butt! A cat chews on the Christmas lights and gets electrocuted under the chair. But if you also get past all the slap stick humor, you still feel the Christmas message at the end, that despite all the craziness that comes around Christmas, don't forget what it's really about: peace and love. A wonderful ending and a perfect movie for Christmas that I watch every year, Christmas Vacation is definitely in Santa's movie collection somewhere.10/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

This film is a must see during the holiday season, the laughs just get you into the spirit of Christmas so much! You again have the comedy legend himself Chevy Chase returning for a third round in the Lampoon Vacation series, this time the theme is Christmas. As anybody knows when you have a Hughes film and another vacation film with Chase you will have plenty of slapstick comedy and laughs! Clark Griswold(Chevy Chase) vows his clan will enjoy the most fun-filled family Christmas ever! So oh boy get ready for the crazy mishaps, just scene after scene is hilarious, some of my favorites are when Clark gets tongue-tied in the shopping mall at a lingerie counter in front of that sexy female clerk! Also inside the home once the family gathers around the crazy scene of 25,000 lights on the roof. The family Christmas eve dinner is just a mess from an exploding turkey to cat food mixed in the jello! The living room and the Christmas tree don't have any better luck either, as the family experiences capital punishment on a cat, and a forest fire on a Christmas tree! A merry and jolly supporting cast make this film enjoyable also as Beverly D' Angelo is back as Clark's cool wife and Juliette Lewis is adorable as Clark's teen daughter. The rest of the family clan is played perfect by veterans like John Randolph, E.G. Marshall and William Hickey who all in my mind are legends. Just to mention crazy country cousin Eddie returns and he's around for the holiday as always this character is played just fine by Randy Quaid. Before her big fame, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a small part as Clark's snobbish sexy black bra wearing next door neighbor! Overall this film is a script full of wit, and fine moments just like when Clark has memories watching old holiday films in the attic!

1278,33,MovieAddict2016,"""Overall, 'Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with 'Home Alone' and 'Gremlins'""",10/10,23 February 2003,"National Lampoon's Christmas VacationIn this third installment of the widely successful and popular `Vacation' franchise, Chevy Chase returns to his role of Clark Griswold, along with Beverly D'Angelo as his wife Ellen. Also along for the ride is Randy Quaid, reprising his role as Uncle Eddie from the first film.`Christmas Vacation' doesn't really take the same formula as the first `Vacation' film, but it certainly is as funny. What I mean when I say, `The formula isn't the same,' is that the original film was about a family taking a road trip across America; the humor was restricted to jokes regarding road travel. The second film did the same, but became tiresome after a while.Now, `Christmas' works in the restraints of not a road travel comedy, but of a Christmas comedy: the family coming, the frustrations and aggravations ofChristmas! But also, the film captures the pure joy of Christmas at the same time, as the first film did with traveling.Perhaps the fact that John Hughes, writer of `Vacation,' wrote this film; I feel he did so because he wanted to get the series back on track after the first sequel. In an interview once, James Cameron said of `Terminator 2': `I knew the sequel would be made; I wanted to carry it on in the right direction and not let it stray from the right path' or something vaguely familiar to that. I feel that is what John Hughes did with this film. I think, in his mind, he thought this would be the last sequel, and he wanted to end it with a bang. Of course, almost a decade later in 1997, audiences were introduced to `Vegas Vacation,' which is, in my opinion, an underrated comedy, but I'll get into that in my next `Vacation' review.Clark Griswold has finally settled in for a peaceful Christmas with his family, including children Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki). The family is coming, including Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph), Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), Art (E.G. Marshall), and Doris Roberts as loudmouth Frances.Only this year, Clark has made sure that EVERYTHING will go as planned. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us (very much so!), Clark's planning will be to no avail, as everything, much the same in the previous films, will go to pieces and this Christmas will be just as crazy as the Christmases before.Chevy Chase found his roots in the `Vacation' films; I really do not enjoy him as a regular actor/comedian, but he is perfect as Clark Griswold. He is extremely gung-ho, and has all these crazy notions and the idea of an absolute perfect vacation built up in his head, and it is more than enjoyable as we watch them wither away while he loses his cool.
Beverly D'Angelo is, as I said in my review on the first film, surprisingly convincing as a housewife. I would never expect for her to work as an average mother, but behold, she does.The kids in this new movie are good. They may not be as great as Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron were, but their attitudes fit the characters for THIS script much better: Audrey has a bigger attitude and Rusty is younger and more innocent.And in this movie, the filmmakers return to what helped make the first movie so good: Cousin Eddie. I think his lack of presence in the second film really harmed its reputation, but this film brings him back in a hilarious introduction sequence outside the house (`Eddie?!).All in all, the film has some excellent gags and parodies the Christmas season we all go through very, very well. While I don't think it is quite as good as the first `Vacation' movie, it is almost as good. The reason it's hard to evaluate in comparison is because it is so different from the original; the formula as I said before is entirely different.
In fact, director Jeremiah S. Chechik seems to give the film an entirely different overtone. The first film had an orange tint to it, in a way, because it took place in summer and the Griswold family drove through some very dry areas. In this movie, it is Christmas, and the cinematography isbleaker? Weighed down? Darker? Not in a bad way, in a good way. It suits the film. But all these little tidbits make it harder to efficiently compare the two films together because they are so different.Overall, `Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with `Home Alone.' It just parodies the season we all love so well, that it has become, for me, a Christmas tradition. I watch it at LEAST once a year around Christmas, but usually five, six, maybe seven times a year. Sometime I'm going to have to buy it on DVD and stop watching a taped NBC broadcast of the film.`Christmas Vacation' gets 4.5/5 stars from me  it's a great satire.John Ulmer",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1280,35,disdressed12,funny and realistic,8/10,1 January 2010,"just finished watching this Christmas classic with my roommate,and,i have to say,i really enjoyed it.not only is it funny.but it's also pretty realistic in terms of how people relate to their families from their immediate family to their close relatives,distant relatives and their in laws during the holiday season,especially if they are all under the same roof.things can get a bit hairy.most people will be able to relate to Clark Griswald and what he has to deal with.i also likes the fact that the movie is very low on the syrupy sweetness that many holiday movies fall prey to.this is really just a movie that doesn't try to be anything more than it is.fun entertainment that people can relate to.for me,Christmas Vacation is an 8/10.

1281,36,OllieSuave-007,Tis the season with lots of laughs!,7/10,20 August 2014,"This is one of the handful of comedies I remembered watching when I was a kid. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a Christmas comedy featuring the Griswolds trying to celebrate the holiday at their home with a joyous family get-together, but they only run into bad luck and disastrous events one after the other.This movie is one with some feel-good holiday cheer and laugh-out-loud humor. You will get dry absurdity and slapstick comic relief all bundled in one big laugh fest, including the hilarious mishaps when the family attempts to put up the huge Christmas tree in their living room to the Christmas lights decoration debacle. The filmmakers could have, though, lighten on the crude innuendos, which I think are out of place for a holiday movie.Overall, it is a somewhat fun story full of hilarious surprises and off-the-chart characters, with a touch of dramatic moments and complete absurdity. It's not a film for everybody of all ages at your own Christmas get-together, but one to watch along or with a few friends if you need some cheering up.

1282,37,sddavis63,"My Favourite ""Vacation"" Movie And One Of My Favourite Christmas Movies",8/10,1 December 2011,"It may well be because going to see this movie at a theatre in the east end of Toronto was the first date that I ever went on with my now wife of over 20 years, but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation will always own a piece of my heart! I have watched this many, many times since that first date - I wouldn't say every Christmas season, but probably most - and it never, ever gets stale. Even though there are parts of the dialogue I now know off by heart it still makes me laugh. Chevy Chase was born to play Clark Griswold. He's had the character nailed perfectly since his first appearance, and this is no exception. Clark is such a lovable guy. He's kind of irritating, he's a bit clumsy, he overdoes everything and he grumbles (and sometimes worse) a lot of the time, but he's a good guy. That side of him really comes out in this movie. Clark might grumble, but he loves having the family around him - even cousin Eddie (who thankfully returns after being absent from European Vacation) although he likely wouldn't admit it. He not only loves having his family around him, he loves his family - all of them. It's a simple scene, like the one in which he has his heart to heart chat with Eddie's little girl Ruby Sue about Santa Claus, that shows that off. He might look put off when Eddie goes overboard with his requests for Christmas presents after Clark tells him he'll buy them for him since Eddie has no money, but you know he doesn't really mind doing it. I like Clark. I'd be buddies with Clark.There's so much going on in this movie that works so well. The chaotic family gathering is really nothing more than a deliberate exaggeration of the experience so many people have in getting their families (in all their diversity) together for the holidays - which means that in a bizarre sort of way it's pretty easy to relate to. Then there's Clark's struggles with getting the 25,000 lights he's decorated his house with to turn on; the understandable frustrations of the neighbours in having to deal with this insane family living next door; the wild sled ride. And there's the cat. Oh the cat. The poor, poor cat! It's funny.Strangely, the weakest parts to this for me at least were the beginning and the end. Both seemed to go a little overboard. The battle with the truck driver at the beginning of the movie as the Griswold's were heading out to get their Christmas tree really doesn't grab me - in fact it comes across as silly (and not in a good way) - and the end, where cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss and brings him back to the house just seemed too much. But everything in between is astonishingly funny and well done. (8/10)",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1283,38,thesar-2,National Lampoon's Staycation,6/10,25 December 2012,"First, they went cross-country to Magic Mountain, er Walley World. Next, Europe. What's to top that for the Griswold's? Why, they stay home, of course.I don't wish to sound negative upfront, but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation really didn't hold up for me today. I LOVED this movie as a kid – I did watch it repeatedly back then, but after a nearly 15 year hiatus of not seeing it, it felt really dated to me.That said, I still laughed, admired the cartoonish feel they gave to these live-action characters and the scenes of genuine heart. I would still recommend it, especially for fans of Clark Griswold and his crazy antics and it still remains as my favorite Vacation movie.I'm not 100% sure there really is a plot here, but the premise is Clark and Co. are determined to have a true family Christmas, but are consistently sidetracked with annoying relatives, angry neighbors, mischievous animals and a stereotypical Hollywood ""Christmas boss.""Despite the lack of any real script, the movie does have focus and a lot of fun. It's slapstick and silly and actually tugs at your heart at times. It's not a movie to take seriously and if you just sit back and enjoy, you'll really have a good time.Side Note and Spoiler – skip this paragraph if you have not seen it: Maybe I noticed this before, but I really don't recall: how they ended the movie without even making it to Christmas Day was thoroughly disappointing. It was as if they knew the movie was running too long, and it was, and cut it short of the actual day the movie's based on. And titled as such. Sad.Side Note II: I also might not have noticed this before, but the boy who replaced the boy who replaced the original Griswold son, Rusty, was played by long time crush of mine: (just one-year-younger than me) Johnny Galecki. It was truly weird seeing someone that I've grown to like a lot since I've last see this film, as a freaking boy. Thankfully, that's not how I remember him these days.Side Note III: Speaking of the children, since this movie was released, I have been all-but 100% against seeing Juliette Lewis. I cannot stand her. Even though she plays an integral part, mercifully, she's hardly in this. In fact, Rusty, or Galecki, has more screen time. Perhaps because both his character and lines were a lot funnier.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1284,39,cherold,funny Xmas flick,8/10,29 August 2019,"I saw this movie for the first time in 2017, and it's portrayal of a desperate attempt to recreate a nostalgic white-bread Christmas that never actually existed seem weirdly apropos. But even outside of that this is a very funny movie, as a well-meaning but fairly deluded father puts his children through hell to create a perfect family Christmas with a big tree, a bazillion lights, and goodwill for all, and winds up with electric shocks, a white trash trailer, and vicious squirrels. Chevy Chase shows off a lot of his SNL physical comedy skills as the father, and the rest of the cast is solid, with a notable performance by the original voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl as a hilariously befuddled relative.Even though this is very slapsticky, it still offers the sort of sentimentality required of any Christmas film, giving an underlying sweetness to the movie even as it spreads mayhem and madness.

1285,40,Robert_duder,One of the funniest adult comedies ever made...and a Christmas tradition!!,9/10,21 January 2012,"Adult comedies have changed a lot. Now you're bombarded with the all out R rated horrifying dirty comedies of nowadays. Not all of them are bad if you like that gross out comedy style. But back in the 80's, even the late 80's, adult comedy was a whole different ball game and the National Lampoon Vacation Movies pioneered many of those laughs. Christmas Vacation is definitely unique because I don't believe there were a lot of adult oriented Christmas movies out there. And no matter what anyone else says this an adult comedy. It has bad language, sexual connotations, and just general a lot of adult humour. But it works so well and this film is downright hilarious. The script is just incredibly clever and the film makers let Chevy Chase do exactly what he does best and delivers the dialogue like a comedy legend. The cast works so well together and its such an ensemble cast of wacky and zany characters and you can't help but fall in love with the entire Griswold family. Its a laugh out loud, slapstick, comedy classic.This was Chevy Chase at his best. Even now years later if you see him on Community he still delivers that awkward, gangly everyman type character that delivers outstanding one liners and hilarious dialogue. Clark Griswold is perfect and no one could do that role like Chase. You just love this guy no matter what through all his mistakes and stupid follies. I always thought that Beverly D'Angelo had a strange chemistry with Chevy Chase, they seem like polar opposites but yet their chemistry has always worked for the Vacation movies and still works perfectly in this one. She's definitely the straight man to the entire film and doesn't get a lot of the gags but she is Chevy Chase's perfect partner. Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the Griswold children this time around and they are good and they fulfil their duties appropriately but neither one really stand out. One of the legendary performances in this film is that by Randy Quaid as the infamous Cousin Eddie. Quaid is downright brilliant as the white trash trailer park Cousin with a big heart but no brains. Him and Chase are brilliant together and you can't help but howl at his misfortunes and stupid blunders. The supporting cast are one of the best ensembles in movie history, all bringing about some of the best laughs ever. William Hickey, Mae Questel, Doris Roberts, John Randolph, and Miriam Flynn are a few of the truly stand out performances in supporting roles. Also deserving of mentioning is Brian Doyle-Murray in a small role as Chase's money hungry boss. Two performances that are wasted and pointless are that of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the annoyed neighbours. There is no purpose to them in the film and they are just more annoying than anything.The film makers, led by Canadian director Jeremiah Chechik, packed so much into this movie and yet it doesn't feel crowded. It feels like the perfect Holiday slapstick comedy. You feel like you become one of the Griswold's and partake in every moment of their insane holiday. Ridiculous physical comedy, hilarious chemistry between the cast makes this an absolute must see every Holiday season or even any time. This was director Chechik's debut and its easy to see why he's worked steadily in Hollywood since then, even in Television because he clearly has an eye for making a film feel right, pacing it right, and letting the actors do what they do best. This will make you fall in love with the Griswold's and see the whole series again and again! 9/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1286,41,Lejink,Cold Christmas,3/10,24 December 2009,"A friend of mine called Willie swears this is one of the best, if not THE best Christmas movie ever and gave me his treasured DVD from off his shelf so that I too could share in the fun. However, given that his musical taste runs only as far as Shaking' Stevens and Five Star (in other words naff 80's music), I wasn't hopeful sitting down to watch it on a cold, snowy-outside pre-Christmas night (i.e. everything in its favour!).Having said that, my wife, who loves TV shows like ""You've Been Framed"" featuring the public falling down a lot, laughed quite a lot, but that too is no recommendation. I appreciate that it probably struck and continues to strike a chord with the American public, where massive family re-unions on Christmas Day with the house done up like the Blackpool or Vegas Illuminations are de rigeur (although the latter practice is certainly growing in the UK), but for me, who's never really latched onto the National Lampoon type of humour, I was left colder than a penguin.Chevy Chase does his best with his portrayal of Everyman USA, hoping for his big Christmas bonus from his employer, fantasising about younger women and trying to please everyone in the family, even the black sheep (although in this family, some are blacker than others!) but despite many pratfalls, explosions and embarrassing moments, my funny bone resolutely refused to be tickled.Not much more to say really, other than I'll be watching ""White Christmas"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" over the next two days, where I know I will be transported into the world of Christmas, but this particular damp squib, I'll leave to the very young, very American and Willie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1287,42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Staycation.,5/10,28 December 2020,"Essentially, 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)' is a series of skits surrounding a Christmas-time family get-together that just keeps going wrong. There's a loose plot but not all that much of a narrative, with most sequences seeming like they could work entirely in isolation. The most major problem with the picture is that it just isn't funny. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly 'unfunny' either - I mean, it doesn't make you cringe with its humour or anything like that. It just isn't as successful as it perhaps ought to have been when it comes to the laugh department. It's a passively entertaining experience, the sort of thing that just unfolds before your eyes and doesn't require much thought. It isn't engaging, but it also isn't boring. It's absolutely fine. That's all there is to say about it. 5/10

1288,43,bowmanblue,Still as much fun,8/10,22 December 2017,"I remember renting 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' from a video store back in the late eighties and again in the early nineties (until I figured it was simply more convenient and cost effective to buy a VHS copy and watch it whenever I want). I was young at the time and clearly loved its slightly dumb, cheesy humour (plus I was a fan of the two previous 'Vacation' films, but you don't actually have to have watched either of those to watch this one - you'll just not be one of us who get confused at the repeated new casting of the kids, Audrey and Rusty). However, for some reason, the film didn't survive my eventual binning of my tapes and buying everything again on DVD. Therefore, I was delighted when a popular online streaming service put it on their schedule in time for the festive season.It was only now did I realise how much I must have watched it back when I was young, as I knew the script practically word for word. So, in short, I still loved it and was in nostalgia heaven. And I could almost leave the review there if it wasn't for the fact that I was watching it now with my girlfriend who had never seen it before in her life. She hated it.Therefore, I was sort of forced to re-evaluate it and, although I maintain my love for it, try to see what some people may find wrong with it. Yes, the jokes are dumb. It's sort of like the 'American Pie' of its generation. It's definitely not high-brown entertainment and you have to accept that you're going to be watching a buffoon at work when it comes to the central character, played by Chevy Chase, Clark Griswold. I guess it could be said that some people may simply find him too annoying and stupid to root for.I suppose a few of the gags do fall a little flat and just as many are predictable, but then by now most adults will have seen so many comedy films by now that they can see 'old humour' coming a mile off. There was actually more profanity in this than I remember, including one 'F-bomb' which does mean that the film may be more unsuitable for 'all' the family than I remember.I suppose it's quite tame and, because of its age, has a feeling of being done before. However, I still maintain that, overall, it's stood the test of time reasonably well and should still pick up a few new fans here and there (especially in terms of good/funny Christmas movies). You'll definitely get more out of it if, like me, you have nostalgia on your side, but even my girlfriend had to admit that Randy Quaid was a joy to watch. Although, she still maintained that the (seldom-used) neighbours got all of the best gags!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1291,46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Best Vaction/Christmas Movie,10/10,14 November 2000,"Poor Clark Griswold, no matter how optimistic he is, his family vacations always seem to go severely wrong. First time around he went across America in a metallic pea Station Wagon and it ended in disaster. Then they went across Europe and met similar, albeit much less funny, results.For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Griswolds, Clark is food additives expert who works for a company that doesn't appreciate him. He sets high standards for holiday events that no one can live up to and is notorious for dragging his grudging family along on every painstaking detail of every scheme. His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is the voice of reason, who keeps the family rooted in reality and responds with frequent deadpan bewilderment to his constant disasters. The long-suffering kids, Russ and Audrey (Johnny Galecki and a very young Juliette Lewis) have turned into the living embodiment of pure cynicism, but there's no talking any sense into Clark Griswold. Ever! But now Clark just wants to stay at home in the snowy Chicago suburbs for a 'fun, old-fashioned, family Christmas' and he's going to let nothing stop him. His enthusiasm for the holidays manages to infect the audience and you'll be rooting for him the whole way. He's an anti-Scrooge and if you're having a Christmas crisis then you need to watch this movie. Any disasters can be overcome.But that's easier said than done. He didn't bargain on bickering family members (including the voice of Betty Boop, Mae Questel, as a senile old aunt), a house covered in non-working Christmas lights, a seriously over-cooked turkey, snotty Yuppie neighbors making fun of him or Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his hickabilly family turning up unannounced to sponge some Christmas cheer off him.What stops it from being just another generic Christmas movie is a brilliant script by John Hughes packed full of hilarious set-pieces and perfect comic timing from Chevy Chase. He's a great actor but his appeal sadly declined in the 90s when he refused to evolve into more serious roles like Bill Murray did. Clark Griswold and Fletch are probably his most famous roles and this Vacation is definitely one you need to take.It's hard to pick the best moments but Randy Quaid's sudden appearance will make you grin a mile wide, a cat wrapped up in a box (with Happy Birthday paper!) that meets an unfortunate end and 'an asshole in his bathrobe emptying a chemical toilet into the sewer' are just plain brilliant. But what gives Christmas Vacation something more that makes it so much more special that all the other Christmas movies is that wonderful theme song! It's absolutely brilliant! But that ain't the only great tune the film as to offer. There are also some classic songs by Ray Charles, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry.Although not the best of the bunch (Harold Ramis' direction had an evil edge to the first film that made it just that little bit better), this film has become a Yuletide classic and must be watched every year. Since Christmas is full of annual traditions this film is definitely one you should add to the list. It would criminal to give it anything less that the highly coveted 10/10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1292,47,ironhorse_iv,National Lampoon: Christmas Vacation will give you the hap-hap-happies Christmas ever! Great watch!,8/10,29 December 2014,"Where do you think you're going? Nobody's leaving. Nobody's walking out on this fun, old-fashioned family Christmas. No, no. We're all in this together. This is a full-blown, four-alarm holiday emergency here. We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f*cking Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse. We're going to have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas ever! It's that time of year again! You can't celebrate Christmas without watching National Lampoon Christmas Vacation, first! Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. It is the third installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by John Hughes, based on his short story in National Lampoon magazine, ""Christmas '59"". This movie is notable for being the only one of the Vacation series to take place at the Griswold home which gives the vacation concept, something new. Some people think as this movie as a reboot than a sequel. The film tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) whom is trying to create the best Christmas for his family, but everything, he wants to happen, go against his favor. Can Clark Griswold make the best Christmas holiday for his family or will it turn out to be another disaster? Watch it, to find out. Without spoiling the film, too much. The movie is a great watch. Most of the humors hit the funny bone than miss to me. I love the animated opening credits with the Christmas vacation theme. Apparently even Santa Claus isn't immune to the comic misfortune. I love the slapstick humor has for Clark. Clark trying to set up Christmas lightings is probably the highlight of the film. The movie was very smart in its recycle on old jokes like the Easter eggs, Wally World Cups. Still, other old clichés felt a little overused by other films at the time such as the dog humping scene. Even, Mele Kalikimaka pool sequence was kinda overused. It remind me, of the pool sequence from 1982's Fast Time at Ridgemont High. It wasn't really funny. The fan service, Mary's (Nicolette Scorsese) scenes are hot, but it could be taken out, in my opinion as it has nothing to bring to the table. She's no Christie Brinkley. Some people might not like the dark crude raunchy humor, the movie brings. After all, it does have a cat getting killed on screen and an elderly man getting catch on fire. This movie might not be for everybody. If you got small children, this movie might not be for them with all the sex, violence and harsh language themes. A parent should judge for themselves, if this movie is alright for their children. For the most part, it felt like a PG-13. The movie is well acted. The original cast is just as good as they were in the original previous movie. Chevy Chase is awesome as the everyman father, who just wanted to give the best Christmas ever to his family, but has to fight so much to do it. In my opinion, this is Chevy Chase's greatest film. Supporting characters like Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), were alright for the most part, despite her, being the submissive of sorts, type of wife. The children, Aubrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) were kinda forgettable as they are given little to no screen time. It's seem like in every Vacation movie, new actors are always playing the Griswold's children. It can be a bit confusing as Rusty and Audrey's age differ from film to film. In this film, Audrey tends to be older, despite Rusty being older in the previous two films. Anyways, the previous Griswold's children actors really didn't do much, after their film. At less, these actors went on to become bigger names in the industry. One of the most entertaining part of the film, had to come with Randy Quaid's character of Cousin Eddie who comes back from the original film to plays the opposite of Chevy Chase's straight man character as the scene-stealing slob. He wasn't too annoying or unlikeable. Quaid did the right amount of balance. Other people worth noting is Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the yippie neighbor, Margo Chester, whom always get accident abuse from the Griswold. She was funny. The movie has way too much elder characters to remember. Those could be cut down, or written better. The only ones, I can remember are Francis (Doris Roberts), Bethany (Mae Questel), Lewis (William Hickey) and Art (E.G. Marshall). All of them add their own bits of amusement. Overall: Having seen the previous two films in the Lampoon series. 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation & 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation. I was delighted, this film was really enjoyable. In my opinion, it's the best comedy in the National Lampoon series as a whole. It was not a disappointment, like the sequel, 2003's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 1997's National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation. Since its release in 1989, Christmas Vacation has often been labeled as a modern Christmas classic. This film should definitely raise your spirits and give thanks that your Christmas isn't as stressful as the Griswold.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

I had expectations for high humor coming into the viewing, but was left with the bad taste of a series starting to turn stale.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) hosting ""the relatives"" for Christmas. This obviously includes Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and Co. as well. Per the typical formula, everything goes to hell-in-a-hand-basket despite the best intents of Clark.While the first two Vacation-series movies seem fresh and genuinely funny, ""Christmas Vacation"" seems stale and overbearing (like all the comedy jokes/situations are ""reaches""). Sure, there are some legitimately laugh-out-loud moments in the film, but mostly it falls pretty flat.The main reason for the disappointing effort here is the casting changes. Lewis and Galecki, while both proved afterwards to be pretty fair actors in their own right, are terrible for the roles of Audrey/Rusty (key characters that provide so much of the humor in the earlier films). Maybe it was just the fact that the ""original"" Russ/Audrey can never quite be topped.Thus, while I was hoping for great things from this experience, I can say now that I won't be watching it next Xmas season (or maybe any further out, either). It just fails to capture that quirky sense of humor that its predecessors nailed so succinctly.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1295,50,johnnyboyz,The film almost succeeds as a non-comedy; but childish humour and all too familiar caricatures hold it back.,6/10,27 December 2007,"Best Christmas film ever or not, Christmas Vacation does manage to hit some high notes on the odd rare occasion but never elevates itself above any sort of good to great ground but then again, it never really set out to. Christmas Vacation is a film that deals with many a Christmas issues and binds them all together in a reasonably satisfying way even if it feels heavy handed and somewhat juvenile at certain times.At its core, Christmas Vacation is a film that challenges the American idea, or perhaps the Western idea, of what Christmas is. There is nothing religious in this film and if there is any mention of Jesus Christ, the real reason there is a Christmas, then I must've missed it. Clark Griswold (Chase) is an American who has a family; a well paid job and a 'prefect' detached suburban house with a picket fence and a people carrier. For him and his family (who are a little less than perfect) Christmas is everything: he is expected (as the man of the house who puts the turkey on the table) to risk life and limb in order to staple lights to the roof; he is expected to be able to host a huge Christmas day and he is expected to out class the neighbours when it comes to front yard decorations amongst other things.Bizarrely enough, the funniest parts of Christmas Vacation come in the form of its scenes involving animals. When the cat chews the lights under the chair and gets a shock, I laughed likewise when a squirrel gets loose in the house, the initial sighting of the animal is when the joke's at its funniest but this seems to be a concept that had worn thin by the time Schwarzenegger was chased by a Reindeer around his neighbour's house in Jingle All the Way. Christmas Vacation as a film tests that theory that family is the most important thing at Christmas because, when you pick the film apart, the over crowded house full of finicky family members at Christmas is the films overall pitch. Take away the rest of the family and the nasty hillbilly stereotypes that turn up in the form of Eddie (Quaid) and you don't have a film, you have a 'How to have a perfect Western Christmas' demonstration. It's also a shame that pure idiocy spawns most of Christmas Vacation's jokes. Clark sees fit to staple the lights to his house (how will he get them off afterwards?) in an attempt to go to extremes for his family and a mere week long holiday but doesn't take due care and attention. He also attempts to light up the lights in a big unveiling to the whole family but idiotically, doesn't check them beforehand. Again, Clark is willing to go to such a length that he doesn't even want to spoil the surprise of the lights for himself so that he can share the first experience with his entire household. Either that or he's a complete idiot for not checking the plugs.Christmas Vacation isn't pure farce but it isn't too far off. This is one of the film's plus points in the sense it remains sober in its attempt to portray humour which is clearly aimed at children for 80% of the time. Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush was in a home of some sort with snow and cold on the outside trying to survive the whole ordeal with two others; Clark is this in a sense. But the similarities continue in the sense of slapstick with Chritsmas Vacation containing some iffy humour in the form of flatulence and downright stupidity which are embedded into this film whereas The Gold Rush used slapstick and genuinely funny situations; probably due to the fact it wasn't aimed at children: Christmas Vacation smashed neighbour's windows; Clark kicks his model reindeer's away as he lashes out at what suburban society demands you have on your lawn; there is a lot of running around once a squirrel gets loose and an insane event which acts as reason to get a SWAT team around. These incidences may humour and entertain children but for the rest of us: come on, are we really finding this funny? The only thing I could really tag onto and smirk at throughout is the way Chevy Chase portrays Clark. His deadpan and downer performance of a man seemingly on the edge of not only his family but his work and his Westernised holiday is a good example of a performance carrying a film. For everyone else, Ellen (D'Angelo) is the submissive of sorts wife; the children are not developed beyond anything they need to be and the rest of the family fill in the blanks with good grounds for argument that there are too many of them. Eddie Johnson's character, like I said, and his family are really bad examples of exploiting a certain race/class/gender/sexuality (delete as appropriate) in a negative and demeaning light; something I'd expect a Disney film to do subconsciously.But then again, the film is cheery and fun in a way. It starts off in a way that is akin to a 'Naked Gun' film and I liked two out of those three films and despite loosing ground on quality at various stages, Christmas Vacation deals with deeper subject matter such as trying to host the perfect American family Christmas and how far one should go to achieve these things. The humour may be lagging behind its pacing and variation of jokes but the film has a charm that, let's face it; is only there thanks to Chase's portrayal of the 'man stuck in a no win situation' character; much like Keaton and much like Chaplin.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1296,51,leplatypus,Not Enough Gifts (DVD) (vhs),7/10,30 July 2007,"If it will be always a pleasure to see (and again) the Griswold movies, this last adventure is the less enjoyable: Sure, you got the family rituals driven husband & father, the pragmatic wife and the disillusioned kids, the crazy, irritating relatives, all mixed with the Christmas Spirit, but the result is not up to the previous ones.Yes, it is difficult to direct Christmas because it is essentially a living-room drama, but actually, the flaw of this episode is rather the lack of interaction between characters: it is essentially a one-man show of Chevy Chase: Chevy with the gifts, Chevy with the lights, Chevy on a ledge, Chevy with this, Chevy with that.So, it is funny but it lacks spiritual cement!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1298,53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Predictable Christmas hi-jinx that you still have to enjoy,7/10,14 January 2009,"Normally when you can see a film's jokes coming from a mile away, it tends to take the film down a notch in most people's eyes, but in ""Christmas Vacation,"" the third Vacation film from John Hughes and the National Lampoon's crew, it still finds away of charming your pants off--or on fire.This time the Griswolds in fact are not vacationing, but invite their extended family to spend the week up until Christmas. This time, everything goes awry at their place. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Clark (Chase) goes overboard with the Christmas lights to find they don't work and manages to have assorted objects smack him in the face or take him out completely on numerous occasions. The grandparents are completely off their rockers and the kids can't stand it. Then of course what would a family Christmas be without their hick cousins the Johnsons, especially their father figure, Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is more reckless and stupid than ever in effort to push Clark over the brink.80s comedy mastermind Hughes (""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" the other 2 vacation movies) pretty much decided to stuff everything he included in the tons of other comedies he wrote in the decade into this film. It has everything from extreme physical comedy to wacky relatives to animals causing mayhem. That's why it's so predictable, but of course Hughes is also the master of reminding us of our family values and keeping them close (easy enough in a Christmas film). The comedy starts out rusty but once the ball gets rolling ""Christmas Vacation"" gets harder to roll your eyes at. The subtle outlandish humor and hi-jinx win you over every time.Chevy Chase remains the glue of the Vacation films. Every man feels like Clark Griswold at times (trouble at work, extra-marital temptations, putting all their effort into something to fail or be under-appreciated) and every person has or knows a dad like Clark Griswold. He's the epitome of the Hallmark greeting card ""Dad."" Without his ho-hum but quick to heat up personality that Chase nails down, these films wouldn't be as good; it would be harder to get past the predictable slapstick.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1299,54,southdavid,Brace your elf.,4/10,26 November 2020,"Get your downvotes ready people, because I don't like this one.With Amazon Prime now cycling on from Halloween Horror films towards Christmas, the irrational rules I set up to decide what I watch meant that reluctantly sat through ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" - a film I might have liked when it was released, as I was nine - but now couldn't wait for the witless, tedious, pratfalls to be over.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to have the ultimate family Christmas, like the ones he remembers from his youth. Unfortunately, disaster befalls him at every turn as his Christmas tree is too big, his lights won't turn on and his extended family arrive to argue and snipe at him. He's also reliant on an incoming Christmas bonus from his job, which he's already spent on a Swimming pool.I just don't like slapstick comedy that much and that's all ""Christmas Vacation"" is, there's no wit or jokes - there's nothing intelligent about it. It's just Chevy Chase falling over and his grandfather blowing himself up (I swear he does that the same way three times). This even extends to his neighbours (one of whom is played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus!) who must do the worst scene of 'comical' falling over that I've ever seen in my life.It doesn't help that we now know that both the male leads of the film are terrible people in real life. Nor the scenes when Clark lusts after a shop assistant despite already having a wife that is several times out of his league. Ultimately though, I just didn't find it that funny, I say again, it's just falling over and explosions. I'm not going to suggest for a moment that all these people giving the film a good review are wrong but I just wonder if their history with it is clouding their objectivity.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

While the first was the strongest, this one captures some aspect that makes me love it more. I have no idea what that aspect is, but it works.Clark has invited the whole family for Christmas Vacation and as usual, nothing goes right. With the sudden, unexpected appearance of Cousin Eddie and his whole family (including their beloved dog, ""Snot""), Clark slowly begins to develop a nervous twitch. The lights he has installed all over the entire house do not work, and his family is driving him insane. Short trip.The only real gripe I have with this movie has to do with Rusty and Audrey. It's ""Back to the Future"" meets the Grizwolds! WtF?! WHY is Rusty now SHORTER and YOUNGER than Audrey?!But the zany factor lacking in the last installment, is back with a vengeance. And, while I found the constant transformations of Rusty and Audrey to be annoying, I suppose I've gotten used to it, and come to expect it, as it did not bother me nearly as much this time around.By far, my favorite of this series.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Maybe the best Christmas movie ever.,10/10,20 May 2021,"Christmas Vacation (1989) is a movie we all sat down and watched out of the DVD collection this holiday season. The storyline focuses on the Christmas season when Clark Griswold hosts both sides of the family at his house. His brother also mysteriously drops in and adds to the party. When nothing goes as planned temperatures rise and an explosive climax to the holiday festivities ensues. This movie is directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (Benny & June) and stars Chevy Chase (Spies Like Us), Beverly D'Angelo (American History X), Juliette Lewis (From Dusk till Dawn), Diane Ladd (Wild at Heart), Randy Quaid (King Pin) and Doris Roberts (The Taking of Pelham One Two Three). The comedic content in this are so smart, clever and timeless. You get so many nostalgic feelings every time you watch this. It's one of those movies you've watched so many times you can't remember the first time you saw it. This is well done from beginning to end and is a must have for your DVD collection.

1306,61,drqshadow-reviews,A Nearly Perfect Blend of Darkly-Humored Sentiment and Christmas-Flavored Sarcasm,9/10,28 January 2020,"Each of the early Vacation movies nails a certain aspect of middle class family life, be it the cross-country road trip or a rare overseas adventure, and most of their laughs come from the lack of romanticism or glossy, nostalgic veneer. They dig straight into the dirty reality of awkward family dynamics, the unfulfilled promise of adulthood and the emptiness of the American dream; weighty subjects for a comedy, but the results are never all that serious. This time we're home for the holidays, with a busy household of nosy, noisy, overly dramatic relatives, in from out of town for a long, unpleasant visit. A Lampoon stay-cation, in other words, with a whole mess of awful family obligations.John Hughes is in the writer's chair again, delivering his usual high-quality, relatable laughs with just a hint of sentiment. Clearly, he's lived this life and made these mistakes, and with the benefit of hindsight, he's all too happy to share and enjoy with the rest of us. Chevy Chase runs the show on-screen, his stress levels spiked as the maligned, tormented family man who's always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He's picture perfect as the seemingly-jolly patriarch with a devilish glint in one eye, and his visibly mounting frustrations enhance almost every scene before the inevitable blow-up.Spotted with legendary lines and fantastic scenes, the tale of the Griswolds' latest spectacular misfortune is a rumbling, tumbling wrecking ball of yule-tinted mayhem. A few of the jokes have grown dated (like most of neighboring Julia Louis-Dreyfuss's home décor), but the spirit remains rich and the broad, physical humor is timeless. I know it all by heart and I still laugh until my face hurts.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1307,62,snoozejonc,Fairly strong comedy with Chevy Chase on top form,7/10,1 January 2021,"Clark Griswold plans an old fashioned family Christmas.I enjoyed this one for it's humour and Chevy Chase's hilarious performance.The story is pretty thin but contains a little nod to Dickens' A Christmas Carol with the Griswolds in place of the Cratchits and Brian Doyle-Murray playing a Scrooge-like Frank Shirley. The main focus is Clark's mission to have a big, joyful family Christmas and everything associated with this that goes spectacularly wrong.As a comedy it is reasonably strong and the jokes come thick and fast. From the start we see Clark's visual buffoonery in a plethora of disastrous actions, decisions and situations. There is a fair bit of slapstick and one-liners that worked well for me. Also the family dynamics involving the children, grandparents and other eccentric relatives are easily recognisable.Christmas Vacation is probably best known for Clark's ridiculously over the top exterior light show that he plasters all over the house. These are the strongest scenes in the movie and Chevy Chase has some of his most memorable moments here.Chase's performance for me is superb. He can make me laugh with facial expressions, physical awkwardness and one-liners. It is him and his characters that carry most of his movies and this is no different. Clark is a control freak who has everything planned out and we have the pleasure of seeing him unravel as the plans backfire. He has good support from Beverly D'Angelo and the remaining cast but it all revolves around him. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has some funny moments as one half of a couple of Yuppie neighbours.My only negatives are that it does contain a few too many recycled concepts from the original Vacation movie for my liking, such as 'the girl', the car-jump, animal death, Clarke's meltdown and heart to heart with a child. Also for me, the comedy dips in quality a bit in the second half, particularly with the protracted squirrel sequence and the repetition of fire/explosion related gags.As 'Christmas movies' go it's pretty good. How many have a cultural impact you can actually see when driving around suburban housing estates after dark during the month of December?",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1308,63,smatysia,Hasn't aged well.,5/10,31 May 2011,"I first saw this a long time ago, and liked it a lot. On a recent viewing, I find that it hasn't aged as well as I thought. It was fun to see John Galecki and Juliette Lewis as children, and I had forgotten how pretty Julia Louis-Dreyfus was back then. I got one big laugh-out-loud moment from the whole movie, when the old aunt forgets that she is supposed to say the pre-meal blessing, and starts into the Pledge of Allegiance instead, and the whole family dutifully joins in. Clark Griswold is such a sad sack, and even though I know it is the point of the film, it's still a bit cloying. This is still OK as ""one of the Vacation films"" but if it stood alone, I think it would suffer.

I grew up watching & loving this Vacation film & of Course i love all the fantastic Vacation films & pretty much all of Chevy's flicks some of my faves of the Comedy legend's are FLETCH, FLETCH LIVES, SPIES LIKE US, THE VACATION FILMS, THREE AMIGOS, MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE & COPS & ROBBERSONS, those are the one's i grew up watching & loving.
Chevy has been a huge part of my movie loving world since little & consider him the best movie Dad character ever with his hilarious but also touching role as Clark Griswold, the guy just wants to have the best time with his family & have as much fun as possible, he's an old fashioned all American Family man & i love him for it.
Christmas Vacation is a masterpiece of Comedy it's truly hilarious from it's Awesome animated opening to it's crazy ending it's a fun filled & hilarious crazy Christmas Comedy that never gets old, i still laugh like i did as a kid watching it.
Christmas Vacation is also a really beautiful film as its drenched in the beautiful look of Christmas with lots of snow & lots & lots of lights lol & there's a real sweet innocence fun to everything & at the heart of all the craziness is a nice Family man trying to have a big old fun family Christmas & he loves his family.Chevy is fantastic here as Clark & is probably the best of the Vacation franchise & really shows why he's one of greatest comic leading men in Cinema history.
Chevy is also a real nice family man in real life too & that makes me respect him & appreciate his films even more!!! Big Nostalgic Love for Chevy Chase, i wish Clark Griswold was my dad.

Stemming from Chevy Chase's off kilter personality, into the antics of the rest of the cast, it's a jumble of jokes that don't always land and are somewhat trapped in an 80's humour bubble, but are also frequently hilarious. Chase plays awkward Clark Griswold, overseeing a chaotic holiday celebration at his home with his wife (Beverly D'Angelo) and kids, including a very young Juliette Lewis, as well as his extended clan, headed up by obnoxious, boorish brother Randy Quaid who assists him in his struggles with his selfish boss. It all flies by in a flurry of silliness, with memorable appearances from Sam Mcmurray, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, William Hickey and more. Always a weird and wonderful holiday treat.

Quaid is great as Cousin Eddie, who steals the show, when he is on-screen.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD's only real extra is the decent commentary track by the director, the executive producer:Matty Simmons and cast members:D'Angelo, Quaid, Flynn and Galecki.

First off, I want to praise John Hughes for his screenwriting, cause obviously no one but him could have written this film, and make it work as well as it did. That being said, there are a few problems when it comes to gags and delivery of them throughout the film. It isn't to say the gags aren't funny, it just feels like they could have worked a lot better if given a little more time and thought into how they were delivered, but instead a few of them feel kinda rushed. The look of the film isn't anything too special, but many of the physical gags can be quite fun, and perhaps some of the best moments of the film in general. The music is fun and lively, its cast is often electric, with Chevy Chase providing an excellent comedic performance as always. I also rather enjoyed the performances of the two kid actors in the Griswold family, although it can be a bit annoying that they change up the family dynamic so often with these films. In the end, Christmas Vacation did what it promised to do, and that was make me laugh. It's an entertaining and fun little Christmas flick that may just be the best Vacation film since the original.

1314,69,vertigo_14,"""You couldn't hear a dump truck drive through a nitroglicerine plant."" (spoilers)",9/10,26 November 2004,"Christmas Vacation is essential holiday viewing, should your holiday traditions include watching a slew of good holiday-themed movies. Add to the list one of National Lampoon's most memorable, if not funniest movie, they have ever added the name to.Join Clark Griswold's quest for a good old-fashioned ""Griswold family Christmas,"" in which, once again, despite his wife's warnings, is another attempt to make the more of a holiday than most think he ought to (see previous Griswold adventures in 'Vacation' and 'European Vacation'). And if you are familiar with these movies, you know that lots of things will go wrong before they finally go right. I think, more than the other Griswold vacation movies, this one was immensely helped by a hilarious supporting cast, including Randy Quaid showing off his great comedic talent as redneck Cousin Eddie (who shows up unexpectedly with his wife, drooling dog, and two kids in their camper), William Hickey who plays grumpy Uncle Lewis (from whom my quote is from), deaf but lovable Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel), and Julia Louise-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the arrogant yuppie neighbors who have plenty of hilarious (and disastrous) run-ins with Clark. Think of it as a situation similar to 'Madhouse' (the Kirstie Alley/John Laroquette comedy), but much much funnier. It's a damn good comedy.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1315,70,Sandcooler,"Clark Griswold with a stapler, it can't not be funny",7/10,25 December 2008,"The plot here is pretty non-existent(Christmas, that's pretty much it), but I think it's fairly smart that they decided to make a ""Vacation"" movie where they just stay home. Gags from around the house, pretty easy but it's entertaining. Chevy Chase on a ladder, Chevy Chase with a chainsaw, Chevy Chase with a squirrel, it's really that sort of thing. There's this beautiful simplicity to a tree breaking through a window. And then when those things can't be milked anymore Cousin Eddie gets his time in the spotlight, he's pretty funny I guess. But what I like most about this movie is that it's Christmas for actual people, they don't ham it up. They don't give any forced moral lessons, they don't tell us what Christmas should be all about(well maybe they kinda do, I just didn't mind), they don't even have a Santa cameo if you can believe it. I was quite surprised by that, I thought they'd screw it up near the ending. This is definitely one of the better ""Vacation"" movies, fun throughout.

1316,71,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Funniest Christmas movie ever made,10/10,1 February 2014,"The film has several references to the original National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: opening scene, with the family singing in the car, is similar to an early scene in the original Vacation; their car flying over snowbank is similar to car flying over roadblock in Arizona in Vacation; another befuddled, elderly aunt drops in, but the movie is good enough that it doesn't become a rehash of the first film.It takes its time getting started; the first thirty minutes are hit and miss, but after that, it gets good, and the final thirty minutes are hilarious.Aunt Bethany is introduced with some funny lines (""Is your house on fire?"" she cheerfully asks upon seeing 25.000 Christmas lights on it) but filmmakers wisely avoided a repeat of Aunt Edna from the original, as this confused granny lives happily through the holiday.Speaking of *holiday*, 'Holiday Road' worked well in the original Vacation, was tired and formulaic in Euro Vacation, and was wisely avoided here, and replaced with a wonderful original score.The music, and the overall tone of the entire film, is sentimental without being overly sappy; Clark watching old home movies of his youth has just the right amount of sentiment, then it was ended perfectly with a well done gag.Uncle Lewis is a delightful Grinch, with his strangled voice and deadpan delivery of lines which could have been painfully unfunny complaints, but his delivery and timing makes them work.The kids are great replacements, upgrades, for the two awful, nitwit kids in Euro Vacation.My favourite film in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, and probably my favourite Christmas movie, also.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1319,74,mike48128,One of the Best Christmas Comedies of All Time,9/10,20 December 2013,"Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) strikes again. There are some things I don't like about it, hence only a ""9"". Cuss words. Potty jokes. Like most John Hughes scripts and films, another great outrageous comedy sure to offend someone. So many funny situations: The ""mad"" trucker (like ""Duel""). The Dukes of Hazard-style airborne station wagon. The hunt for the perfect Christmas tree. The playboy centerfold salesgirl. Tacky home movies. The obnoxious relatives and upscale neighbors. The turkey, Christmas tree, and cat. (They all explode or catch fire.) Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and ""Snot"" the dog. The absent-minded Aunt. The in-laws. The wild squirrel in the tree. The horrible boss. The dumb Chicago SWAT team. Santa and his sleigh ""fly"" over the moon when the sewer explodes! Makes great fun of every holiday tradition or movie you have ever seen from ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to ""White Christmas"". Far too funny and clever to just view once a year. An outstanding supporting cast, with pretty Beverly D'Angelo as Clark's long-suffering and faithful wife: ""Honey, let's just go home.

1320,75,FlushingCaps,"Much to like, some things to dislike",9/10,12 December 2020,"As I write this after seeing it again last night, there are 347 reviews of this on IMDB, most of which go through a good description of what happened, so I won't duplicate too much of that. My purpose is to discuss scenes I particularly liked, point out some things that weren't so good, and analyze why I think some people disliked it so much.I will say that it's impossible to truly understand other people's reviews, such as when they write: (taken from actual IMDB reviews) ""I never laughed so hard in my life""-as they give that movie a 7, making me wonder if they never saw a film so good they gave it an 8, 9, or 10. Then there's the person who wrote: ""One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but it's not that great.""? I cannot fathom the thinking there.I somewhat liked Chase's original Vacation flick. Some scenes were quite funny, like when he got rooked on his new auto, or when the thugs stripped his car while cheerily giving him directions, but other scenes were more disturbing than funny-much of the visit with the relatives, including the aunt dying in the car and how they handled that. Overall, I just didn't laugh nearly as much as in Christmas Vacation.There is the matter of foul language. Many writers and comedians these days fail to understand they can be FUNNIER with fewer cuss words, or even none. They seem stuck in the adolescent thinking that it is really funny to hear someone cuss. Not usually.
So I understand that lots of people-young and old-complain about the prevalence of foul language. It would have been better if they had minimized it. The one time, when Clark was ranting on finding out he didn't get his expected Christmas bonus, and he included a cuss word in Danny Kaye's name (referring to a famous Christmas movie) that the word there was appropriate to his frustrated situation and was humorous. Cousin Eddie's use of vulgar words was appropriate for his character, but if he'd been restrained to, let's say two uses of vulgar terms only, the film would have been improved. Now I have seen a few films that had so much foul language I gave them really low scores. This film didn't approach those in the volume of foul language, so it wasn't nearly as much of a negative as the other films.One of the great strengths is the character of Clark. I think someone reviewed this saying that Chevy Chase wasn't a good choice for the role because we know in real life he's far from a good person. I wonder if that person would see a truly horrible film and say they thought it was great, not so much because of the script, but because they know the star is an absolutely wonderful person to his family and his community, and donates all sorts of time and money to worthwhile charities. Sorry, my reviews are based on the film or TV show, not anything I know about any of the actors' personal lives.Clark is totally devoted to being a great husband and father, truly knocking himself out to give them a fabulous Christmas vacation to remember forever. To those who say there was no ""vacation"" here, I will point out that a vacation means time off from work or school. It does not require a trip, as in every school kid in America looking forward to their ""summer vacation."" In this film, the kids during the last few days are ON their Christmas (or Holiday, if you must) VACATION-they aren't going to school. Clark tells his buddy at work a few days before Christmas that it's his last day at work until after New Year's Day, so he is taking a ""Christmas vacation"" too. That's 3 our of 4 in the immediate family that are truly having a Christmas vacation, and you could add in all the relatives who traveled to Chicagoland to visit-the four grandparents stayed several days with the Griswold's so they too are having a vacation that includes a trip.Someone wrote that this film just had recycled gags from the first in this short series. Oh? I don't recall any long scenes or short ones where Clark had trouble with any electrical hookup in the 1983 Vacation. I must have missed the scenes where his actions caused great damage to some nasty people next door to him in his motels. I sure don't remember him flying down a hill on a coaster in any way in that first film. In other words, almost everything in this one was NOT in the original. Probably that reviewer was equating the pretty girl actually flirting with Clark from her sportscar with the salesgirl innocently trying to make a sale while the embarrassed Clark fumbled over his words because she was basically exposing her breasts to him in the department store. Quite different nature to those scenes and in the latter film it was much funnier.I didn't enjoy those parts in the original because of several things connected to the pretty girl. First, pulling up and flirting while driving by is a serious traffic hazard-someone could have been distracted and killed. Second, I couldn't get why a beautiful girl in her 20s would pull up next to a man in a station wagon so clearly traveling with his wife and two kids, and begin to flirt with him. Even more so, why would a happily-married man do more than glance at the pretty girl with his wife right beside him? The believability quotient is at zero that this girl would, on different days, keep driving by the same wagon if she wasn't stalking him. Then she actually stayed at the same motel they did and seriously invited him out to swim in the outdoor motel pool with her, in the nude? That Clark would give in and go out with her does not fit the image of a man who loves his wife, or who uses his brain which should have told him he will almost surely be caught.In the Christmas film, the girl at the counter does nothing after her one encounter with Clark, where all she tried to do was make a sale. Her appearance at Clark's not-yet-built pool was only a fantasy where Clark looked out his window and fantasized about his pool and Cousin Eddie and others all being in or around it, then suddenly he started thinking about that salesgirl. He didn't actually DO anything to be with her.My least-favorite scene was when the cat was chewing on the wires for the Christmas tree lights and unplugged them, then went off camera. When Clark noticed the light were out, he found they were unplugged and on re-plugging them in, caused a distressed cat noise and we then saw a black mark on the floor with a little cat fur, letting us figure out the cat not only got electrocuted, but was virtually incinerated. It would have been far funnier to make it a more comical cat-got-singed incident but was OK after, sort of like Christmas with the Kranks where Luther sprayed the cat with the garden hose, causing it to become frozen in a block of ice, temporarily, with the cat being just fine once it thawed out. Accident or not, it just isn't funny to see someone's beloved pet get killed. If I were to copy this I would like to edit out the cat killing scene.Someone else complained about the casting changes for the Griswold children. Well, how do you have those actors who were teens in 1983 still look like young teens in a film made 6 years later. The kids who played them in Vacation were 17 and 15 then; would you want them to be 23 and 21 in this one?Someone else wrote that aside from Clark and Ellen, none of the other characters were likeable. I thought Audrey was great in her steady support for her father as he failed at getting the Christmas lights to come on. Rusty didn't whine and complain, but simply tried to help his dad whenever he was asked to. The kids' grandparents were rather likeable too, mostly. And how could you not like little Ruby Sue asking her uncle if he was Santa Clause? I like Clark's dad quietly giving him a pep talk about his screw up and how it was OK because we all make mistakes. He said some really nice things to Clark after Clark's big tirade.I thought Ellen was very nice to her husband, exasperated with him for the dumb things he did, but merely supporting him and trying to help him, instead of yelling at him about how he is making things worse. The scene where Clark got locked in the attic and knew the family wouldn't return from shopping for a long time, so he made the best of it, finding old home movies from his childhood and setting up a projector and enjoying the great memories was not only touching, but served to help us understand why he wanted so much to make a great Christmas for his family to remember. They showed it, but didn't have a scene preaching about it.When Clark learned that Eddie's financial fortunes were nil, he went out of his way to tell Eddie that he and Ellen wanted to help them make for a good Christmas for their kids by helping out buying some presents. He asked nothing of Eddie, just did so because they were family. That was another nice scene, played out with some humor as Eddie was loading a shopping cart with 100 pounds of dog food for Snots-all for Clark to buy. But overall, it was a nice touching scene.Some of the funny things were bits that weren't explained. Such as the opening scene where this suburban Chicago family apparently drove 1000 miles to an area with massive mountains to find a Christmas tree. Then they get out of their car and hike what looked to be no less than half a mile before spotting the perfect tree-never mind the fact that it's about 18 feet tall and so wide it would fill the living room wall to wall. Only when they look at the tree does anyone think about how useful it would be to have brought an ax or a saw.We next see this huge tree-roots and all, all tied up with rope-that also wasn't brought-atop the car as they drive home. Of course, they couldn't have dug this big tree up out of the frozen ground without some tools, but that's what made that part funny.There were tons of great sight gags, leading to my ranking of 9.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Well, this one is one of the first Christmas movies I've seen that is hilarious without the overuse of crude humor and it's still just as good now as it would have been in 1989. There is the occasional crude humor joke, but those can be overlooked. Most of the movie's comedy comes from the strange misfortunes of the Griswold family, from a squirrel attack to being trapped in the attic to having Clark (the father)'s redneck cousin Eddie and his inbred family show up in a trailer parked on the front lawn. The cast was an excellent choice and the soundtrack is funny but not annoying.

This time around, the Griswolds are spending Christmas at there house, where all of their deranged family members come to visit. Clark has started to hit on a jewelry store woman.

1323,78,gizmomogwai,"Christmas is never perfect, but we like it anyway",8/10,5 December 2010,"The original National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) is one of my favourite comedies, and has been since I was a kid. I was also familiar with and loved this third Christmas-themed movie. Here we have the Griswolds again, minus the road trip and the catchy Holiday Road theme song.Now, looking back at these movies, I can say Vacation is definitely better than Christmas Vacation. Vacation has some smarter humour and some of Christmas Vacation's jokes are recycled from the original- the car flying, Clark going on a cursing streak, the family kidnapping someone. (Last time it was John Candy, now it's Brian Doyle Murray. Ellen says it's her family's first kidnapping, which is a blatant lie.)Although the sequel borrows too much from Vacation at times, at other times I wish it had taken after it more. Rusty and Audrey look little like they did before. Audrey is too skinny and too blonde; Rusty is too short and wide, and he looks about ten. Jane Krakowski is absent, despite her classic appearance in the original as Vicki (Vicki does come back in the mostly unfunny Vegas Vacation, but with a new actress). Also missing- the nudity. Both Vacation and European Vacation had breasts.That said, there's some good material here. The jokes which make this movie worth seeing include a comically poorly chosen tree, a sign of Clark's foolish nature. The wrapped up cat is funny, and its demise is the only time an animal death in these movies was actually funny. (I've never owned a cat, and as a kid I loved the expression ""fried pussy cat."") The botched grace at dinner is funny. Clark flipping out with a chainsaw and his staircase is funny. This may not be great, but like European Vacation it's definitely watchable. 7.5/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

1327,82,jhclues,The Perfect Holiday Comedy,10/10,15 August 2000,"The Griswold family is set to celebrate the holidays like never before, in `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,' directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes.  Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or he's `in it up to here').  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to the mountains to find the perfect `Griswold family Christmas tree.  And it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun. 	Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up unexpectedly in the `RV' they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark expected, or wanted, to see.  `Eddie,' he tells him, `I couldn't be more surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.'  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases try to elude) the deadly invader. 	A terrific cast was assembled for this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through your own `special' holiday season.  I rate this one 10/10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1328,83,rupie,a seasonal classic in our house,7/10,24 December 1999,"Okay, so the humor is rather broad and unsubtle, and there's a deal of slapstick as well as some crudeness, but somehow I have a real affection for this portrayal of how the earnest, ever-well-meaning Clark Griswold's plans for the Perfect Griswold Family Christmas slowly, inexorably mutate into the Christmas from Hell. There are simply too many wonderful moments of humor to discard the flick: the little wheezing sound the turkey makes as it disintegrates, the outline of the cat burned into the carpet, panic in the power plant as Clark's lights kick in, the arrival of Eddy & family, etc. etc. Reliable holiday humor, that reminds us in too many ways of many of our own Christmas gatherings of the clans. Far superior to Holly Hunter's botched treatment of the same idea in ""Home for the Holidays.""

1331,86,Hollywood_Yoda,The Best Vacation,8/10,4 November 2018,"Ironically, the Griswolds don't go on vacation in this installment, but rather stay home for the holidays. Clark's antics still play a major role too, as he clashes with his family and the neighbors. The neighbors, Todd and Margo are played by Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Also in Christmas Vacation, we get to meet the parents of both Clark and Ellen.Again, as in the other Vacation films, the Griswold children are played by different actors, this time Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis. They are among the more famous names to play the Griswold kids. Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond fame plays Ellen's mother. And the holiday wouldn't be more fun without Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany. Bethany, played by Mae Questel, the voice of Betty Boop!The most fun you'll have on vacation I'd staying home!

Yep, its the seminal classic from 1989 which proves than the more you try during the holiday, the more you screw things up. Just do what I do, and let others take the slack. If stuff goes pear-shaped, it's THEIR problem... You're just an innocent bystander.Amongst all the chaos, there's some nugget that no matter how miserable your Xmas is... As long as your family is around you, that's all that matters. Yes, but what if your 'loved ones' are the cause of your strife in the first place? Betcha didn't figure that one out, dude. Why else would you dress up like a goon, spend hours on rooftops in the snow and waste all your money on silly trinkets, if not for them. Hmm... the more I think about it, this movie is perhaps having the OPPOSITE effect on me from what was intended. Now if you don't mind, I'm off to book my desert island for next year. Merry Christmas. :) 6/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Whereas the first film started it all, it was only above average, and the second one just plain stunk. With this 3rd one, you get to see why Chevy Chase and his fellow actors really work well together as the Griswold family (including the extended members such as Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie). The script is strong in this Vacation and the dialogue really works well when the actors say it. You're bound to laugh throughout and it truly is a great Christmas movie to watch (which is fitting because I am writing this review on Christmas day!).

The guests are coming and it's about to Clark (Chevy Chase) to make everything perfect. With his lack of luck it won't be easySome people were disappointed with the second movie in the series – ""European vacation"". They didn't expected much from this third part , because really how much good third movies is out there ? ""Christmas vacation"" turned out to be a really pleasant surprise. Its not only a good movie , but according to many (including me) the best in the series. I like first one , the second is bad , the forth is a disaster , but this one is great. For me it's one of Chase's best movies and one of best Christmas movies . It's a quite huge success , because most of Christmas movies is unwatchable plastic. Jeremiah Chechik is the director of this one. The kids have been re-cast again . This time Juliette Lewis is Audrey and Johnny Galecki is Rusty . I have to say that I really liked Lewis as the typical angry teenage and Johnny Galecki (Lenard from ""The Big bang theory"") as Rusty. There are also new actors and actresses who play Clark's parents and Ellen's parents and his rich neighbors. They give a decent support.Most of the jokes comes from Clark (Chevy Chase) , Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and  cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) ! Yes , he's back with his family and it's he's tour de force . He almost steals the show from Chase . The funniest moments are for me : the cartoon intro , almost every scene with Eddie , Clark talking to the sexy salesman , Clark struggling with the lamps and the Friday 13th reference. Oh , and I love the Tasmanian devil cup that Clark has at his office. And the song ""Christmas vacation"" by Mavis Staples is pretty great.The best movie of Chevy Chase.

Corny, yes, especially upon first viewing; but the gags remain fresh after several years, making this film a staple during Christmas.

1338,0,SnoopyStyle,cute enough,6/10,18 November 2021,"Emily Elizabeth (Darby Camp) is a poor girl living with her mother in New York City. She gets bullied by a rich mean girl at her prestigious private school. Her mother is off on a business trip and she is left in the care of her irresponsible uncle Casey (Jack Whitehall). They visit a pet rescue fair run by the mysterious Bridwell (John Cleese). Emily brings back a little red puppy despite rules against it. With her wish and her love, the puppy grows to be a giant which attracts the attention of biotech mogul Tieran (Tony Hale) who wants the dog for his experiments.This reminds me of a 90's family movies. The CG dog is a little wonky. I don't know why the little puppy has to be CG. Couldn't they get a dog that looks like Clifford and dye him red? I would get an actual comedian to play Casey, someone like a Jack Black. His character is more annoying than funny. Tony Hale is playing a cartoon villain. The mother is British for some unknown reason when her brother doesn't seem to be. All of that fits a bad family film. On the other hand, the girl is adorable and the dog is fun. I can see this as a continuing franchise with the girl growing up into her teens. The story is just cute enough to be good enough.",Clifford the Big Red Dog
1339,1,paul_haakonsen,Rather enjoyable family movie...,6/10,10 November 2021,"Neither me nor my son were familiar with the animated series with the big red dog, so we sat down to watch the 2021 family movie ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"" without having a clue what we were in for, aside from it being a movie with an oversized red puppy.I will say that writers Jay Scherick, David Ronn, Blaise Hemingway, Justin Malen and Ellen Rapoport definitely managed to put together a wholesome and entertaining movie for the entire family, because there was something to enjoy here for all members of the audience, regardless of age.The storyline told in ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"" was rather enjoyable and actually proved entertaining from begininng to end, so thumbs up to the writers for that accomplishment, and also to director Walt Becker for bringing the script to life on the screen in a good way.It should be said that the effects in the movie were good, and the oversized red puppy definitely came off as being realistic and believable, not to mention very adorable and loveable, as puppies usually are. So the CGI team that worked on ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"" certainly worked their magic in bringing the great red puppy to life on the screen.Of course realism and such is out the window here, but then again, it is not something you take into the equation when you sit down and watch a movie such as ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"".The movie also has a good ensemble of casted performers on the cast list, with the likes of Darby Camp, Jack Whitehall, David Alan Grier and John Cleese.If you enjoy family movies, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"", as it was rather enjoyable.My rating of ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"" lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

1341,3,subxerogravity,"Great formulated story, but I was almost taken out of it by so so effects.",7/10,15 November 2021,"I'm aware of the books but not familiar with them.One thing that I thought was odd is not once did I get the feeling that they actually used a real dog for this picture. I don't know if making the dog CGI red possibly effected how real it looked to my eye but I thought it was strange that not at one point did Clifford look real when obviously they had no problem using a real dog.They got a cute kid to head up the movie. Although sometimes it felt she was not interacting with the fake dog all that well (and kids are supposed to be good at that, right?). This could be the fault of the visual effects. Then again, there was some great stunt work with the CGI dog that contradicts that.So, the CGI is a very big part of making this dog come to life and yet it's so so. That's not good.The iffy visuals almost overshadowed an All-star cast (Well All-Star to me). It was a pro to me to go see the film. The online poster stated Rosie Perez was one of the stars of the movie, and I was like cool, but her role was only in one scene and was not even big enough to get into the credits sequence at the end of the movie. That's ok cause Clifford had many other D Listers like Kemon Thompson, Tony Hale, John Cleese and a couple of other actors you may have seen on Saturday Night Live.Heartwarming Story almost makes you forget they the CGI lacks in some cases, but it really does affect the movie.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

It is also a family friendly feature that the whole family can enjoy. Darby plays a 12 year old girl that is bullied at school because she doesn't fit in with the other kids-most of them are rich and she is not. Her mother goes out of town on business so her uncle Jack is in charge but he is not the best role model. He is sloppy, lazy, forgetful, and lives in a truck. Jack is taking Darby to school when they cross paths with John, who has a tent set up with rescue animals. That is where they meet Clifford and Darby falls in love with him. Clifford is a small red puppy but overnight, he grows-it is explained how-into a 10 foot tall puppy and when Tony sees him on tv, he wants him. Tony has a genetics company that is trying to grow things bigger to help feed the world-and get richer-but has been unsuccessful so far, so he thinks Clifford is the answer to his prayers. There are lots of funny antics and situations to entertain everyone, plus a moral lesson about acceptance. There are a couple of comedians in cameos; I remember seeing David Alan Grier, Paul Rodriguez and Kenan Thompson.It's rated ""PG"" for mild action and impolite humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-maybe for my grandkids-but it would be a good rental.",Clifford the Big Red Dog
1344,6,aidanratesmovies,Actually not half bad,6/10,13 November 2021,"Far more enjoyable than I expected it to be, although not anything to cry home about, Clifford the Big Red Dog gets its job done doing what it needs to do. I'll start with the films cons- mainly being the many jokes that don't work and its incredibly generic villain. Yeah its expected to have some corny jokes and some that don't simply work in a movie like this, but its just disappointing to see how in the midst of trying so hard on this film, they still don't realize how it drags the film down in quality. And yeah, the villain is about as forgettable as they come- and honestly a very odd choice. I enjoy Tony Hale as much as the next guy, but he just doesn't work as a villain- let alone someone who is trying to accomplish world hunger, but I guess he just cares about money- but its still such an odd odd choice both casting and writing wise. The film is moderately entertaining throughout and has a very sweet charm to it, even made me tear up a couple of times. Its an incredibly sweet film about friendship and family, and its central message is very well executed in the end. It's not as big as its titular character, but in the end, Clifford the Big Red Dog isn't half bad for an adaptation of a childrens book from nearly 60 years ago. Lets just hope they don't make it into a franchise.My Rating: 5.6/10.",Clifford the Big Red Dog
1345,7,rgkarim,A Dog Gone Cute Film,7/10,12 November 2021,"LIKES:The Pace: The books are not the deepest bits of lore, always meant to capture attention with the colorful illustrations and superficial fun. This live adaptation manages to keep that fun going, using the imagery to entertain, while also allowing time to enjoy the simplistic story set before it. There is little dawdling and identity politics in this movie, and instead just trying to give you an adventure with a unique dog and his loving owner. Kids will love the fast paced nature of the film, and parents should be happy that they get out of the movie a bit faster than your typical film. However, it should be noted that the movie also gives time to appreciate aspects of the film, at least to the children's book level quality.The Story:
Clifford's story is certainly simple and fun, and like many movies of the modern era, instilled to teach the younger generation. A few important life lessons are illustrated in the movie and preaching the message we got hit with during the election. Charming, well versed, and presented in a straightforward manner, Clifford's human cast is ready to raise awareness to these issues. Yet, the biggest part of the story I loved was just the core tale of the girl and her love for the dog, and that heartwarming element makes you feel good, assuming you can get past the preachiness of it.The Comedy, to an extent:
Clifford is a kids oriented film, and that means the comedy is following that suit as well. For kids, the antics are most likely going to result in the theater or room erupting in laughter, while for parents there are going to be spare moments of actual laughs. Yet, there are times where the forced line, timing, and the joke itself are funny and will appeal to the more mature palette. The child like nature in my heart also got some laughs out as well and I absolutely felt a third of the movie I chuckled in.The Cute Factor:
It's a family fun film, with the level a 1 or 2 at most for being too much viewers. Clifford's safe waters amplify and rely on you being drawn in by the cute factor, and do not shy away from feeling like the book's they are based on. Puppy antics are the heart of the cuteness, but there are some other things that deserve a nod from me in this film. The neighborhood factor is charming and adorable, giving vibes of Sesame Street that help establish that extended family friends. Emily's relationship with a few of her friends also is wrapped up in a nice little bow, and holds a relevant factor to me, which once again amplifies the awe factor I held for it. Again, it's family friendly aspect that are enjoyable, and I absolutely think this will be a high factor for the intended audience.The Animation/Dog:
The star of the show is actually the one who is not alive, the CGI dog that is Clifford. While he is not the goofy, big eyed dog made famous in the books, the Labrador look suits him well and the puppy element kept in theme with the dog. I fell in love with the design of the puppy, and impressed with the details that they manage to add in this movie. His animation was smooth, the physiology executed perfectly, adding those touches of whines, moans, and barks that the canine animal kingdom thrives in. And yet, they also added a human quality that pets seem to have, helping to give Clifford more character to fall in love with. He was utilized well, for both storytelling and comedy, and the commercialism of him delivered 110% for this reviewer. Kids will fall in love with the titular character, and hopefully the older group will appreciate the work that went into him.DISLIKES:Predictable:
While the story is in line the books, it does not mean we needed to be devoid of a little extra flare factor in the movie. Clifford's adventure holds little surprise, and you can discern the story in about twenty minutes from the start. I did not need anything dark or super complicated, but I think we can all agree that adding some layers could have elevated the audience range a little more.The Antagonist
Kids movies have shown great villains in the form of Scar, Xibalba, even Maleficent. Clifford did not give us that award winning bad guy, instead generic poser who did little but overact and talk like a snide business man. The weaker antagonist made for impasses and obstacles that could have again livened up the movie. It led again to scenes lacking suspense, and a very G rated experience that did little for the older audience member like myself. Again, kids should be okay, but trending towards the preteen era, may see diminishing returns compared to other classic kids movies and makes it a little boring unfortunately.The Acting:
I get it, this is not meant to be the Academies, but more effort could have been used to up the game a little bit. Clifford's group is certainly not the worst acting bunch, but there is much to be desired in the young cast that I hope to see evolve in future works. The lead role has moments that are touching and really show the potential, while other times are forced acting that fall back into uncomfortable direction that I don't think they intended. The second child star was okay, and he hits points that will have younger audience members cackling in glee. Yet, the direction of the character is a bit haphazard, uneven, and inconsistent that needed some toning down to be the character I think they wanted. As for the adults, they do some things very well, but again most of them are very one dimensional, super annoying at times, and so forced on comedy that again you need to have the kid state of mind to fully appreciate it. John Cleese is the exception to the rule, and he delivers his wacky, wizard role to fine perfection and balance that I had wished we had more of him.The Stunts/Action:
Highly geared towards kids, the adventure/exciting parts are cute, and there are times that it certainly delivers maximum impact on the dream of having a giant puppy. However, there are other times where the stunts are super silly, vaudeville like moments that are about being clumsy oafs, with overdone falling and overacted hits. Cute and funny as it is, it's excess takes away from the other moments of the movie I think they wanted to achieve. Had these been geared with a little more suspense, and having that adventure style without the intrusion of these wacky antics would have been fantastic to really make these moments the most fun.Super Preachy In The End:
As the ending is winding down, the emotions are running high, and there is a fun adventure moment to try to close the adventure out with, we get the final moments of the movie in a big speech. Emily makes the political speech to offset all the stuff she had done, and it is super preachy to the extent of getting caught up in the in your face moments that movies are becoming. It was cheesy, and lacked the finesse and majesty that I think they were envisioning when designing the final moment. Again, I like the message, I like the heart, and the intent, but the execution was sort of lost to the overdramatic flair that they had it come out.The VERDICT:
Clifford's real life adventure has the heart and soul of the books, and is perfect for the goal of making family fun at the theater. I loved the pacing and energy, had fun with the cute jokes and atmosphere, and appreciated the heartwarming nature this movie brings in the short run time. Clifford is the star of the show by far, and the CGI dog captured much of my attention in design, movement, and character and my highest selling point for this film getting a view. Yet, the movie is geared towards the family environment a little too much, and gets a little ridiculous and over the top to lean away from older audience members. The antagonist is minimal, the excitement diluted by over silly moments, and the story's simplicity leaves it lacking the full growth I had hoped to find in this film. A theater visit can be fun, but if you have been subscribing to Paramount+, then you'll be just fine at home watching this film given the quality, though I would like it to make enough money to get another shot at a sequel, because I love that puppy.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0.Movie Overall: 5.5.",Clifford the Big Red Dog
1346,8,Neptune165,This movie feels like something from like the 2000 era,3/10,20 November 2021,"Paddington was well made. It was supposed to come out like a decade ago but Sony pushed it a lot. Its sad how they are running out of ideas. In every department. Nobody can think of anything original anymore. Its all about trying to make money from people's childhood or anything and ruining them. The CGI is still as bad as it was when Corridor Crew took a look at it months ago it hurts. That's a really bad looking CGI it just didn't blended well with the environment. The characters' eye level when looking at him is also kinda off. I don't think I need to go too far into depth when I say that this movie is obviously not going to be winning any kind of awards. The CGI was sketchy when Emily was riding Clifford. They should of green screened in a real dog (with the image enlarged to make him bigger), and just turn him red... but have an actual dog do all the stuff in a green screen room. I feel like it's easier than making cgi hairs and movements look real.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

1349,11,statuskuo,Hey Girrrrrrl,7/10,10 November 2021,"Clifford The Big Red Dog is indicative of the Boomer generation creation that becomes iconic, in terms of its simplicity. He is big...he is red and he is a dog, no doubt. The 60's, where the books come from, have this sensibility. Making the most basic things blow up in popularity.Though the movie takes place in present day New York City, this movie definitely belongs in a different generation. One that requires that a man who lives in his cube truck be gleefully unapologetic about his lot in life, or that a paralegal and her daughter can afford to live in a large Harlem apartment. Or that everyone in the neighborhood are mystically whimsical and light, then this movie is for you. It may as well be a musical.The story is of a girl for which magic works, and if your brain doesn't accept this, then this film is not for you.I happen to miss this level of innocence. It lacks the cynicism to which politics have ruined everything. It just wants you to like it. Much like Clifford. He is sweet, wide-eyed and has no clue why he is seen as abnormal. Isn't that what we all want?Special kudos to John Cleese speaking lines that would die in any other actor's mouth.Everyone in this flick just seems so happy to do something this light.I genuinely enjoyed this movie and found myself smiling.

1351,13,BrnzReviews,Great Family Movie! Loved It!,8/10,21 November 2021,"Clifford is a lovely movie, the reason i am happy about this being created is that like many of us, i grew up watching the show so this is a beautiful memory to remember. The movie is quite accurate to the show which i think is great and Uncle Casey (Jack Whitehall) is also in the film as you'd expect but I'm mentioning him as i thought he done a great job.I really enjoyed this film, it's a great family movie, it really bought me back to when i was young. I'm really enjoying these live action versions of our favourite films and shows, i hope it never stops.Highly recommend, if you're or were a fan of clifford youll love this, even if you're not you're bound to love it just as much.

For the lack of a better idea of because of laziness on the writer's part we have another film where the main vilain is yet again, you guessed, a big evil tech corporation. Of course, they are after our gargantuan but friendly canine. Haven't we seen this same plot millions of times before? If we substitute the companionable pooch by a cute alien, a kid with some special power, bigfoot's offsprings, a unfrozen caveman, a misplaced baby dinosaur, etc. The story is still the same.What is even funnier is that Holywwod itself is composed by a large number of evil coporations run by very rich white men.All in all, Clifford lacks everything even remotely related to originality.I guess it is an OK film for a not-so-demanding four-year-old child.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

1359,21,cappiethadog,The naive dog,4/10,23 November 2021,"Clifford is a good boy. For starters, he doesn't have rabies. Cujo, however, couldn't help it. It's biology. Film history, however, tells us how a dog can go bad.Carruthers(Burl Ives) trains wild animals; his business supplies lions and tigers and all sorts of exotic beasts to the film and television industry. A R2D2 poster hangs on his office wall. Julie Sawyer(Kristy McNichols) has a problematic German Shepherd; he's an attack dog in need of reprogramming. For the time being, she watches Carruthers throw darts at his perceived enemy, who he refers to as a ""tin can"" during his tirade about how an ""event film"" such as ""Star Wars"" poses a threat to his profession. Samuel Fuller's ""White Dog"", released in 1982 then promptly shelved, proved to be prophetic. Seventeen years later, one can't help remember Hugh Grant as a masquerading Horse and Hound journalist embarrassing himself at a press junket in Roger Michel's ""Notting Hill"", when he asks Anna Scott(Julia Roberts) if there will be any horses(or hounds, for that matter) in her latest film, which happens to be set in space. In retrospect, the scene plays like a homage to Samuel Fuller, who passed away in 1997, two years prior. Fuller wouldn't be alive to see the advent of animatronics. The irony about CGI, of course, is that simulacrum, no matter how beautifully rendered, ends up looking less realistic than fabricated. The spirit of Fuller and industry professionals of Carruther's ilk is slyly suggested in Walt Becker's ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"". The audience can tell right away that the animals Emily(Darby Camp) and Casey(Jack Whiteall), her uncle, see inside the animal rescue tent are not computer-generated. Mr. Bridwell, the proprietor, piques the young client's interest with his menagerie's latest addition, a blood-red puppy. During animal control's sweep of an abandoned warehouse near a pier, they overlooked the canine anomaly, largely because he wasn't playing with his siblings or being tended to by the mother. For an ostracized dog, the red puppy has an affable disposition. Nature versus nurture, that's the subtext of ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"". The title is a pun. Fuller directed ""The Big Red One"", a WWII flick starring Mark Hamill. Bidwell tells the young girl that the puppy's growth dependent on how much love it receives, which is hardly accurate. Since ""Clifford Th Big Red Dog"" comes advertised as a children's movie, it may be harder for some to decipher, but stalking is stalking. That's why Bidwell doesn't leave any footprints on the Internet. There he is, a man who doesn't want to be tracked down, standing outside the house of a vulnerable tween at night. Against Uncle Casey's orders, Bidwell gifts Emily with the red puppy, magically transporting the dog into her backpack. Before settling on the name Clifford, the dog passively rejects Emily's suggestions of Floyd and Ebenezer as potential monikers, but violently reacts, mildly, to Ishmael, a biblical name, which the audience construes as a subtle nod from the filmmaker, perhaps, that he's aware how Clifford could be Hellboy's dog. The DC superhero, too, is fodder for the nature versus nurture dialogue; a different upbringing could have transformed Hellboy into the devil, a Hellman, if you will. Nurture will inevitably win the day in ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"", but Bidwell could not possibly know that at the outset. He grants Emily's wish for Clifford to be bigger. The almost Willie Wonka-like man puts the onus on the young girl in preventing Clifford from being a menace to society. A scholarship kid at a ritzy private school, Emily becomes an easy target for the rich girls, especially Florence(Mia Ronn), who bullies her at school and in cyberspace. Raised by a single mother, Maggie(Sienna Guillory), the absentee parent, we suspect, goes on numerous business trips and doesn't fully grasp the extent of Emily's alienation from her peers. Maggie's foreign accent, despite being American, is a dead giveaway, suggesting that she spends more time abroad than at home. It's an affectation which distances herself from both Emily and her younger brother, who explains to the fragile girl that he was his sister's millstone growing up. Maggie was forced to turndown a scholarship to Oxford, having been suddenly orphaned and forced into surrogate motherhood. The limitations of genre prevents Emily from expressing similar feelings of neglect to her uncle. Bidwell must intuit that Emily is a loner with enemies at school. When he grants Emily's wish, Clifford transforms into a potential enemy to remedy the cruelty of her rivals.Puppies are stupid. Ask any dog owner. You have to train your puppy when they're young, or you have problems with far-reaching consequences going forward. The potential for catastrophic injury attributed to Clifford gigantism is only hinted at, comically, as when Uncle Jack can't stop the red dog's tail from thrashing him against his niece's bedroom walls. It's a fallacy that a puppy would know its own strength; it's a contrivance that Clifford never attempts to jump on Emily, which would result in instantaneous death, due to the impact of her head hitting the wood floor. In essence, the enormous dog is a naive attack dog. In ""White Dog"", Carruther's position on the fate of Julie's German Shepherd coarsens after witnessing the dog's unprovoked attack on an animal shelter employee. He double-downs on euthanizing the four-legged animal upon his realization that the lethal canine selects his victims with an achromatic eye. Keyes(Paul Winfield), Carruther's business partner, isolates this feral beast from the public sphere by staging an intervention of the German Shepherd's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde mind at his own private training facility. Similarly, Emily has a classmate, Owen(Izaac Wang), whose rich father(Russell Wong) arranges for Clifford to live in an animal sanctuary on another continent, away from the general public. ""Clifford The Big Red Dog"" doesn't seem to understand its own writing. Zack(Tony Hale), the CEO of a biotech company, whose mission is to feed the world by supersizing livestock, is the supposed villain, and yet, by imprisoning Clifford in a lab, people, like the ones who run(read: live) in body-enclosing bubbles that the red dog likes to fetch at a public park, don't have to worry about being trampled by a monster dog, albeit friendly, on the loose. Back at Owen's palatial compound, as preparations are being made for Clifford's transfer, the film hints at the incidental violence that the dog was capable of all along. He swallows Owen's pet, a bulldog, whole. Played as comedy, for laughs, the audience isn't supposed to wonder if Clifford may have been hungry. Emily further defuses the implied violence with a joke: ""You don't see that everyday."" Loose on the streets, since Clifford doesn't know his own strength, the possibility of this behemoth mutt accidentally killing somebody always looms. In ""White Dog"", a mother and child enter a grocery store, just escaping notice of the German Shepherd in the foreground, scrounging around for food. The absence of cats, in ""Clifford The Red Dog"", makes it easier for the filmmaker to obfuscate the unrealized collateral damage that a chase would entail. Miraculously, nobody occupies the sidewalk while Clifford whips around the corner to save a man who had fallen from his apartment complex roof. Ironically, Lyfepro has the right idea. The biotech company, under Zack's orders, confines Clifford to their lab facilities where he can't harm innocent bystanders. Whereas Julie, in ""White Dog"", seeks professional help to rehabilitate her damaged German Shepherd, Clifford, equally dangerous in his own right, if not more so, gets no training, only compassion from the audience, because Lyfepro utilizes the innocent dog as a lab animal, tapped for testing. Arguably, Clifford should be put down. Lyfeform is not your stock evil corporation we're trained to root against, Zack's odious personality notwithstanding, since the multi-national corporation's mission statement to feed the world is actually, on closer inspection, a noble one. Ethics aside, tagging Clifford as Lyfepro's property may be unscrupulous, but arguably, a necessary evil. Clifford is Emily's pet, but a dangerous pet, just like Julie's German Shepherd. Hypothetically, if Lyfegrow's scientists discover Clifford's genetic code, isn't the dog's sacrifice beneficial for the greater good? A stronger case for Bidwell as the real antagonist can be mounted. He made Emily sole custodian, a mere child, who in a different sort of film, would be a ticking time bomb with too much power and responsibility.Emily is an outcast; she takes the bullying in stride, never allowing her temper to flare at the injustice of being in Florence's constant crosshairs. She resents Emily's poverty. The children's film isn't Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"", but a dissonant subtext hangs in the diegetic air. During the cafeteria scene, Emily prepares Clifford's lunch, a platter of pigs in a blanket, an allusion, perhaps, to Dawn Wiener. What would ""Wiener Dog"" do to her enemies, the taunting cheerleaders at lunchtime, if endowed with a big puppy? Would she train him to attack like the German Shepherd's original owner, Wilbur(Parley Baer), who appears late in ""White Dog"" to reclaim his property from Julie. Armed with a ketchup bottle, Emily squirts the popular condiment on Florence's blouse, which looks like retaliation for the constant harassment, even though the badgered girl claims otherwise; an accident. The ketchup acts as performative blood. Clifford, like any dog, can sniff out its owner's enemies, and zeroes in on Florence as Emily's foe. He drools on her. The saliva is performative, too. Bidwell, in essence, gave Emily the means to avenger her peers, but like Julie in ""White Dog"", Clifford is destined to be a companion animal.Clifford is a good boy. There are no bad dogs, only bad owners. Emily is a good girl.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

Emily's Mother is called away on business and must leave her daughter with her irresponsible Brother. During a trip to school is where Emily and Clifford meet and with the help of a magical animal ""carer"" the story begins. Lots of Comedic actors you will be familiar with and all funny.

Clifford had a sense of cuteness to him despite being a fake dog....the child actress who played Emily-Elizabeth was both adorable and made you feel sorry for her. The bully downside was the bully was very lame and the main villain did overact a bit, but Emily and Clifford had a very ""Air Bud"" type of relationship. You felt she really loved him and that made the movie really good for me.

1372,34,bkgseoul,Not was I thought,8/10,12 November 2021,"Been a HUGE fan of Clifford since I could remember. I read the books and watched the series. Saw the TONS of trailers while watching other things & so I only got Paramount Plus for my toddler. Wasn't the storyline I thought it would be, didn't like the bullying but I LOVED itthe film.

1373,35,brian-mata,Cute but not like childhood,7/10,21 November 2021,"This movie is cute, with some action scenes, fun sets, and a fairly likeable and convincing lead actress.However, for nostalgia chasers, it is a definite departure from the characters and setting you know and love from childhood. Emily Elizabeth lives alone in the city with her mother, and falls into the care of her haphazard uncle Casey - not to be confused with KC, our easygoing three-legged canine friend from the TV series. Though the new cast is mostly endearing, you will not find the familiar faces or voices of Cleo, Samuel, Jetta, and all the rest in this film.While the central theme remains that Emily's love and nurturing of Clifford enabled him to grow so large, the plot is really driven by the intervention of a mysterious magical figure (albeit with delightful character design). The vague core lesson is ""be kind to people who are different"". There are a couple of heart-tugging moments, so be prepared to cry a little. Many of the jokes are low-brow, but a few did land a laugh from me.Overall, it's worth watching once as a stand-alone.A content warning for parents: This movie has A LOT of butt-themed humor. Also of note is the mention of a character having lost his hand in a meat grinder (all that is shown is his new prosthetic hand), an action scene in which one character punches another in the face, and the offscreen death of an elderly man in a hospital.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

They live in an apartment but in the series they lived in a house. I don't think these creators actually looked into the show before making this movie. The actors are terrible actors. Clifford did not live in New York he lived in an island which is inspired by Massachusetts so why is this filmed in new York? I expected better but this was a true disappointment and a waste of my time. If I could give a 0 I would.

The movie was geared towards young children, but the whole family will enjoy it, was able to focus on it and not stare at my phone. Only complaint is I thought he would be bigger. The characters chemistry was good, even though it was a children's movie I thought the story could of had a little more substance. Worth a watch close to the books.

1388,50,Reelty,That dog too big.,9/10,26 November 2021,"Clifford The Big Red Dog is a powerful, smashingly effective movie - not a great movie but one that will probably stir audiences' emotions and join the ranks of such pop-mythology films such as Fern Gully and Home Alone 2. Maybe even Max Keeble's Big Move.When Clifford is viciously funny, he's on top of things, and he scores and scores, and illuminates as he scores. When he becomes didactic, we can see that he really doesn't know anymore about what should be done than the rest of us. The more 'direct' Clifford is, the more fuzzy and obscure he is. Who can assimilate and evaluate this giant red canine as he runs amuck amongst the denizens of a modern Big Apple?Even while you're convulsed with laughter, you're still apprehensive, because the editing rhythms are very tricky, and the shock images loom up huge, right on top of you, like a large rouge hound. There are parts of 'Clifford The Big Red Dog' that suggest what Eisenstein might have done if he hadn't intellectualized himself out of reach - if he'd given in to the bourgeois child in himself.Director Walt Becker has diddled over a small idea too long; perhaps intentionally, this is a reductio ad absurdum. The will-he-or-won't-he game (an intellectualized version of the plight of modern animal adoption) goes on so long that the squeamish hero must rise from strife to protect what she holds dear.The audience is alive to it. Our experience as we watch it has some connection, Clifford The Big Red Dog keeps the audience in a kind of eager, nervous imbalance-it holds our attention by throwing our disbelief back in our faces. To be put on is to be put on the spot, put on the stage, made the stooge in a comedy act.The whole picture is informed with such a complex sense of the intermingling of good and evil - and of the inability to foresee the effects of our love upon our children and big dogs - that it may be the most passionately felt epic ever made in this country.That being said, I'm taking a star of because that dog too big. Dogs not big like truck. Dogs big like goat. This dog way too big.",Clifford the Big Red Dog
1389,51,dukereel,A film made specifically for children...and it understood the assignment,8/10,21 November 2021,"Takeaways...1. The messaging of the film that stood out for me was around ""looking for acceptance"" and ""feeling like an outcast/feeling different."" For the most part, the messaging was decent throughout the story. It was the inconsistency with outcast vs difference that was a small concern for me, though.In Act One, the story does a great job showing how both characters were either dealing with being an outcast/being different, &/or became an outcast/became different. Even the uncle fit the messaging.Act Two felt more of a celebration of the ""BIG"" obvious difference, which seemed like a detour from what Act One set up. Additionally, Tieran putting that random bug in the Police Chief's ear eventually became a forced and false perspective to try and make the ""outcast"" and ""need for acceptance"" work/make sense.Act Three followed through well from Act Two, and for a while ended up feeling like a separate side story built around this infatuation with Clifford being different-which was completely different from Act One. Then the end of Act Three tried to force the ""acceptance,"" ""outcast,"" and ""difference"" into one statement as if the entire story was a journey of learning to understand those three ideas within one's self when technically, those conflicts were quickly abandoned after Act One to focus on the intrigue of this ""Big Red Dog.""2. The CGI wasn't the strongest when Clifford was a puppy. It was the neck area for me...3. Uncle Casey was a good character to have on this journey with Emily. I enjoyed Jack Whitehall...4. I am not sure how I feel about this random ass Lyfegrow company...it wasn't a bad inclusion to the story, but I definitely could've used more intentional background and subtle images of this company throughout the story.5. The story of Clifford the Big Red Dog is about a girl new to the city who comes across this one of a kind puppy who's uniqueness soon becomes a target that must be protected. For a PG rating, the story was pretty solid despite its flaws.Act One is a typical exposition where viewers are introduced to our title character who is visually ""one of a kind"" and also follows through on the theme of being different. This is the same for our introduction of Emily whose interaction with girls at school + dialogue with her mom also stays intact with the theme.Act Two is the Clifford we all know, a true one of a kind, and the introduction of our villain + the setting of the target. Although the story doesn't stick with the theme well, it carries out the primary story of seeing this unique dog, and adds a simple ""PG"" conflict for said uniqueness.Act Three is an advocation for the love of this unique animal, and protecting it from the conflict while attempting to tie things back to the theme-to the PG audience, it won't be as obvious, but to those really paying attention... ...6. However, to point #2, Big Clifford's CGI was really good!7. So Clifford is just trained already?8. This movie moves pretty well, especially for its set demographic.I remembered seeing a Tiktok where this man was comparing different children's shows to that of Coco Melon to show why it's such toddler crack. In this comparison, he talked about how often the screen shifts in Coco Melon which constantly engages the eye, and this is what the pacing was like in Clifford--scenes constantly moving with characters to engage with quite often (especially when I think about Mr. And Mrs. Jarvis, or Malik), especially with Clifford having some reason to either run through the streets of New York, or jump out of the van.9. Even though they were clever to have the brother make the statement about when he and his sister moved to the states... they really tried it with mom and brother having different accents...10. There really wasn't strong consistency with Emily and her personal conflict, nor with how her and Clifford seemed to have this paralleled experience. If anything, the strength of the characters really comes through in Acts 2 and 3 when everything is centered on Clifford and his overall protection, which definitely follows through well with the main premise of the story.Now the character arc/development was solid with Clifford and the trio of humans vs Emily. Emily's character technically doesn't have anything interesting until Clifford puts her into situations which then creates the target that adds more interesting situations to be put into. But my issue is how the story begins with Emily isn't what the arc focuses on-it shifts to the title character, as it should, but then I wonder what other way could this film have started off with Emily being more of a supporting, static character?I could even see the film starting with just Clifford roaming the streets of New York, lost and afraid; and then catching the eye of Emily who picks him up, takes him home where there's a disagreement with her mom about keeping him, but she sneaks and keeps him anyway; when she wakes up he's miraculously big, and then she hears a knock on the door which is her uncle (her mom leaves a note that she had to run out), and when the uncle comes in he encounters Clifford, and the film continues....Basically, just get to Clifford and forget abut the humans.* * *
Overall #CliffordTheBigRedDog gives Sims Pets - meets Mighty Joe Young - meets Beethoven - meets Mr. MagoriumHonestly, for families with 3-6 year olds, this film is worth the watch. Acts Two and Three definitely provide a different feel to the film that keeps it engaging-especially for that age group.Now as an adult, will you find enjoyment sitting in the theater with your child/children? Eh... maybe not. There's not really anything in this film that cleverly caters to the adult humor-it is very much a PG film-so I'd consider watching it on Paramount+ vs going to the theaters so you can disappear and leave your children alone.I also still can't get over how they reeeeaaally tried it with justifying / making sense of those different accents (LOL). I just can't.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

But the movie ended up being really good. My kids loved it and I did too! I thought the jokes were funny, the action was good and the plot made sense, I mean as much sense as a Big Red dog running through New York City could.The only reason I didn't give ten stars was because I expected more from CGI in 2021. Cliffords head was smaller in proportion to his body but I'm just being picky! Overall, this was a great family movie for us and one we will watch more than a few times.

1394,56,nb99,Funny in Places and the Kids Enjoyed it.,7/10,29 November 2021,"It's a fairly predictable, feel good, family movie. There are some genuinely funny scenes, though pretty much all of them appear in the trailer, so maybe avoid that if you can. The plot has been seen many times before. The dog is cute and steels the show throughout. The kids laughed a lot and now all want a red puppy for Christmas! Don't look for too much plot, character development etc and you'll have a fun 90 minutes.

1399,61,aansofie-guzik,International Broken Family?,6/10,16 November 2021,"I saw this on Saturday with my niece and nephew (9 & 6). It was a fun film; cute dog, hijinks and heart warming moments. But now it's Monday night and there is something I have not been able to stop thinking about.What happened to the family of Maggie (Mom) and Casey (Uncle)? Maggie has a British accent and the actor is British. Casey has an American accent and the actor is British. Why does the character of Casey have an American accent?I would have chalked this up to kids movie = lazy but they actually try to address it in the movie. At one point, Uncle Casey talks with Emily and says something to the effect of ""I moved here when I was 2 that's why I don't have an accent"". Since Casey moved and doesn't have an accent, we can infer that because the mom still does have an accent she must have stayed in England. Who did Uncle Casey move to New York with at such a young age? There are no grandparent characters or even a mention of grandparents. Did their parents get a divorce and one moved to America with just one of the children? That's tragic!And when did Maggie move to New York? Emily does not have an accent so we assume that she's grown up in American at least from primary school age. Is Emily's dad British? I can't remember anything being said about about the dad from the film. Did he meet Maggie in England, they then moved to New York and then have Emily? Did Maggie move to NY to be there for her brother, it doesn't seem like they are that involved in each other's lives consistently. Emily didn't even know her uncle was living out of a van!This could have been so much simpler if the mom also had an American accent! In a kids film about a girl and a magical dog, why even bother with an international parent that conflicts with Uncle Casey to the point of requiring out of place expositional dialogue to half explain the dissonance?Jack Whitehall IS British! They could have just had both them be British and have some line about why if they are going to do lazy explaining anyway!Or the mom could have been American, making more sense with Emily's accent and then have a British uncle, that's the most plausible and charming solution!I don't get the logic and I can't believe how this unessential plot point has garnered so much reaction from myself days later! What. Is. Happening.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

1401,63,shalycemutchie,"Surface level, but still a fun time.",7/10,25 November 2021,"I LOVED Clifford growing up. I was skeptical about this movie, because reboots of older shows tend to be terrible.Maybe it was the coffee I drank or the jokes my family was making, but I left this movie with a big smile on my face. It was goofy, engaging enough to keep us focused on it, and properly endearing. Of course it wraps up being sickeningly precious, and the theme is smashed in your face and rubbed in. But, this is a child's movie. It isn't supposed to be nuanced. Don't expect anything intellectual or deep.The CGI wasn't great, but creating a large, alive animal with fur is pretty difficult, so I don't hold that against the movie. The acting was about as great as you can expect from a movie like this, but I do give credit to the girl playing Emily Elizabeth because she was capable of summoning excellent crying on the spot, and even adult actors aren't capable of that. Outside of that, she wasn't great.I cried real tears. I belly laughed. And I rolled my eyes. All in all, I would watch it again and I recommend it to children and adults who are willing to just hop on and enjoy the ride without a critical eye.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

It was a cute movie, but I found the CGI/animation proportions of Clifford's head vs body were sometimes a bit off. The plot was okay, at times it was a bit cheesy. But overall my kids were happy with this movie.

It shares very little similarities with the cartoon we all loved as a child. There were absent characters and an off-the-wall story line that didn't seem to line up. Emily Elizabeth looks and acts nothing like she does in the original. Overall, it felt like someone who knew nothing about Clifford was hired to write a movie about a big red dog.

1408,70,andyjwallander,Throw the book out the window.,2/10,11 November 2021,"Other than there being a big red dog with a little girl named Emily Elizabeth, there is absolutely nothing in comparison to the books. One again we see a single mom (who has a British accent?) and a hapless white male (her brother who does not have an accent). The plot is completely predictable with a large company coming after the little girl and the city coming together to stop them.Why can't Hollywood understand that not everyone lives in a big city now do we want to. Clifford involved a family (with a dad I might add) who moves it of the city to the county. But in typical Hollywood fashion they removed the dad and the country.

1417,79,thehypermuse,Not the Stove I Know,7/10,18 November 2021,"This movie is cute, with some action scenes, fun sets, and a fairly likeable and convincing lead actress.However, for nostalgia chasers, it is a definite departure from the characters and setting you know and love from childhood. Emily Elizabeth lives alone in the city with her mother, and falls into the care of her haphazard uncle Casey - not to be confused with KC, our easygoing three-legged canine friend from the TV series. Though the new cast is mostly endearing, you will not find the familiar faces or voices of Cleo, Samuel, Jetta, and all the rest in this film.While the central theme remains that Emily's love and nurturing of Clifford enabled him to grow so large, the plot is really driven by the intervention of a mysterious magical figure (albeit with delightful character design). The vague core lesson is ""be kind to people who are different"". There are a couple of heart-tugging moments, so be prepared to cry a little. Many of the jokes are low-brow, but a few did land a laugh from me.Overall, it's worth watching once as a stand-alone.A content warning for parents: This movie has A LOT of butt-themed humor. Also of note is the mention of a character having lost his hand in a meat grinder (all that is shown is his new prosthetic hand), an action scene in which one character punches another in the face, and the offscreen death of an elderly man in a hospital.",Clifford the Big Red Dog

It seems to me that too many times recently kids movies aree too emotional and/or try to incorporate too many adult themes or issues. Clifford the big red dog successfully avoids overly dramatic or adult issues. The storyline could have been better developed and there are some holes in the story, but overall it was a great afternoon with a light hearted comedy that made the kids and me laugh. Hopefully this was the beginning of a series of Clifford movies that remain light hearted but can grow with the children.

1422,84,aprilhenson,Adorable movie. Inappropriate advertising,10/10,25 November 2021,"The movie is awesome. Clifford was my favorite show as a child so was excited to have a movie for my son to see however I thought it was EXTREMELY disgusting that they used a teenager rapping to the beat of baby got back which refers to women's butts shaking in men's faces. How could someone making a children's movie think that was ever ok?

1424,86,rayxucool,Intended For Young Audiences,7/10,27 November 2021,"Was very excited to see this movie being released as it had always been one of my favorite childhood books. The movie itself is pretty good with an intriguing yet otherwise cliche plot. There is an antagonist introduced, as expected, and the movie plays along with the good guys defending Clifford from the bad guys. There are many scenes that you can obviously expect to see (referring back to the cliche plot,) and there are many scenes that are otherwise very awkward to watch. Overall a good movie but intended for families and young audiences.

1427,0,Quinoa1984,Heartfelt but earns it's heart - a big nostalgic wonder,8/10,14 November 2021,"What was it Mike Nichols once said, a film is like a person and either you trust it or you dont? I think that could be said for Belfast but I thought of it more about a kind of personality that a filmmaker brings to a work as well as the cast and everyone else involved, and on that note Belfast to me is a total sweetheart of a movie, where it has many moments where it's quite cute and charming, but it's always based around the fact that this family is doing their best and more or less succeeding in caring for one another and (as Dornan's dad points out towards the end to the little boy when he asks about if a Catholic can be with a Protestant) what the basic power of kindness can do.It's a film that manages the feat of having sentiment and even some sentimentality, but earning it throughout because (outside of maybe the bookends where the ""Troubles"" and all that horrible violence in the streets comes knocking) it doesn't cheapen what the stakes are or what these characters are going through. The basic question of ""staying or leaving"" is not one we haven't seen before in other films, and I'm sure we'll see again, yet Branaugh as writer/director gives the people here this honesty that is a family that is there together and there is this struggle (mostly for dad) to keep it together.This is beautifully rendered as well with this point of view coming from the little boy (standing in for Branaugh at that time I can assume but as with like Roma who knows) as he peers in on these arguments and conversations that have a repetition that isn't repetitive, if that makes sense. If you've been in a family that has money problems, this is just the way it is, and Dornan and especially Balfe have this chemistry that works perfectly.Another thing in its favor: you think the little boy Buddy (played by Jude Hill) will be cute and his interactions with others, especially the grandparents (good lord do Dench and Hinds, the latter I hope gets an Oscar, steal every scene they're in) could get tiresome, but Branaugh manages to keep him engaging and this mix that's hard to describe where he's universal and specific, like you don't even have to be a little boy just like at some time if you were young and trying to figure out a world that has so much stuff in it and there's the escape of movies and the wonder of astronauts alongside the horror of men in the streets throwing molotov cocktails... OK that part isn't everyone's experience, but there's little things Branaugh gets so right as a writer; my favorite is when his older cousin ropes him in as part of a ""gang"" initiation to steal something from the local sweet shop. How that resolves itself is ::chefs kiss::This whole thing reminds me of like what if you took one of those stories of childhood via Frank McCourt (or Malachy, one of those) and imbued it with a lot more warmth and a generosity of spirit, and it's in general a difficult movie to dislike or be too hard on without sounding like a grouch without any feelings. At the same time, I am critical of how the film opens and comes to a climax inasmuch as the ""Troubles"" set pieces are shot and presented in this tremendous manner that, of course, are impossible to ignore as far as the history at the time in Ireland and that city as a wholeBut it can't help but feel like... this is where it's a MOVIE in large letters, shot in an intense style like this is where it all becomes so overwhelming, which makes sense given the POV of this boy, and at the same time it loses that intimacy you have throughout the rest of the film, where it's power is in showing life's little moments having even more of a lasting impact. Also, with the one supporting character trying to force the Dad to pick a side as the one person I didn't quite believe (not the actor so much as the character, kind of one note you know). As a small technical aside, as much as I like Branaugh's eye for compositions (both usual and unusual, his framing is off in interesting ways), the digital quality of it all is distracting for me, and I wish this was shot on film for that crisper look.All that doesn't take away from the pathos that is all here, with humor that works because it's based around like how much we may have enjoyed being around people like this in our families. Is it idealized? I don't know, but it doesn't come across as that, if anything it shows that the human soul and spirit can be resilient and this is a lesson for kids all over but also ones for the adults, too. How is one any *good* in a family? Hard to say, except it comes down to being there and not giving up. That's the kind of tone Belfast has, and it is filled with little grace notes - one that I'm sure to remember is when Dench's grandma tells the grandpa before he has to go to the hospital that she will go with him by bus and take him in and stay with him till its all done and then take him home. She doesn't state it in any way that sounds false, and none of (admittedly very good) Van Morrison music to score this beat. It's just two people who have a love that is self evident by actions.So, in short: a sweet-heart of a movie, not to mention last but certainly not least that this is a fun time of expressing how remembering history through some pop-culture filtering can be entertaining and insightful (High Noon song, anyone?)",Belfast
1428,1,ferguson-6,the dilemma,8/10,11 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Despite Irish ancestry, during my childhood, Ireland was vaguely described as a place to avoid due to the Northern Ireland Conflict (also known as The Troubles). In contrast, the childhood of writer-director Kenneth Branagh was smack dab in the middle of this political and religious mess. This autobiographical project is a sentimental look back at his youth and the connection to his career as a filmmaker. This is very attractive and appealing filmmaking, and one that acknowledges the violent atmosphere without dwelling on it.An opening aerial view of present day Belfast shipyards in full color abruptly transitions back to black and white 1969. A young boy plays and skips cheerfully as he makes his way through the apparently idyllic neighborhood. The pleasantries are shattered and give way to the frenzied fear and havoc created by an approaching angry mob. The native Protestants' goal is to push out all Catholics from the area. The happy young boy we first see is Buddy (played by newcomer Jude Hill), the stand-in for Branagh as a child. While watching, we must keep in mind that we are seeing things unfold through Buddy's eyes - which are actually the eyes of a middle-aged director looking back on his upbringing. This explains the sentimentality and nostalgia, two aspects handled exceedingly well.Buddy and his older brother Will (Lewis McAskie) live with their parents Ma (Caitriona Balfe, FORD V FERRARI, ""Outlander"") and Pa (Jamie Dornan, ""The Fall""), and are close with Granny (Oscar winner Judi Dench) and Pop (Ciaran Hinds, one of the finest supporting actors working today). Pa spends much of his time away in London working as a carpenter, leaving Ma parenting diligently to create normalcy for the boys during tumultuous times. An added stress is the financial woes Ma and Pa face over tax debt. Granny and Pop are an endearing elderly couple still very much in love, despite their constant needling and bickering.As things escalate, the division over religion becomes more prevalent. Although he attempts to stay out of the fracas, Pa is faced with the ""either with us or against us"" decision - something he avoids as long as possible. Ma is obsessed with keeping her boys on the straight and narrow, despite their naivety and the many forces pulling them away. The family finds its emotional escape at the local cinema, which treats us to clips of bikini-clad Raquel Welch in ONE MILLION YEARS BC; Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper facing off with a similar 'stay or go' dilemma in HIGH NOON; John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE; and Dick Van Dyke in his flying car from CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG. The sense of awe and wonder is laid on a bit thick for effect, but it helps us connect young Buddy with present day Branagh.It's quite a family dilemma. How do you decide to pack up and leave the only town you've ever called home, and when do you make that decision? When does the danger and turmoil pose too much to risk for your kids? There is a fun scene that provides young Buddy a lesson on how to answer, ""Are you Protestant or Catholic?"" It plays comically but has a serious undertone. Speaking of Buddy, newcomer Jude Hall in his feature film debut, uses his sparkling eyes and an engaging smile to light up the screen. His adolescent pining for Catherine (Olive Tennant), the smart girl in his class, is worthy of the price of admission. All of the actors are terrific, and in addition to young Mr. Hall, it's Caitriona Balfe (as Ma) whose performance really stands out. Award considerations should be in her future.Filmmaker Branagh has assembled a crew of frequent collaborators, including cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, who works wonders with the monochromatic scheme. The soundtrack is chock full of Van Morrison songs - it is Ireland, after all, and the overall feeling is that this is a film Branagh needed to make in order to deal with his childhood prior to his family relocating to England. By not avoiding The Troubles, yet not focusing on it, Branagh has told his story in a personal way that should be relatable to many. It's a terrific film.BELFAST opens in theaters on November 12, 2021.",Belfast
1429,2,stevendbeard,Slice of Irish Life,6/10,28 November 2021,"I saw Belfast, starring Jamie Dornan-Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, the 50 Shades movies; Caitriona Balfe-Outlander_tv, Escape Plan; Ciaran Hinds-Red Sparrow, Game of Thrones_tv; Judi Dench-Cats, the Bond movies and introducing Jude Hill-this is his first movie.This movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh and it's based on his childhood in Belfast Ireland during the 1960's. Jude plays the young boy trying to grow up during lots of civil unrest, with rioters plundering the neighborhoods-mostly fighting about religion between the Protestants and the Catholics-and street gangs extorting the people for protection. Jamie is Jude's father, who works away from home a lot and Caitriona is his mother, trying to keep the family together and keep the tax collectors at bay. Ciaran and Judi are his grandparents, offering life lessons that help shape his future. So, if you are interested in a slice of life of an Irish kid during the 1960's, you've come to the right place.It's rated PG-13 for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.I wouldn't buy it on DVD but if you are interested in the subject matter, it would be a good rental.",Belfast
1430,3,st-shot,Branagh Amarcord,6/10,16 November 2021,"Director Kenneth Branagh returns to his childhood past in Belfast, a black and white memory of the age old struggle between Protestant and Catholic during heightened tension between the two in the late 60s and early 70s known as The Troubles. Branagh and clan left early in a conflict that would go beyond Northern Ireland borders and last 30 years so the title can be a touch deceptive in that it deals more with a family in conflict than present an all encompassing overview of a city and its people under duress that certain places (ex: Dunkirk) evoke.Belfast is mostly seen through the eyes of a child, impressively played by Jude Hill, as he tries to make sense of all the calamity as well as understand the logic of his parents and grandparents. As the parents in crisis Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan share some powerful scenes together while Ciaran Hinds turns in his standard solid work and Judy Dench delivers some touching moments as the grandparents.Branagh's direction is inconsistent though with some scenes flat and near pointless. His mise en scene rings artificial and some of his minor casting has a falseness to it as well. Branagh also shies away from expressing the deep seeded hatred between the two groups in favor of the family dynamic at play and in doing so dilutes the desperation they face. A mediocre nostalgia piece whose title and place in history deserves much deeper examination.",Belfast

BELFAST Writer\Producer\Director Ken B. Goes OZ one better in helming a flick which is 99% B & W, and just 1% in color. Furthermore, Ken does just the opposite of OZ: he opens and closes in color, but all the action and dialog is in wonderful black and white.

1432,5,richard-1787,An often deeply moving movie,8/10,27 November 2021,"""Belfast"" is a deeply moving film that recounts, often from a young boy's perspective, what it was like to live n Belfast in 1969 at the outbreak of that round of Protestant-Catholic violence. It held me riveted to my seat from almost start to finish. The acting was uniformly first rate. Some of the action was hard for me to understand because I don't know the history of that conflict well. Perhaps that could have been helped with more exposition?My one real problem with segments of this movie was the accents. Just as the mother worries that, if they were to move to England to follow her husband's job, they would not be understood by half of the English, so I had real problems understanding some of the dialogue, because I am not used to hearing the Irish speak.But this should not dissuade anyone from seeing the movie! Not at all. I mentioned this problem to the manager of the theater (Regal) after the show, and he told me that the theater could have supplied me, free of charge, with glasses that would have let me see the movie's evidently embedded closed captions.So, if any of you go and get discouraged because you can't understand all the dialogue, ask if your movie theater has such spectacles. I wish I had known about them They would have saved me a certain amount of aggravation.As it is, I will rent the movie when it comes out on dvd so that I can watch it with closed captions and see what I could not understand. It's definitely a movie that is worth a second viewing.",Belfast
1433,6,rannynm,"The Equivalent Of A Stormy, Rainy Day, Calm-Before-The-Storm Kind Of Feeling",10/10,6 November 2021,"Belfast is the equivalent of a stormy, rainy day, creating a perfect calm-before-the-storm kind of feeling. Written and directed by Kenneth Branagh, this family story is a tasteful, bittersweet masterpiece.Set in a small neighborhood in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s, Buddy (Jude Hill), a young boy from a small-town family, experiences life in tumultuous times. As religious tensions between the tight-knit community members grow, his family dodges shady neighbors and argues the question of moving out of Belfast while Buddy tries to ace his time tables. Belonging to the struggling working class, Buddy's father (Jamie Dornan) often travels for weeks at a time leaving him and his older brother (Lewis McAskie) to explore Belfast on their own. However, their father and mother (Caitriona Balfe) are always there to protect them when danger comes their way.Four things really stand out to me watching this film. First, the use of black and white with some color is really outstanding. It creates a sense of nostalgia and the few choice moments with color helps those scenes stand out. Second, the sound is absolutely fantastic. In every scene, there is a sound effect that enhances it, it's the sound of rain, fire, or a buzzing television. The quality of the sound effects is astounding, adding another layer of engagement when watching this film. Third, the acting is especially impressive. Young talent Jude Hilly, especially, is quite a star and steals the show. I also love the talent of Caitriona Balfe, who masters the strength and emotion of a mother. Lastly, every scene is very intimate; the camera is always up and close to the action and the family, making audiences feel closer to the main characters.Kenneth Branagh's film, based on a true story from his own childhood, touches audiences' hearts with an intimate view of family and the struggles of the working class. Parents should be aware there is some profanity, mention of religion, aggression and minor violence.I rate Belfast 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults.

1434,7,bankofmarquis,Underwhelming,6/10,21 November 2021,"The trouble with hearing that a film is a ""shoo-in"" Oscar film is that I go in with expectations and, sometimes, there is no way the film can live up to the expectations that I have for it.Such is the case with the new film Written and Directed by Kenneth Branagh, his personal remembrance BELFAST.Professionally made, with a strong cast and some decent dialogue, BELFAST tells the tale of a young boy growing up in Ireland when ""the troubles"" (the Irish Civil War between Protestants and Catholics of the late 1960's) erupts and the family must turn against friends and neighbors and make the difficult decision as to what side of the conflict they should be one - and whether they should stay in Ireland or move to England.We see this world through the eyes of 9 year old Buddy (Jude Hill). Consequently, we only gets bit and pieces of the story as he starts to understand what is going on. And that is part of the problem with this film. We receive the information in bits and pieces on the level of a child. And the premise just doesn't work, for his parents and grandparents constantly attempt to shield the child from the goings-on in the world (and thus shield the audience).Branagh's script is underwritten and slight - but he turns it over to some tremendous performers who elevate it to something better than it is.Veteran actors Dame Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds are fine comic relief in this film as the Grandparents who are wise and seeing that the world that they once knew is changing. These two aging thespians bring a spark to this film, for it is pretty limp otherwise.The conflict between Pa (Jamie Doran - 50 SHADES OF GREY) and Ma (Citrione Balfe - OUTLANDER) over the families' reaction to the events outside of their home never really crescendoes with any power. Again, I blame the writing. The conflict between these two is just not interesting enough. So, if I don't blame the writing, I'll blame the Directing - which is also by Branagh.Balfe is being touted as a Best Actress Oscar contender, and I can see how she might get one, as she does have ""the Oscar Speech"", but there is not much more to recommend here.This film is professionally done and acted well enough - there just needed to be more ""there"" there.Letter Grade B-6 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Belfast
1435,8,kjproulx,A Highly Enjoyable Feel-Good Film,8/10,18 November 2021,"I'll admit that I'm a sucker for feel-good films that are done well. A feel-good film with great dialogue, set-up, and payoff sometimes end up being some of my favourite films of their consecutive year. I had heard nothing but praise about Belfast before seeing it and the fact that I heard multiple times that this is the ""feel-good movie of the year"" instantly made me eager to watch it. While I wouldn't give it quite that much praise, it's a very, very solid film. Here's why, if for nothing else, you should check out this little film that will more than likely put a smile on your face.Living in Belfast, Ireland in the late 1960s wasn't very easy for a lot of families. For the most part, the focus of this film is on Buddy, a young boy who is just trying to be a kid and figure out where he fits in. With his parents struggling and gangs being a bad influence on him, he becomes a little too curious and influenced by others. It's a very simple story about a family trying to live normal lives, but there are a lot of undertones that elevate the subject matter as well. There were many times where I wished I could've stepped in and helped this boy make the right decisions, which is what I believe the point of this film truly was.As I watched this film, I continuously felt the need to discover the hidden messages in the dialogue, because sometimes the movie just didn't seem to be going anywhere until the second half. Belfast takes a lot of time to just settle you into the lives of these people, but it also has a very short run time, so the big incidents throughout the film feel very few and far between. Director Kenneth Branagh is at the helm here and his work is very hit or miss for me. One thing he has always been great at though is getting great performances out of his cast. Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan both shine here as Buddy's parents, and the weight of the film is really on the shoulders for where this boy ends up in the world. I thought that was easily the strongest point of the film as a whole.At its core, Belfast is simply a love letter to classic black and white films. Although hardly anyone will make this comparison, I thought of the film Bicycle Thieves multiple times while watching this film. Not the heavy dramatic aspect of that film, but the father trying to be a role model for his son, while having no idea what to do or even being able to be around. At the same time, that also felt heartwarming by the end as well. I really enjoyed watching this film. From the terrific cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos (some of the best ever in a Branagh film) to the very simple, subtle screenplay, I felt immersed in this story. I personally don't think it deserves as much hype as it's receiving, but it's more than worth your time.",Belfast
1436,9,sweidman-28016,Heartfelt But Left Me Wanting More Out of It,7/10,30 October 2021,"""If they can't hear you, then they're not listening.""Kenneth Branaugh's Belfast is an autobiographical account from his childhood. It depicts a story about a young boy and his working class family experiencing the tumultuous late 1960s in the hometown of Belfast. I'm going to say it, I've never been taken away by Branaugh's direction in the past. He's a great actor and all, but when it comes to filmmaking, everything I've seen from him has either just been okay or disappointed. Maybe it's because he's never made something as personal as this. Though I don't think it's as wonderful as everyone makes it out to be, I did find myself enjoying Belfast. It manages to create a story centered around family and what it feels like to be a child growing up in a place that's dear to you. With the story being almost auto-biographical, you see the world as Branaugh did. It's a fun and lovely story, even if it touches on heavier subjects like loss and riots. I found the screenplay to be written well. Honestly, this movie could very well be considered a comedy. It's full of humor and light. Still, it can play out a bit melodramatic, especially the end. The ending for me was a little abrupt. I was told there was going to be a scene full of emotion to make everyone cry, but that moment passed and it was the end. I'm glad it ended on that note instead of Branaugh's original ending which had a documentary sort of thing going on and him returning to Belfast. Luckily we have editors to cut things out.What made the movie, at least for me, were the performances. With the likes of Caitriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, Judi Dench, and Ciarán Hinds you're in for some great acting. Dench and Hinds have smaller performances than the others but play the perfect grandparents you'd want. Dornan, and though we've known he's a better actor than his work in the 50 Shades series, is great and has a lot of fun with his more serious role that does get to have some fun. The absolute best comes from Balfe. She's the best part of the whole movie. For me, she was that part that made the movie most emotionally gripping. And then there's Jude Hill who is the only lead. He may be whiny and that irritating kid sometimes, but he sees the world as a new adventure everyday which is always pleasant to watch. As his first major role and at such a young age, I believe he did a good job. Branaugh set out to make a movie that would possibly win him awards and be the crowd pleaser of the year. Personally, I don't think his direction was all that amazing. He does a good job, but it felt like we've seen variations of the movie already and it was easy to know everything to come. As stylistic as he may try to make it out to be, the only stylish thing is the black-and-white cinematography and all the movies and stage performances are shown in color. I don't think everything he did works (the first couple minutes of the movie did not start out so great), but he did make a solid movie in the end. Belfast is a heartfelt watch and has great performances and good writing, but I ended wanting more out of it. I do think this will go well with audiences and critics, some calling it the best of the year. It comes out in a couple weeks and is bound to win some Oscars, so check it out if you'd like.",Belfast
1437,10,steiner-sam,Fictionalized story of Branagh's last year in Belfast,9/10,17 November 2021,"It's set in 1969 Belfast, Northern Ireland. It's a fictionalized, but autobiographical story of Branagh's last year in Belfast where he was born before moving as a nine-year-old to England where his father worked.Buddy (Jude Hill) is the younger son of Ma (Caitríona Balfe) and Pa (Jamie Dornan). They live in a Belfast workingclass community that is majority Protestant, but includes Catholics with whom they have always lived peaceably. Pa's work as a skilled joiner is in England, so he's only home every other weekend. When the Troubles begin Ma and Pa take a principled stance against distinguishing friend and foe on the basis of religion. Local radical Protestants try to force Pa to take a position, as well as trying to involve Buddy and his older brother, Will (Lewis McAskie), in fairly minor tasks, like taking messages.Despite the Troubles, Buddy has a good life within a family where he is loved, especially by his paternal grandparents, Pop (Ciarán Hinds) and Granny (Judi Dench). Buddy is also precocious enough to develop a friendship with a bright Catholic girl in his class named Mary (Olivia Flanagan).The family experiences a number of conflicts as the film unfolds, both within the family between Ma and Pa, and with the increasing conflict on the street outside their windows.This is a well-told story. The music of the era provides a backdrop, and clips from various movies the family attends add perspective. Jude Hill is a very engaging Buddy, though he seems very young. Caitríona Balfe is excellent as the mother. Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench have remarkable chemistry as the loving grandparents. Some critics think ""Belfast"" is too understated, but I thought the tone was bang on.For me, doing the film in black and white was mistake. It felt like forced ""technique,"" especially with leaving the movie clips in color.",Belfast

The pace of the movie was all one note. I fell asleep twice.The movie had a lot going for it when watching the trailer, but then when watching the actual movie you don't see any of that potential at all. Like I said the best part of this was Jamie I mean he sang and he can't be any worse then he was when he was in the Fifty Shades trilogy, but he still is a terrible actor.Now the little boy I think will have a huge career in his future he definitely can act I just think this was not the right role for him.

1439,12,gcsman,A nuanced labor of love for Kenneth Branagh. Fine movie.,8/10,15 November 2021,"Actor/director Kenneth Branagh produces finely crafted films that cross the bridge between auteur-like subjects presented in a way that has strong popular appeal. 'Belfast', a street-level view of a very ordinary neighborhood in Belfast during The Troubles, is entrancing -- quietly extracting universal themes out of a brief period in the life of one working-class family (Catriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, and their young boys played by Jude Hill and Lewis McAskie; and their grandparents, magnificently played by Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds). It's a totally enjoyable mix of life, humor, character, love, and just a bit of danger. Other movies about this time and place might have chosen to focus on the 'big' themes of the civil war itself and the bloodshed and the upper-level politics and religion. But Belfast is 'small' and yet all the more effective. Branagh brings all of this right down to a personal level where the characters are what's important and the Troubles are mostly just an annoying backdrop.One thing that struck me by the end was the difference between generations. The kids (Buddy, Will, and their friends on the street) simply adjust to everything going on around them as only kids can do, and keep on running around playing street games, going to school, figuring out relationships with older and younger kids. Their parents have the major issues to cope with: pay the bills, keep their family together, but where? The father already commutes every week to a builder's job in England, and has an offer in hand to move there permanently for a better salary and housing. Should they uproot themselves for greener pastures but where they will be strangers? The mother is frankly scared to. Finally, the grandparents are free to simply be supportive. They're not going anywhere and happily look after the boys when necessary while passing on their wonderfully phrased homespun philosophy about life and love and nature. (Wait till you hear Pa's unique advice to Buddy about handling math tests and assignments.)The film is in classic black and white. Branagh has used this before (In the Bleak Midwinter, 1995 -- another 'small' film with a very similar feel). It's quite easy to get used to. And it's brilliant for one thing that he obviously wanted to do, which is to focus in sharply on the details of every scene. This culminates in the very last scene where the grandmother (Dench, with a marvellously lined face and penetrating eyes filling the screen) quietly says-- to the parents but out of their hearing -- 'Leave. Leave now. Don't look back.'This movie grew steadily on me as it went. It's Irish to the core, but it's universal. Tell a big story by making it particular.",Belfast
1440,13,PotassiumMan,"Slice of life, full of character- and tears",9/10,14 November 2021,"Kenneth Branagh's film offers a glimpse into his childhood in Belfast in the late 1960s when the city was being torn apart by sectarian violence. The narrative shifts from joy and wonder to fear and uncertainty with shocking smoothness.The story is told from the perspective of a young boy, who tries to make the most of his dodgy surroundings. His school, his strict Protestant church and his family all shape his identity. Meanwhile, his parents have a tenuous hold on their home and financial situation, primarily due to the father's long history of dodging tax obligations. The mother struggles to raise her boys in a safe and stable environment, especially as she mostly is left alone with the kids due to her husband working in England. The boy's grandparents are often his closest friends much of the time as their wisdom offers him comfort.This film covers it all, a realistic and honest reflection of the instability of Belfast's neighborhoods as well as the personal challenges of dealing with uncertainty and the dwelling question of leaving or staying in one's native environment. The conclusion is impeccable and left me choking up, a feeling that lingers on as I still ponder it. With an perfectly selected Van Morrison soundtrack, this one's a winner. Highly, highly recommended.",Belfast
1441,14,bastille-852-731547,Branagh's ode to Northern Ireland is inoffensive yet deeply generic,5/10,11 November 2021,"Kenneth Branagh has been a strong talent both writing and starring in various films over the years, so one could at least hope that his semi-autobiographical depiction of a child growing up in Belfast during The Troubles would be a strong work. Unfortunately, this black-and-white film is lacking in plot, character development, and emotional depth. The autobiographical elements and black-and-white cinematography have some similarity with Alfonso Cuarón's ""Roma,"" but that film's unique explorations of interpersonal relationships and social inequities are far more profound than anything on display here.Set in Belfast in 1969, the film primarily centers around Buddy, a young boy growing up during this extremely difficult time. He's working on a major project in school about the moon landing, while also beginning to contemplate his future and hopes for life with increasing ambition for a child his age. While the film opens a variety of plot threads (Buddy's school project, the violence and tension of The Troubles, the differences between Buddy's parents, the deteriorating health of Buddy's grandfather,) many of them are not resolved in interesting or memorable ways. The film offers surprisingly little commentary or deeper analysis of the sectarian violence of the time and the ways it caused significant social damage. In fact, the depictions of rioting and looting in the film look more stylized than genuinely believable. Jude Hill does a good job playing Buddy for his age, and manages to convey both a genuine childlike innocence as well as unequivocal sense of sweetness. Yet the film provides minimal character development, and none of the characters are especially memorable. The emotional stakes in the film are often muted as well. Given the minimal attempts at creating an engaging and impactful story, providing clear commentary or analysis on the time period, or developing characters, ""Belfast""'s screenplay is ultimately a real disappointment. The film does have some good cinematography in black-and-white, with some aesthetically striking shots of the port of Belfast. Van Morrison's music can complement the film in some scenes, but it also can come across as inappropriate relative to the context of the scene at other moments. Ultimately, the film ends up being a disappointment even though it clearly comes off as well-meaning. 5/10.",Belfast
1442,15,chong_an,"""They can't understand what we're saying""",6/10,27 November 2021,"When faced with the possibility of emigrating to escape The Troubles in 1969 Belfast, Ma is dubious about people understanding their Irish accent. Which is fitting, as I missed a fair chunk of the dialog because I could not understand the accent, and did not have the ability (for streamed movies) of turning on the closed captioning.Another problem I had was confusion of the minor characters. I wish the screenplay was more Shakespearean, where the characters frequently greeted each other by name, which would have clarified who was who.That said, this is a reasonable take on a 9-year-old boy living through the start of The Troubles. Living in a Protestant street in a mixed neighbourhood, the film starts with a ""Crystal day"", with a Catholic mob's attack, breaking windows and torching cars. Even as he is frightened and bewildered by the violence, and the subsequent brief appearance of troops to guard the street, he is emotionally against leaving what is familiar, including his friends and extended family.A news item gives a hint of the origins of the conflict. High unemployment in Northern Ireland has Pa being frequently absent as he finds work elsewhere, but also suggests that the fight is over the scraps people are competing for in a bad economy.The feeling of being in a ghetto is heightened by the repeated scene of the kids squeezing through an opening of bent railings to go to school. The atmospherics are right, but it is unfortunate I missed a lot of the dialog.",Belfast

The young lead holds his own working opposite some of the greatest talents alive today. The look of BELFAST is excellent and reflects the work of a master craftsman at work. Filled with many scenes that are charming, poignant, or funny; some audiences will have a great time watching BELFAST. However, the story is so specific to its time that it will be difficult for many audiences to engage with this film.

A force to be reckoned with. However, Belfast was a bit self-indulgent. Any time an artist makes a film about themself, I roll my eyes and want to lay them across my lap and tell them vanity and insecurity don't make compatible bedfellows. This wasn't an awful film, but it was awfully boring for much of it. No diss intended to GorgeousBranny, but I would've rather sat through ten hours of his family's home reels sipping tea and hurling insults at one another.

1448,21,taylor_king-890-815491,Perfect Ten,10/10,21 November 2021,"If you're as sick of nihilistic movies - full of non-stop computer-generated destruction and loathsome characters - as I am, go see Belfast. Bravo Kenneth Branagh! This is a beautiful film based on his experience growing up in Northern Ireland when civil strife threatened lives and unsettled peaceful co-existence of communities with different beliefs and their relationship with ruling England. While we're familiar with the part the IRA played in Irish history, it's novel to view it through the eyes of a young kid called ""Buddy"", Branagh's alter-ego. I don't always like child actors - too precious and unnatural - but this young kid, who plays Buddy, is so real as he reacts to what's going on in his young life. He's featured among a very talented, largely unknown cast of fellow actors, which makes it all seem more real vs. Another Hollywood production. The exception is the Grandmother, beautifully portrayed by Judi Dench. Shot in black & white, with a 60's music score, and intercuts to memorable TV shows & popular films of the times, Belfast transports us back to another time under its competent writing, direction & acting.

1450,23,stevenduhig,Great acting. Hard to follow for some.,7/10,12 November 2021,"Not a documentary.What I presume to be a very personal, but not fully autographical, viewpoint from Kenneth Brannagh's 8/9 year old childhood in Belfast.It could be a difficult movie to watch if you dont know 1960's Northern Irish history:
The movie starts in 1969 which is already well into ""The Troubles"" from the ""Catholic"" perspective. This start coincides with the arrival of the British Army in Belfast.As such it omits the long period of extreme situations and violence that resulted in that unprecedented government intervention.Although I believe there is truth in the brutishness and frustration of the British Army later on in Northern Ireland, my understanding is that to start with in 1969 they often did not even carry weapons or show much muscle at all.Mostly they simply accompanied the Royal Ulster Constabulary side by side in their duties, but things did deteriorate over time.The movie correctly shows well that the initial violence was mainly against the ""Catholic"" community.This could be confusing for some viewers who do not understand this to be true. It was the Catholic Community, who, under economic and social siege by 1968/9, wanted protection from the ""Protestant"" gangs and predominantly ""Protestant"" police from the British Government back then.A fact overshadowed by subsequent conflicts between the British Army and the IRA.This is why I did not like the opening crushing scene of the Army's arrival. I do not believe they went in like a bull in a china shop initially, like the ""B Specials"" had been doing in The Catholic communites beforehand.The ""Protestant"" community were certainly more hostile to the Army at the beginning though. I believe it was widely believed by the government in Whitehall that the Irish ""protestants"" were the biggest problem at that time.The RUC police, and the tough ""B Specials"" were nearly all ""Protestant"" and prejudiced.I suspect several whole streets, where the communities had co-existed very well, were raised to the ground before the Army's arrival, and the communities did retreat into barracaded areas such as The Shankill, and Falls Road.The film:
Even with a somewhat informed background, and usually being able to distinguish between the two communities different accents, it was not easy to see who belonged to who...
Foreign audiences, perhaps being primed to think of The Troubles from a southern ""Catholic"" point of view may find this film difficult to follow too.Protestant terrorists are rarely portrayed in the media, and never without their IRA counterparts.High praise is due to Kenneth for having the courage to portray The Troubles from a unique non-violent ""Protestant"" family point of view, and for including sympathy for non-violent ""Catholics"" too.It is truly quite remarkable that the IRA did not seem to get a mention at all.Is that a good thing?I am not sure.The result is certainly a very unusual film which portrays a comparitively less violent view of The Troubles, and mostly from one communities dimension only.There is a good story and some superb directing and acting, especially by the youngest actors.The more experienced and famous senior cast are excellent too. The acting stands out in this movie for me. The family, social and community portrayal is awesome. The kids have it. Is there a steeliness missing there for true authenticity. Parents on both sides were heavily abusive of each other and the children in many cases. It was a very hard life still in the 1960s.The home displayed was more middle class for me, with very expensive ""Thunderbird"" sets and ""Subbuteo"" toys. The decoration, fitted carpets and radiogram etc. Would have been scarce. Some very good attention to detail though, such as the TVs, TV news and shows which I mostly liked, and the Matchbox toys (but did I glimpse a modern Oxford Diecast in there too ;-)
The fact that the buses shown, although carefully revamped were exLondon RFs speaks volumes for the absence today of NI vehicles of the period, hundreds of which were destroyed.They were replaced by English provincial cast offs, so no need for London vehicles yet again in a movie. At least one was very well finished though.Liked the focus on Australia and Canada shifting to the more achievable solution of a move to the mainland.Interestingly he did not elaborate on the severe unemployment which was actually nearly entirely '""Catholic"".It was suggested that his father was an employee, but had serious tax debt which would be unlikely under employers PAYE direct deduction.He did subtly suggest that the RUC etc.. had a very, very friendly relationship with fellow Protestant community. They were well known for treating Catholics with much more hostility.Bus to the airport? I doubt if a working class commuter could have afforded to fly in and out of Belfast back then. It would have been a bus to the Holyhead ferry.The presence of a Calvinist Minister at a disco tapping to the music did not sit well with me, and the surrealistic climax of showing a line of RUC on one side of a tiny street with the army on the other side slowly walking towards and past each other, was completely lost on me I'm afraid.I was pleased that Kenneth Branagh made a 90 minute movie. Not too long at all, and yet despite such great acting on all levels and some excellent imagery, including successful use of, even mixed, monochrome, the film still seemed to drag a little.Yet it is too his great credit that he did not allow himself to be sucked into over dramatisation at the conclusion, or at any point in the film.I was left wondering what his aim was. If it was to simply tell a a story of a ""Protestant"" family in Belfast during The Troubles, then he may have succeeded, but sad ""Belfast"" in The Troubles is much more than this single perspective..",Belfast
1451,24,LisaLR1,BELFAST Triumphs as Heartwarming Story of Family Love & Survival in Tumultuous 1969 Northern Ireland,9/10,22 November 2021,"BELFAST triumphs as heartwarming story of family love & survival in tumultuous times of religious strife between Protestants & Catholics in 1969 Northern Ireland. The film is an autobio written & directed by actor Kenneth Branagh based on his own early childhood in Belfast. The movie is told from the point-of-view of 9 year old Buddy, played by newcomer Jude Hill, whose luminous performance & angelic face steals the film. Equally excellent are his Pa & Ma, actors Jamie Dornan & Caitríona Balfe & his grandparents, the exquisite Dame Judi Dench & the marvelous Ciarán Hinds. Through Buddy, the audience watches as the family manages to survive their Belfast neighborhood through religious clashes & violence, their own financial struggles, ultimately leading them to move to London & start a new life. BELFAST is beautifully shot, primarily in black-and-white, by long-time Branagh collaborator, cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, featuring strong production design by Jim Clay.

1452,25,parksiet,Branagh's best work! A beautiful and deeply personal film',10/10,14 November 2021,"Belfast is an absolutely gorgeous movie, and easily one of the best films of the year! It's pure, honest, very human and all around very wholesome and lovely. I honestly never expected a film this remarkable to come from Kenneth Branagh but wow is this ever such an incredible piece of work; easily his best! And if this doesn't come close to winning best picture I will be very upset, as it's truly an excellent and heartfelt film that is one of the best I've seen all year!It's Branagh's most personal film, and I think that's what makes it such a triumph. The writing and directing from Branagh is the highlight, it's some of the most special and poignant parts of the entire film. He makes some truly bold directorial choices, and the film itself is very clever, extremely charming and at the same time has a center of humour to it all! What it does best is put the audience in the shoes of the family it focuses on, specifically the youngest son, Buddy, who I assume is the film's version of Branagh himself. The autobiographical elements help the movie to feel very authentic and real, it helps connect us to the movie as Branagh's recollection of experiences being back memories of our own similar childhood experiences. Which brings me to my next point, Branagh wisely tells the story as if it's glimpses into childhood memories; stolen moments and eavesdropped conversations, which gives it such a special feeling. It's clearly deeply personal for Branagh and makes it that much more impactful. One thing that really stuck out to me is the sequences set inside a theatre, with the characters either watching a play or a movie. While the rest of the movie is in black and white, the movie screen and the actors on stage in the play are shown in colour, highlighting the way that cinema and the theatre served as inspirations for Branagh and were special to Buddy in the movie. These sequences also payed a nice homage to Cinema Paradiso, which I really appreciated! The movie itself reminds us why movies are so important and how they bring people together through the character of Buddy.I loved Jude Hill as Buddy in the movie, he outshone everyone else in the cast with his fantastic performance, and delivered one of the finest performances from a child actor I've ever seen. He was charming and funny, and helped to show a perspective of childlike wonder to the audience, whether about Belfast itself or the movies. I also loved both Caitríona Balfe and Jamie Dornan as Ma and Pa, they are truly excellent and emotionally root the film! Honestly all the performances in this movie blew me away, it's a fantastic cast and they really delivered.The film is an ode to family. It focuses on the mundane challenges of life and maintaining family, and the greater social unrest that is challenging their lives. The struggles of debt, health, religion, work, raising children and dealing with change are all wonderfully touched on throughout the film, and I love how it still touched in the riots and civil unrest in Ireland in the late 60s between Catholics and Protestants. It's a piece of history not many know about and Branagh excellently shows effects these events could have on a family. I loved the long takes he employed, especially the one at the opening of the film that follows Buddy through the streets culminating in a 720-degree pan as we see the terror in his face seeing the oncoming riot. It was a completely gripping opening and gave us a sense of what was to come. The cinematography is exceptional and uses colour so interestingly. I love that Branagh lets the camera linger in scenes, allowing for the actors to command the scene. He also uses focus and framing just perfectly. Honestly, the technical elements in this film are damn near perfect, it's nearly flawless. It did take me a while to get into the film, but once I did I loved it. I also loved the use of Van Morrison for the soundtrack!Belfast is truly a cinematic treat. Movies like this remind me why I love film, and it was just such a gorgeous and heartfelt, deeply personal film from Branagh. It's what makes it his masterpiece, and easily one of the best films this year. It would be a crime if this wasn't nominated for best picture, and the film deserves all the praise it has gotten so far! It's truly something special, a must see, and I really loved it!",Belfast

1454,27,Kit-Angel,All you need is Love.,10/10,5 November 2021,What a wonderful film full of heart and love .Yes it's dark in places although is that made even more so as we the viewer know what is to come? It depicts the start of the violence that claimed over 3000 lives in what became known as the troubles. The troubles doesn't sound like much for a 30 year period that claimed so many lives and damaged physically and mentally many tens of thousands of others me included. I expect many will consider this a little sentimental and even superficial. To me it's clearly not made as a history of those early days but rather how a normal working class everyday family tries to adapt to change all around then. The change isn't just politics but social attitudes as well. The slow realisation that life can't carry on as before but is the sacrifice for a different life which might or might not be better worth it? Nostalgia often gets a bad reputation in films but what is nostalgia? In its purest form it's just an act of remembrance of past events. So yes this film one could say is nostalgic and for me it's all the better for being so. When the Guardian review was so poor I knew I would love it and I did.,Belfast
1455,28,Jackthemovielover,Entertaining trip through history,9/10,27 November 2021,"A very entertaining film with very few flaws. Nostalgic trip through the later 1960's period in Belfast, complete with cultural references, e.g. Star Trek, and many nostalgic props/antiques. Portrays the Troubles through the eyes of one family and one boy. Succeeds in linking the very personal to the community and the country. Portrays the violence of the civil war in a realistic, yet restrained way. Also does well in handling romance at different ages and disagreements between spouses. Filmed almost all in black and white, which seems like the right choice. Could be a tad bit watered down from harsh reality in a Disney way, but still retains enough accuracy to be credible. The boy playing the child hero did a wonderful job and should have a future in film if he keeps working. Should be interesting to anyone interested in Ireland, England, or childhood in a close community. Only major flaw was that some of the speech was not intelligible to this US reviewer. Probably due to a combination of poor acoustics in the theater and the Irish dialect spoken rapidly. Perhaps better editing of the voice tracks and more careful diction could have cured this problem. Otherwise, a fine creation of the artistic and technical team. Earned every dollar I spent to see it. If you see this, choose a theater that has very good acoustics and sound system.",Belfast

Of course you wouldn't even know that colonialism was the issue causing the violence in this film if you didn't already have an awareness. It's a pretty pastiche of nostalgia & Irish stories that were told better so skip it & go straight to reading Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha. Mustache twirling 2 dimensional villains, apolitical to the point of being willfully misleading, devoid of any real substance this film is a pretty collection of music videos and it never really lands any earned emotionality despite its very strong cast. Brannagh's writing and directing flops hard and no amount of beautiful cinematography can make this a good film. A Norman Rockwell without any of the subversive subtext of Rockwell's art. I'm sure it'll get Oscar buzz as it takes a challenging subject and makes it an unchallenging crowd pleaser film but that makes it all the more disappointing.

1459,32,joebnow,"Lovely, heartfelt film",9/10,30 October 2021,"Not a perfect film, but a darn good one. Easily touches the heart. The cast is stellar. Ken Branagh loves faces and gives his cast closeups that tell the story without the use of much dialogue. See Judi Dench for what I mean. However, the star is the young Jude Hill playing Buddy. The performance is perfection. If anyone doesn't love this character by the end of the film, he has no heart. But Dornan, Hinds, and Balfe are all terrific. My quibbles come with the film's political bent. Not sure why the leader of the Protestant rebels feels Pa is essential to their cause. And understanding this seems essential to the family's decision. I could have missed something early in the film because it took these ears a while to adjust to the Irish accents. However, other than that -and some heavy handed foreshadowing- it's a lovely, wonderful film.

Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful.A heartwarming memory piece from one of our finest living filmmakers. Seeing this movie with a big audience was such a joyous occasion, and hearing Van Morrison's compositions pour throughout the theatre just filled me with such plain and simple happiness. The black & white photography is so easy to get lost in, perfectly capturing the mood of 60s Belfast. Each and every performance is perfectly tuned into the material; Jamie Dornan & Catriona Balfe alone make this film worth watching. Whenever this gets a wide release gather the whole family, you'll laugh a lot, then cry, then laugh some more. I just had a great time, and sometimes that's all I really need out of a movie.

1462,35,jessicad24,Memorable,10/10,15 November 2021,"Best movie I've watched this year. Saw it two days ago and I'm still thinking about it. The young actor Jude Hill does a great job as the lead. In this, his first film role, he holds his own easily. I got a good laugh out of his delivery in the church scene, particularly as the character gives his donation! All of the adult actors were great as well but Caitriona Balfe's performance in particular was wonderful. It's easy to see why people are talking about her possibly being nominated for an Oscar. Living in Canada, I was not really familiar with the Troubles before, but this film has motivated me to learn. I have always had an interest in the history of this part of the world (United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland) anyway. But this film struck a chord with me in terms of how it shows the effects of this tumultuous time on everyday people. The fact that it is shown through the eyes of a child was another reason why this film interested me so much and why I love it. I love ""Jojo Rabbit"" for the same reason -- these films take harrowing parts of history and show how children and families were impacted. That is the aspect of history that I am interested in the most. Definitely looking forward to seeing this again.",Belfast
1463,36,amandatyke,LOVE AT FIRST SCENE,10/10,15 November 2021,"There is not enough words I could say or use to describe how much I loved, Belfast. From the moment the movie starts it draws you in. It captures your heart and leaves you entranced. The plot, which is told through the eyes of a child plays with your emotions. Belfast will have you laughing one moment, to crying the next. Then having you feel empathy towards those who really experienced those issues during that time. The director's decision to show the film in black and white adds a nice aesthetic as the story is unfolding. It makes you feel like you went on a journey back in time, like you were right there experiencing it all with Pa, Ma, Will, Buddy, Granny and Pop. The music chosen for the soundtrack adds a nice tie in to the film. No doubt, the best was Everlasting Love which was performed by no other than Pa portrayed by the phenomenal actor Jamie Dornan. Jamie was outstanding and out of all the characters, his character Pa will tug at your heartstrings the most because the sacrifices he had to make for the welfare of his family. Jamie nailed the portrayal of an anguished man, missing and worrying about his family. Granny who was portrayed by Judi Dench will also tug at your heart with all she lost, yet she continued to put her head up and moved forward one step at a time like the brave women she was. Caitriona Balfe as Ma also had you feeling for her. You could feel her fears and hesitations come to life as you watched her struggle with situations unfolding around her all the while still trying to teach her children right from wrong. Buddy, played by Jude Hall who's eyes the story is told through does a fantastic job making the audience feel and see the events told through a child's eye. Ciaran Hinds as Pop was the glue that held them together. He made you wish you had a Pop like him. The lesson and beautiful meaning of the story was delivered by Pop (Ciaran Hinds) and Pa (Jamie Dornan). This movie is about a family who lived in anguish, went through struggles and loss, but was held together by love and kindness. Watching this movie with change you. It makes you have empathy especially for those of Northern Ireland and all they went through. I highly recommend this film.",Belfast
1464,37,robyn-09230,Another wonderful Branagh film!,8/10,13 November 2021,"I look forward to everything Kenneth Branagh does as an actor, director, writer, etc. His range is on par with the greatest directors ever. However, Belfast is in a league of its own. There is a personal intimacy to the story without it resorting into clichés. Too often mother characters are made out to be shrews while the father characters are made out to be distant and uncaring. In Belfast, the characters are flawed as all human beings are without going over the top. There is conflict within the family without it being overplayed while they struggle with the discord going on around them.There is a gritty authenticity to Belfast. Yes, there is violence . . . But, it has been dosed out in a quantity to help the viewer attenuate to what was going on and not eat up the minutes with bits and bites of storyline thrown in for effect.Belfast is well cast and Jude Hill as Buddy is wonderful. This movie isn't intended to explain the Catholic-Protestant conflict as much as it focuses on the impact to a family and small community.Belfast is subtle storytelling without resorting to so many things films rely on (e.g., CGI, sex, violence, etc.) to keep the audience entertained. Many will not applaud the restraint Branagh demonstrates. It's a movie for a cerebral audience that can appreciate storytelling without special effects or gratuitous trappings.",Belfast
1465,38,dpmccandless,Beautiful story,9/10,18 November 2021,"Slow-moving in parts, but makes up for it with a string of scenes that stir your emotions. Can't say enough about the acting: Catrion Balfe (Ma) and Jamie Dornan (Pa) show the roller coaster ride of a struggling marriage, all unfolding before the eyes of their young son.Set in Belfast during the Troubles, but that's only a backdrop. It's really about a family struggling to stay together.

Went to the same primary school, but we never knew one another. Ran in a local gang, only once nicking a choccie bar from the local supermarket as a dare, and always every Friday night running out the back with me ma from the rent man. My da was away more than he was with us. I now have a better perspective of what my ma went through raising four kids. This film is amazing, true to memory, and caused me to (in Ken's words in a Toronto interview) 'choke' many, many times. I cried, I laughed, and I held my breath. More than a movie to me. True to the movie our da took us across to England where he found work, but that was a terrible experience definitely for me a 9 year old. Nearly a year surrounded by kids and adults who just didn't like us. We came back quick. But, whilst the Troubles in the beginning were truly shocking, we got used to them, which was terrible in itself. We left for Australia in 73. As I said, more than a movie to me, it brought me great joy and amazingly many long-forgotten memories flooded back. Massive thank you to Ken for making this all happen, and to am amazing local cast who I still understood (the accent and the slang) despite being out here for more than 50 years.",Belfast

But above all, despite the fact that his Billy is not exactly lovable (that's an understatement), Colin Morgan.A completely different role to his previous performances.With each of his scenes the whole room held its breath.We also felt threatened.It is a pity that not much is said about him, often his presence is not even mentioned, even though he plays a fundamental role in the plot.The Troubles are treated marginally, after all they are a child's memories, but with a little more space perhaps the film would have benefited.I would have liked to go for a 10 but that bothered me.",Belfast

It is very disjointed. The movie is based upon a very somber history of the religious battles in Belfast. However it tries very hard to be funny, but in my opinion did not succeed. The Irish accents were very difficult to understand.

As if ""Moonrise Kingdom"" woke up in the middle of civil war but everyone still remembered to be cute.Some nice black and white images but Branaugh bugs me as a director, nary an overlapped word of dialogue, not one spontaneous movement. Peach-faced children choreographed and hitting marks as they play, every friendly passerby walking on unobstructed cue. Then toss in Van Morrison music ladled from start to finish and all that is missing is a sweet emoji. (Don't get me started on the almost 'Lobster'esque pop number near the end, apparently meant to cheer up the poverty. Bombs? Religious division? Relocating whole lives? No problem. Everyone dance!)Frankly, I'd rather just put on Simple Minds' ""Belfast Child"" but I know I will be plagued by this one for all of Oscar season, no doubt. Even the poster with its ""Belfest Belly Elliot"" Fun-In-Wartime ad campaign makes me queasy. And makes me miss Jim Sheridan big time.P. S. May I propose a drinking game once this goes to streaming?

1478,51,les_carroll,Entertaining movie,10/10,26 November 2021,"Good movie with lots of aspects to it - funny moments, good music, sad moments. Good acting especially from the little boy - he was amazing!!I was really excited to see this movie before it's main release and left thinking about it for a while after switching from laughing to crying.Many of us have ancestors who had to leave their home country for various reasons, whether it was Ireland or other places that people leave to give their family a better life and that's what the movie is about.I don't think people should bring Northern Ireland politics into this movie or argue facts about the troubles when reviewing. Take it as an entertaining movie about a family facing tough decisions and the producers memories of his family at that time.

1479,52,yodajuanfermi,Very Impressive!,8/10,13 November 2021,"This is not your typical movie. It's one of those rare flicks that's more about the journey than the destination. It's set in Belfast in '69, when all hell began breaking loose between two religious factions, but it's not so much about that event. It's about a typical, imperfect family and how they react to an unexpected, rapidly evolving situation that threatens their way of life. The cast is awesome, and the story is well-told. The cinematography is exceptional. It's not really my kind of movie, but I loved it anyway.

1480,0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable fluff...very enjoyable fluff!,8/10,20 December 2011,"""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!",Elf
1481,1,TheLittleSongbird,"Sweet and charming, salvaged by the cast",7/10,31 December 2010,"Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox

1482,2,SnoopyStyle,childlike Ferrell fun,8/10,30 November 2013,"Orphan Buddy (Will Ferrell) sneaks in Santa (Edward Asner)'s bag and ends up in the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises Buddy as an elf. His giantness causes all kinds of problems. Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) who is actually on Santa's naughty list. He gets a job at a store and befriends fellow worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).Childlike Will Ferrell is giving off so much joy and innocence. He is so silly that it is impossible to not laugh at his slapstick humor. He fully commits and that's what makes it so hilarious. The only minor difficulty lies with James Caan. His personality is way too intense for a wacky comedy. But it picks up whenever he reunites with sweetheart Zooey Deschanel. And he has good fun with his brother Michael. Jon Favreau has created a wacky comedy with a heart.

1483,3,Prismark10,Elf and safety,6/10,4 January 2014,Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kind of film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in the North Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much taller than the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his real father once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynical James Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks he is an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department store while trying to connect with his father. He also helps the real Santa by getting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults may find it a little bit over the top.Ferrell has enough charm to pull off the role. James Caan on the other hand has found a new generation of fans who know him as Walter and not Sonny Corleone.,Elf
1484,4,mark.waltz,There's magic in the man in green.,10/10,21 December 2020,"The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.Stepmom Mary Steenburgen (along with Dianne Wiest and Sissy Spacek the perfect on-screen mom) immediately takes to him, half brother Daniel Tay finds a playmate and world weary Zooey Deschanel goes from wanting to kill him on their first meeting to completely entranced by his sweetness. Caan must find the kid in himself to from the Scrooge like publisher to a loving husband and father, and that will take a Christmas miracle.Having not seen this until now, I felt like a complete freeze miser for unintentionally missing it, although I did see the musical on Broadway in 2012. This film pays great tribute to our modern Christmas culture with references to the Franken-Bass TV specials of my childhood and even gets a very funny Keebler elf reference in as well. Who better to play Santa than Ed Asner? He's completely loveable with absolutely no Lou Grant gruffness.One of the funniest gags is the reemergence of the long defunct Gimbles department store where Buddy meets Deschanel and turns the Santa village upside down by redecorating it overnight. When he surprises her in the employee lounge (complete with shower) as she sings ""Baby It's Cold Outside"", it's a magical moment, one of many that starts with the sight of Santa's real village.Everybody is absolutely perfect here, not a false note in the film. So old fashioned in theme but very modern in spirit, this never falters in any way. The ensemble seems to have been magically delicious in loving the script because they are all filled with joy even when acting grumpy like veteran little actor Peter Dinklage, playing one of Caan's prestigious clients whom Ferrell accidentally insults. Putting my own big city cynicism away for the evening, this made me feel like Scrooge the morning after all of his nightmares when the spirit of Christmas returned to him. At times, this can even bring on a tear of joy.",Elf
1485,5,kosmasp,Big Elf,9/10,2 December 2020,"I guess size matters ... well that is body size. But how can a strange movie like this even be so fun to watch? I think it is a combination. You get Jon Favreau as a director who has proven since then what he is capable of behind the camera (we knew he is a great actor) and this amazing assemble of wonderful people in front of the camera. It is silly and if Will Ferrell knows to do one thing, it is being silly and likeable.Mission accomplished ... but also James Caan, Zoey Deschanel and so many others. It really has a heart of gold, even if you may not see it at first or think it isn't there to begin with. Best watched at Christmas time or around that time and with a younger one. I did watch it with my nephew. Great fun all around.

1486,6,classicsoncall,"""It's just nice to meet anyone human who shares my affinity for elf culture.""",7/10,7 July 2020,"In a concession to my eleven year old granddaughter, I watched ""Elf"" yesterday with her. Quite honestly, I thought she was suggesting ""Alf"" to me, so when she pulled it up on Netflix I managed an inward groan to myself. The end result though, was that I came away pleasantly entertained by the naive innocence of the Elf character Buddy, disarmingly portrayed by Will Ferrell. I don't usually go for pictures starring former SNL comedians because they're usually mindless fluff, but this one had a way of holding your attention to see what silliness comes next. I got a kick out of the sight gags and Buddy's one-sided view of a world he had no knowledge of once he hit New York City on a mission to find his real father. The script writers apparently weren't too concerned about him finding his real mother, a thought that occurred to me throughout, especially with each time that photo of a young Walter Hobbs (James Caan) was shown with his one time girlfriend. But that quickly gets lost in the shuffle of Buddy's precarious encounters with the staff at Gimbel's and Santa's (Ed Asner) arrival fueled by the Christmas Spirit provided by all of Buddy's new found friends and family. I can't really claim that this will wind up a holiday staple with me, but for a one time experience, ""Elf"" will bring a smile. Because in the words of Buddy himself - ""I like to smile. Smiling's my favorite""!",Elf
1487,7,gavin6942,Not Ferrell's Worst Film,6/10,20 November 2011,"After inadvertently wreaking havoc on the elf community due to his ungainly size, a man raised as an elf at the North Pole (Will Ferrell) is sent to New York in search of his true identity.I am really hit and miss with Will Ferrell. I really enjoy some of his work (especially ""Anchorman"") while other things he does are just too silly and juvenile. This falls somewhere in the middle.Hipsters are happy to see Zooey Deschanel in this movie. I am more concerned with why she and Will Ferrell are matched up. If it is not strange enough that she would fall for a seemingly psychotic homeless man, there is a thirteen year age difference. That is just slightly creepy (though not really unheard of).After multiple viewings, I can see how the film is charming in its own way and there are even some subtle nods to Ray Harryhausen and Peter Billingsley. Any film that pays homage to these two has to be worth something.",Elf
1488,8,jboothmillard,Elf,6/10,9 December 2007,"You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in fact it it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story is told by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son. Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and a baby managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get a toy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, he named Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as if he was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy (Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him a photo he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who deals with book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. So Buddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discovers all the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does not believe he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again, Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful love interest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad, Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter does eventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, and giving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causes chaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children's book writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf. Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashes in the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmas spirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singing along with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter. The highlights for me are all of Ferrell, but more especially the snowball fight and the large burp after drinking a whole bottle of Coca Cola in seconds. Good!",Elf
1489,9,BA_Harrison,"It's OK, but I'd rather watch Scrooged.",6/10,27 December 2009,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichés in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.",Elf
1490,10,moonspinner55,A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...,7/10,23 December 2007,"Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****

1491,11,Quinoa1984,"Not a bad Christmas comedy at all, though nothing great",7/10,25 December 2003,"Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family.  This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit.  Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role).  Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole.  Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year.  He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy.  Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too.  Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store).  Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all.  A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+",Elf

He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids ""from 1 to 92""!

The outcome of which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders the finale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting cast also suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination.

Visually, ""Elf"" is a delightful little movie with interesting characters. The North Pole set and the costumes that the elves wear are colorful.""Elf"" concerns an infant up for adoption at an orphanage who crawls into Santa Claus' gift bag during Christmas and winds up at the North Pole. As it turns out, he is raised as one of the elves, specifically Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as the narrator. At six feet, three inches, Buddy (Will Ferrell) cannot do anything right as an elf. Ironically, Buddy has no idea that he isn't an elf. The revelation that he is not an elf staggers him. One day he is shown a picture of his mother and father. Tragically, Buddy's mother died without informing his father Walter Hobbs (James Caan of ""The Godfather"") that he had sired him. Buddy sets out from the North Pole and walks on foot to Manhattan where he finally comes face-to-face with Walter. Walter is married, has a teenage son, and works at a book publishing firm. Reluctantly, Walter takes Buddy into his house and disasters galore ensue. Briefly, Buddy holds a job at Gimbels' Department Store in the toy department. When he assaults a man masquerading as Santa Claus, Buddy lands in jail and Walter bails him out. Eventually, after exasperating Walter continually with his adolescent antics, Buddy leaves and is standing on a bridge surveying the river when Santa Claus (Ed Asner) streaks overhead in his sleight with his reindeer. Something goes wrong and Santa has to crash land. Naturally, Buddy heads to his rescue.Light, frivolous nonsense from start to finish, ""Elf"" qualifies as scintillating comedy with Ferrell having a field day as the tallest elf on record. This is Ferrell at his finest in an emerald jacket and golden tights. Mind you, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian is an acquired taste. He behaves like an imbecile and he stoops to conqueror with lowest common denominator humor. James Caan is appropriately harried as his selfish father, and Oscar winning actress Mary Steenburgen plays Walter's wife Emily, while Zooey Deschanel is cast as Jovie, Buddy's love interest. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage appears in an amusing small part as a children's book writer.",Elf

Even though it is rather obvious that he is a LOT bigger than every other elf, he goes on believing it until the elf he referred to as ""dad"" broke it to him that he wasn't an elf. So began Buddy's journey out of the North Pole and to New York to find his real dad.Like I said, a lot of the movie was just corny, but I'll be darned if that guy Will Ferrell isn't a riot. Will Ferrell makes the ridiculous work, he was the perfect cast for the role. I just know that the movie doesn't have the same lustre or appeal with someone else in the role of Buddy. There was hardly a scene that Buddy was in that wasn't funny. And I would watch the entire movie again just to hear him say, ""He's an angry elf,"" when referring to an irate midget. Priceless.

1499,19,evanston_dad,A Modern Holiday Classic,7/10,12 December 2006,"Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).""Elf"" is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and root for the Grinch.Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: ""This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me.""

1500,20,ferguson-6,"Christmas, baby, Christmas",8/10,9 November 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Jon Favreau (the greatness of ""Swingers"", also the doctor in ""Elf"") provides the seasons first touch of holiday spirit.  Will Ferrell is perfect as the wanna-be/thought-I-was six foot three elf.  This film works because it has a nice little story (actually a couple of them) that provide the framework for some classic comedy scenes.  The VERY attractive and talented Zooey Deschanel (""the Good Girl"" ""Mumford"") is very good as Buddy's co-worker and friend.  I am looking forward to seeing just how good of an actress she will become.  She has the look to play a love interest or the bad guy/girl role.  A wonderful supporting cast helps make this one work.  James Caan as the Scrooge character and Ed Asner as Santa are both perfect, as is Bob Newhart as Ferrell's adopted elf father.  The key role of Caan's son/Ferrell's brother Michael is played well by Daniel Tay (played Harvey Pekar as a kid in one of this year's best films ""American Splendor"").  Also nice to see Peter Dinklage (from another of this year's best films ""The Station Agent"") in a bizarre, yet brief role as an angry, children's writer for hire.  This is definitely one you can take the whole family to.  There were kids in the audience from ages 2 to 80.  Go with the Christmas spirit, as this is not Shakespeare!",Elf
1501,21,morrison-dylan-fan,A Christmas Buddy.,6/10,26 December 2010,"With Christmas just having finished,I've decided to take a little bit of a break from watching two of my favourite Christmas films (Bob Clarks definitive Xmas film-A Christmas Story and the surprisingly strong Muppets Christmas Carol.)and to try out something that I had been looking forward to seeing for the last few weeks.With a surprisingly strong cast,a charming screenplay and a huge dollop of charm,the movie is something that can easily keep kids and adults very entertained over the holiday period.View on the film:Although the scenes where Will Ferrall is stuffing his face full of sweets are cringe (and not in the way that the film makers were hoping for)due to how forced the joke felt,surprisingly,Ferrall makes Buddy stand out from all of his other characters,by removing any sense that Buddy has a inflated-ego.and replacing it with a very natural sweet (though not sugar-coated) personality.Ferrall is given huge support,by a shining performance from Zooey Deschanel as the wonderfully punk style Jovie.Deschanel impressively shows Jovie going from being very agitated,to finding Buddy completely irresistible in a very enjoyable way.Whilst the screenplay by David Berenbaum,could be seen as a very broad up date of A Christmas Carol (with Buddys dad having to learn the true meaning of Christmas)Berenbaum thankfully,gives most of the traditional Xmas set pieces for films,a fun modern trust (such as having the elves make modern plastic toys.)Smartly Berenbaum makes sure that the story is always the heart of the film,and the audience are always following Buddy,and hoping to see his dad accept him for what he is...Final view on the film:A great film for the whole fame,with a stunning cast and a heart-warming story.",Elf

Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds that fable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedy taking the elf theme to new heights. Score: 9 ½ / 10",Elf

When Walter's relationship with Buddy interferes with his job, he is forced to reevaluate his priorities......Elf isn't as clever as it thinks it is, but it shouldn't be this good either.Ferrall has never been better as the titular character, and it's due to his child like prowess and body language. It's a shame he's never really hit this high in a long time, as he is really likable in this, and makes this movie a little more magical.The rest of the cast are fine, but this is Ferralls movie all over the shop, and there is hardly a scene where he's not in it.It gets a little soppy at the end, but it's a Christmas movie, so all is forgiven.Funny and touching, if a little too blunt with its message.",Elf

After growing up as an elf, he travels to New York City to meet his father (James Caan) and starts a relationship with his neglected younger half-brother. He also starts a relationship with a department store worker (Zooey Deschanel) and helps spread Christmas cheer as Santa (Ed Asner) arrives to the city.This is an all-around entertaining Christmas flick highlighted by Farrell's goofiness as the quasi-elf. It's fun with consistent laughs, not to mention a nice Christmas moral.The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in New York City and Vancouver.GRADE: B+",Elf
1505,25,zetes,"Ferrell tries his best, but the writing is unambitious and mediocre",5/10,8 November 2003,"So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10.",Elf
1506,26,Sylviastel,Great Family movie for people of all religions!,10/10,6 December 2003,"Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film. The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film. There is rarely expletives or violence in the film. Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching, this is it. I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show. He is an untapped comic genius in his own right. Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems. Will Ferrell is worthy of the success. He is brilliant, likable as Buddy. How can you not love him after seeing him in this film? If you're a fan of SNL, you will know why there are volumes of his best work. He is simply incredible comedic genius and we love him at our house.

1508,28,SimonJack,Modern Christmas fairy tale has some good laughs,7/10,8 December 2016,"This film has a very good cast with some big names of the time and past in entertainment. ""Elf"" is a modern Christmas fairy tale that scores well just for its comedy. Somewhere amid the crazy antics and situations there is a Christmas message or two. But this film is something to enjoy just for the laughs. Most of the humor comes from an overgrown elf trying to adapt and learn how to live in an adult world. Along the way, he spreads some Christmas joy. Will Ferrell is Buddy – an overgrown elf by mistake, whose doings resemble the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Merwin's magic. It's hard to imagine anyone else giving the performance Ferrell gives here. The role seems written for him. Bob Newhart is Papa Elf. I don't know any other comedian who could get people to laugh so much with a straight face. He applies his trademark as well in ""Elf."" Edward Asner is Santa Claus, and James Caan is Buddy's real father, Walter. A host of younger actors do very well in their supporting roles. This is a fun movie that most should enjoy for the silliness and laughter.",Elf
1509,29,Mr-Fusion,Admirable family film,7/10,19 December 2015,"I never gave ""Elf"" much consideration, and it's not ""A Christmas Story"" levels of classic, but there's a lot to be said for Will Ferrell in elf booties roaming wide-eyed the streets of New York City. I guess the movie hinges on that central arrested development innocence vs. modern-day yuletide cynicism, but that ain't a bad thing. Favreau squeezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces and the guy really is an endearing spaz. I like the cast, Peter Dinklage is a great easter egg (for lack of a better phrase) and it's just the right dosage of holiday warmth. Sweet, but not stifling.7/10

1510,30,StevePulaski,A rarity for the holidays and for Ferrell,8/10,18 December 2011,"Elf has the premise and the look of a badly made Christmas special made solely for network TV. Going into this with mediocre expectations, it only took about ten minutes of seeing Will Ferrell in an elf costume to know that my predictions were dreadfully wrong. This wasn't a case of holiday dreck, but a case of the Christmas film that combined heart, soul, wit, and laughs into a beautiful holiday parable.The story is about Buddy the Elf (Ferrell) who accidentally crawled into Santa's sack at the orphanage when he was an infant and gets taken back to the North Pole. Santa Claus and the elves choose to raise him and train him to become an elf. Buddy is of course a human so he grows a lot faster than the average elf. In fact, he towers over every other elf he works with, and this leads to problems when he is older.Buddy then learns he is a human, which causes confusion and sadness. It is told that he was placed in that orphanage as an infant because his father fell in love with a woman who gave birth to him then gave him up unbeknownst to him. Buddy then decides he will go to New York City to try and find his dad and reconnect with him.His goal is to also spread Christmas cheer far and wide because Santa's sleigh is almost forced to operate with an engine. In the olden days, Santa's sleigh could fly because of mass amounts of Christmas spirit and children believing in Santa Claus. Now, he has to resort to heavy machinery to do that job.Will Ferrell hasn't sat right with me for the longest time, but as I see more of his movies I begin to like the guy in a sense where I'd like to see him do one of two movies; (a) heartfelt children's' films or (2) very serious dramas in the vein of his 2011 film Everything Must Go. He doesn't have the talents to pull off incredibly funny slapstick because his schtick is usually composed of running around like a towering dork or just screaming. Elf shows his ability to incorporate his persona in a character you can't help but love.We also see Zooey Deschannel, one of my favorite females in the business today, as Jovie, a woman who works at a mall as Santa's little helpers. Buddy falls for Jovie in a sort of non-conventional way, but he winds up getting conventional help from his younger brother Michael (Tay).Elf is more than holiday fluff, it's a successful romp of Christmas spirit sealed inside a good family film. The cast is lively, the antics aren't over the top, and the storyline unique and film sustainable. This also shows immensely that director Jon Favreau can be handed a script for a thriller, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a superhero film, or a drama and still be able to create on screen magic. I'm also sure this beats a movie about elves working in a tree during the dry season.Starring: Will Ferrell, James Cann, Zooey Deschannel, and Daniel Tay. Directed by: Jon Favreau.",Elf
1511,31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Jolly old fun,8/10,22 May 2005,"Surprisingly, ""Elf"" caught my attention. And in a very good way; Will Ferrell was very funny. The whole story just makes you feel good inside and makes you want to believe in Santa. Kinda crazy, I know. But seriously, I loved this movie. The acting is above average because it is just a feel good movie. So, I wouldn't say take it seriously and just have fun. I think that this movie might even go in with the holiday classics. It brought me back to the days of the grinch and a Christmas Story. Yeah, the story is a little cheesy, but it keeps your Christmas spirit going. So, I would highly recommend watching this around the holidays with your family. It's very funny and lovable.8/10

1512,32,DKosty123,Spagetti Syrup And Gingerbread Men,6/10,22 December 2007,"Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warm feel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds a certain charm. That charm is established by framing the story around belief in the fantasy known as Christmas.This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's. Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has a very small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizable having little chance to do much acting.Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & proves she can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her young career has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes the viewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. James Caan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reason he does not seem to get really good roles anymore.There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5 minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which are funny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here and that is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, his films are better when the support can carry them. His easily worst film is Bewitched where he tried to carry the entire film & flopped badly.This doesn't measure up to classic holiday films but is better than some of the lame efforts of recent years.",Elf

Thrown into the mix is Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel, whom Buddy falls in love with. The story is fun, with a catchy music score and funny characters. I especially like the snowball-fighting scene and the people's reaction when they discovered that there is really a Santa, who was flying away on his sleigh. I also like the fact how they depicted the North Pole as a real place, providing imaginary scenery and ambiance. This movie brings out the true Christmas spirit in everybody, though fictional in reality, everybody should have something to believe in. This movie could of used more comedy, though.

1514,34,sddavis63,It's An Enjoyable Christmas Fantasy,7/10,7 December 2012,"I'm not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, but in casting ""Elf"" someone had a brainstorm, because I have to admit that Ferrell was absolutely perfect in this role. He plays ""Buddy the Elf,"" a human baby in an orphanage who accidentally hitches a ride in Santa's toy bag one Christmas Eve and finds himself at the North Pole, adopted by ""Papa Elf"" (Bob Newhart) who raises him as an elf. Of course, it isn't a good ""fit,"" so to speak. As a human, Buddy is a lot bigger than your average elf and, finally realizing he's human, he sets out for New York City (with no knowledge of the world outside the North Pole) and sets out to find his father, who he's been told is Walter Hobbs (James Caan) - a big publishing executive working at the Empire State Building. Essentially, the story is about Buddy trying to fit into life in the real world, and to be honest, it's really quite enjoyable and sometimes even quite funny.The cast all do quite well with their parts, although I thought that we didn't really need a love angle for Buddy, represented by Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) - who's adorably cute, but I'm not sure she was essential to the story. Every movie of this type, of course, needs a scrooge-type character to be reformed and filled with the Christmas spirit. Here, that was supposed to be Walter, but I honestly didn't find Walter to be scrooge-like enough. He seemed to be a basically nice guy who was himself just being overworked by an overbearing boss (in a limited role played by Michael Lerner.) I didn't get the jarring ""turnaround"" in Walter's attitude that you often get from this. He seemed to accept Buddy too easily - with a bit of encouragement from his wife (Mary Steenburgen.) Still, while some of the characters didn't hit home as powerfully as they could have, the performances were good and they added up to a fun story.It was nice to see Ed Asner play a fairly important role as Santa in this, and the movie even managed to pay just a wee bit of homage to the TV special Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as Leon the Snowman who slid around at the North Pole looked basically like the sliding snowman who slid around and narrated Rudolf (although the narration for this movie, when necessary, was done by Papa Elf.) The animals in the woods at the North Pole also reminded me of the animals in Rudolf.It's a cute story, good fun for the family in the Christmas season. (7/10)",Elf

Being a couple of sizes bigger then the Elfs that he lived and worked with at the toy factory Buddy felt out of place and with his overly big hands he was clumsy in making toys as perfectly and delicately as your average Elf. Buddy considered himself to be, to the horror of his fellow Elfs, a ""Cotton-Headed Ninny Muffin"". One day Buddy's dad Papa Elf, Bob Newheart, came clean with the obviously confused Buddy and let the truth come out: Buddy your not an Elf your a Human. Buddy,were told, was left at the steps of an Cathloic Orphanage to be brought up by the Nuns there. One Christman Eve Santa came to town and Buddy slipped into his bag of toys and ended up in the North Pole and was secretly made to think that he's an Elf by Santa Papa Elf and all the Elfs working there. Now with the truth about him and his real dad Walter Hobbs, James Caan, a greedy and unfeeling children's book publisher who's, O' My God, on Santa's naughty list! Buddy crosses the seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest and past the Sea of Twirly Swirly Gumdrops and finally goes through, on foot, the Lincoln Tunnel to the magic city, New York, to finally meet his dad who he never knew up until now. Looked at as ""Some kind of Nut"" at first Buddy's good and child-like nature, as well as his belief in the Christmas Spirit and Santa Claus, wins over everyone that he meets. From his dad Walter to his step-mom Emily Hobbs and younger brother Michael, Mary Steenburgen & Daniel Tay,as well as Jovie, Zooey Deschanel, the girl who he worked with as an Elf, what else,at Gimbel's Depertment Store. Through Buddy's skills as a toy maker as well as his all around good nature he made believer's of everyone in New York City that there is a Santa as well as a Christmas Spirit. Buddy did it with a little help from his newly found and made friends who at first didn't believe him and even thought that he was just a wee bit mentally unstable. Heartwarming Christmas Movie with Will Ferrell perfect as Buddy the Elf who saved Christmas with James Cann as his grouchy but later Santa believing dad. Jovie who has a beautiful singing voice but was too stage frighten to sing in front of people, she only could sing in the shower, was so motivated by Buddy's actions to open up her voice in public at New Yorks Central Park, singing a Christmas Carol, where everyone in the park joined in including Buddy's at first apprehensive dad Walter.

Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.Elf is the story of an orphan who accidentally makes his way into Santa's magical bag on Christmas Eve as a baby. When Santa discovers him he puts him in the care of the elves, in particular Papa Elf. The elves raise him as one of their own despite his size difference and a few other more human traits he is raised to believe he is just another Elf. Buddy as he is known has now reached the age that Papa Elf believes he should know the truth, especially considering that Buddy has a real father, alive and well who didn't even know he existed. Buddy is excited about making his way to New York City to meet his real father. He travels from the safe land of The North Pole where he knows and understands everything into the brutal modern world of New York City. Buddy sticks out like a sore thumb, and not just because of his green elf costume he insists on wearing but his politeness, his fascination with the simple annoyances of life, and his insistence that he is truly an elf from the North Pole. He finally tracks down his real father, Walter, a big time children's book publicist who spends more time working than with his wife and other son. Buddy tries to explain that he is Walter's son but Walter has him removed from the building. After being kicked out Buddy meets a friend in Jovie, a rather down on her luck Gimble's worker who plays an Elf for the Christmas season. Although first rather nervous about Buddy she begins to warm up to his childlike innocence. Buddy continues to do all he can to get back to see his Dad and eventually with a blood test Walter discovers this rather imbalanced man is indeed his son. Walter's wife Emily insists that Buddy stay with him. Buddy does everything he can to spread Christmas cheer and turn everything more ""Christmas-y"" wherever he goes. Unfortunately his ignorance to the real world infuriates Walter and he just wants Buddy to go away but both his wife and other son have become very attached to Buddy. Buddy tries his hand at working with Walter, which causes disaster, and eventually Buddy finds himself all alone until Santa has a bit of a disaster himself and crashes the sleigh into Central Park. The sleigh won't fly because their is no Christmas spirit left. Fortunately Buddy has touched enough people's lives for Jovie and Emily and Michael to bring Christmas spirit back for everyone including Walter who finally realizes what is important. Buddy will save Christmas for everyone!! Buddy is a great Christmas character. His naivety and ignorance is funny but touching and cute. Ferrell actually does manage to pull that off thank goodness. Although I don't know if they make Buddy pure enough that it actually comes across that he is touching these people's lives. The real laughs are with the physical comedy in the film, mostly entirely done by Ferrell but it's very funny. James Caan is so out of place and yet so perfect for the role of Walter. He fits in but doesn't at all which is kind of strange. Bob Newhart as the narrator and Papa Elf is also a great little cameo. And the great Ed Asner as bit rough around the edges but very caring Santa is also great. Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie is a good choice. Although at first she doesn't seem like the right pick they actually have decent chemistry and she plays her role with a lot of depth for the short time she gets. Director Jon Favreau does a good job of creating something I actually compared to the amazing classic Miracle on 34th Street. Much of this film reminded me of a more updated modern version of that film which is a great honor. While I don't think Elf has the staying power it's still a cute little Christmas film with a tolerable Will Ferrell and a good family film. Pick it up this Christmas or even if you just feel like being in the Christmas Spirit. 8.5/10",Elf
1519,39,Lejink,Your very good elf...,7/10,14 December 2009,"A delightful Christmas fantasy for all the family, proof that latter-day Hollywood can still knock out a charming festive film, just like in the old days.Sharing with the classic ""Miracle on 34th Street"" its New York department store setting, the story here is as improbable as any you'll encounter on any Feast of Stephen you care to mention. But forget that and just enjoy Will Ferrell accomplishing a wide-eyed but never over-played naiveté rarely seen since Jimmy Stewart in ""Harvey"" as the innocent elf (actually a human baby born out of wedlock) abroad, attempting to bond with his curmudgeonly old dad this particular Christmas (of course!).Thus Buddy's many humorous adventures and encounters with the people, sights and sounds of New York naturally take us on an emotional roller-coaster ride but by the end of the movie, as if you didn't know, he's gotten a pretty co-worker (the wonderfully named Zooey Deschanel) to fall in love with him, made up big-time with his dad and just for good measure restored Christmas spirit to all and sundry in a nice, even exciting conclusion, which gives us the memorable sight of Santa's sleigh taking off over Central Park so that old Saint Nick can get on with his naughty or nice list.The casting is very good, James Caan, like fellow 70's tough guy De Niro before him, adapting neatly to family comedy, with in support, the ever-lovely Mary Steenburgen as his too-good-for-him wife and old MTM stalwarts Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, even more improbably as Buddy's adopted elf-father and Santa Claus respectively. Ferrell makes the film though, his wide-eyed wonder infectious right from the outset. The only real drawback for me really was the too-obvious product placement inserts. Otherwise, the film stays away from maudlin sentimentality particularly in its treatment of children and is filled with uplifting Christmas music, settings and spirit, rarely stooping to vulgarity for its laughs (okay, we do get a couple of near-obligatory flatulence and burping jokes, but that's okay, kids love 'em!).I heartily recommend anyone in need of a Christmas tonic to watch ""Elf"" and bring out your inner-child.",Elf
1520,40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Elf yourself.,8/10,12 December 2018,"'Elf (2003)' is a sweet, 'Christmas spirit'-soaked experience that's got just the right amount of edge. It's lead by the somewhat 'restrained' (in that he isn't swearing or getting sexual) yet brazen and unembarrassed Will Ferrell in perhaps his most iconic role. It's also backed-up by pretty much the pitch-perfect 'straight-man' and screen legend that is James Caan. The film is genuinely funny on a surprising number of occasions, while just generally being enjoyable the rest of the time, to boot. Where it falters slightly is in its third-act, where the much more interesting father-son stuff is sidelined - to the point that the 'all is lost moment' and its aftermath (including its initial rectifying and, even, the flick's ultimate denouement) are rushed so much that they feel fairly disingenuous - in favour of a more traditional, typically 'Christmassy' 'saving Santa' story which honestly feels out of place here. It's a real shame that the crux of the narrative is glossed over for this finale, especially considering that the focal relationship and its themes are actually really juicy - in terms of both comedy and character (indeed, pretty much every major player comes full circle in terms of their arc). It's an entertaining experience, nevertheless, and a pop-culture staple, too. It's a quintessential Christmas classic. 8/10",Elf
1521,41,MLDinTN,Not all that great,6/10,26 May 2005,"I was expecting much better from Will Ferrell, but I never even laughed during this. It was amusing but not funny. Old School and even Anchorman at least had funny parts. It was like all there jokes just felt flat. If I had to pick a favorite part, I guess it would be the syrup and spaghetti scene. One question I had why does Buddy act like a stupid 12 year kid just because he was raised with elves? None of the other elves act like they fell off the turnip truck.And I thought the singing of Christmas carols toward the end was so hokie. Couldn't they had come up with a bigger obstacle for Santa to overcome and a more fun way of solving the problem.FINAL VERDICT: Only for kids 11 and under.",Elf
1522,42,g-bodyl,Great Christmas Movie!,9/10,20 December 2010,"Elf is one of the better Christmas movie I have seen. The only movies associated with Christmas that are better than this are the first two Home Alone movies. This is nothing Oscar-worthy but it is a feel-good holiday film. I think Will Ferrell is an mediocre actor at best but I feel this is his best role.This is about a human who was raised in the Arctic by Santa and the elves. When he is thirty, he ventures out to find his real dad. Unfortunately for Buddy, his dad seems to have no interest in having him as a son.The acting is pretty good. I mentioned Ferrell before and I am surprised on how I actually liked him. The older guys like James Caan, Edward Asner, and Bob Newhart were wonderfully cast.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas tale. It's definitely the best one this century so far. I rate this film 9/10.",Elf
1523,43,A_Different_Drummer,Unexpected out of nowhere against all odds classic,9/10,8 January 2016,"This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it",Elf
1524,44,lesleyharris30,"One of the Sweetest and Most Entertaining Christmas Movies around,",9/10,26 December 2011,"Elf is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot and a great comedic cast. It's a film that I always insist on watching at Christmas time, because it's just so much fun, I never get tired of it. The humour remains constant throughout while still managing to be sweet and very charming. The only thing I ever felt was missing from Elf was more tension between Buddy and Jovie's relationship. It's too perfect, when they meet up there is a bit of conflict, but shortly after that they have no real issues, they should have made them split and convince the audience that they were not getting back together, so that it would feel more fulfilling once they did. The performances in this film are outstanding and everyone suits their roles perfectly, whether it be James Caan as a business executive who struggles with the responsibilities of being a father, Zooey Deschanel as a complicated girl who is confused with the idea of falling in love, Bob Newhart as the father of all the elves, or Edward Asner as Father Christmas himself. Everyone plays a character that suits them and their own characteristics or personalities perfectly. The highlight of the movie is of course Will Ferrell, he is funny, charming and very lovable, though the movie may not be that old, Ferrell's performance as Buddy the Elf is already iconic, we can relate to him on several occasions, whether it be his sense of optimism, trying to find the good in everyone, or even just his love for Christmas, there are several aspects that make him one of the most beloved characters of any Christmas movie, and Ferrell is to thank for most of that. Sweet, heartwarming and very, very funny, Elf is a perfect film to watch at Christmas time that the whole family will enjoy. When Buddy, a human raised by elves in the North Pole, learns that his real father lives in New York, he heads off to find him.Best Performance: Will Ferrell",Elf
1525,45,tabuno,Enjoyable but Unremarkable Movie,6/10,25 January 2019,"14 November 2003. This feel-good, funny, and entertaining family Christmas comedy didn't break much new ground nor did it really have the quality performances and scripts needed to make this a classic Christmas movie. It was enjoyable and the laughs and the interest, the storyline were all good but not great. James Cann's character could have been even more compelling (though his acting was great) with more attention to the script writing. It's difficult to balance fantasy fairytales with serious, comedy/drama and that's how come such classics are so rare. I enjoyed this movie, but it doesn't really rise to the level of brilliant missing out on quality for style, emotional simplicity, and basic family entertainment.

Will Ferrell is endlessly entertaining in just about anything. Zooey Deschanel is especially stunning in this role, she's a glow of true beauty. Elf is so much fun as should be to many others too!

1528,48,tomgillespie2002,Reminds you that it's no fun being cynical,6/10,22 December 2016,"At first glance, Elf would appear to be one of countless holiday- season cash-ins with daft costumes and even sillier special effects, featuring a well-known actor performing pantomime on a bigger budget and grabbing an easy pay-day in the process. That is stars Will Ferrell, one of cinema's most naturally hilarious funnymen who seems to be caught up in an endless loop of mediocrity - Blades of Glory and Stranger than Fiction excluded - as the titular human-turned- elf, bodes even worse. Throw in some little people dressed in elf costumes and a romance involving surely the only woman to accept a date with a man who claims to be from the North Pole, and it would seem like a movie tailor-made for a critical beat-down.Only Elf is genuinely charming, and even more alarmingly, incredibly funny at times. Using Ferrell's man-child comedy chops to the fullest extent, this may actually be the best work Ferrell has ever done. He plays Buddy, an orphan accidentally whisked off to Santa's homeland as a baby. Taken in by the sympathetic Papa Elf (the wonderful Bob Newhart), it doesn't take long until Buddy is towering over his adoptive father and his co-workers. Learning of his biological pop Walter (played by James Caan) and that he is in fact a human, the 6-foot elf journeys to New York City to be with his real family, only for his miserable publisher dad to shun him. Buddy learns that his world no longer buys into tales of flying reindeers and a jolly fat man who knows if we've been bad, disbelieving in the 'magic' of Christmas and draining the power from Santa's sleigh in the process.Directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, Elf is pretty standard stuff story-wise, and is hampered by a predictable sub-plot involving Walter's struggling publishing company and his dire need to lighten up. Yet there are many touching moments, particularly in the scenes involving Buddy and his young half- brother, and the former's awkward courting of a pretty toy store assistant (Zooey Deschanel) initially freaked out by his maniacal claims but who eventually succumbs to his hyperactive charms. It all inevitably leads to a climax built around a special-effect laden set-piece as Santa struggles to deliver the presents with a dying sleigh, but this is expected from a movie designed to win over those looking for something easy-going and festive. The world has grown cynical, and perhaps so have I, but Elf reminded me that it is no fun being so.",Elf
1529,49,Movie Nuttball,Elf!,10/10,24 December 2004,"One of the funniest Christmas movies is Elf that stars Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Edward Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Deschanel, and Michael Lerner! Wil Ferrell is is just excellent in this film. He hilarious and charming and I really like his character. Caan is also very good in the film and so is Steenburgen. Lerner has a very good performance too. The acting by everyone else in the film is good. There are so many hilarious moments in this picture and when I saw Elf it I just could not believe it! Its that funny! I love Ferrell's walk in the park. The music by John Debeney is excellent! If you want to see Wil Ferrell as a hilarious character and want to see a very good Christmas film then I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy Elf today!

1530,50,zkonedog,Will Ferrell Creates Iconic Christmas Character,7/10,27 February 2017,"Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (or re-watching) of the great holiday classics (""Wonderful Life"", ""Home Alone"", etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 to actually sit down and watch ""Elf"" all the way through. While maybe not jumping up to the top of my ""all-time Christmas list"", I did find Elf to be an enjoyable romp.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy (Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up with Santa Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is an actual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. As such, he decides to strike out for the ""human world"" in order to find his real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of his endearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all those around him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).To me, ""Elf"" is primarily a success because of the iconic character that Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant and corny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every single scene. Quotes like ""You sit on a throne of lies"", ""Bye buddy, hope you find your Dad!"", and ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" will forever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor out there who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched ""Elf"" from beginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously every Christmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it will grow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting it going forward!",Elf
1531,51,Floated2,Really nice movie,7/10,5 October 2008,"When i first thought about seeing this film, I was expected it to be some cheesy Christmas movie where Will Ferrell acts like an idiot but i was pretty wrong. Will Ferrell's character is a 30 year elf and he acts as if he hasn't seen humans..Although some of his acting is a little over the top he plays his character well. But other than that, the movie is a really nice Christmas movie. Its a classic Christmas story.In the beginning it starts out a little boring but then it picks up the pace and the movie gets more interesting. It starts better when Buddy (Will Ferrell) goes and moves out of his elf home and decides to find he's real dad in New York...This movie isn't really funny but it has some funny scenes. For example when Buddy goes to the mall and see's Santa Clause for the first time but he notices that its an impostor, then they start fighting...Another funny scene is when Buddy hangs out with his brother Michael after school then they see bullies throwing snow balls at them, so Buddy starts making a ton of snow balls then they start firing back at them and the bullies leave and run away. That was classic The movie is a really nice film but it has its mistakes, anyway great work",Elf
1532,52,pmtelefon,I'm still surprised this became a classic,6/10,10 December 2020,"I remember when I saw ""Elf"" in the theater. I thought it was pretty funny. I never would have guessed that 17 years later it would become a Christmas classic. There are a lot of laughs in this movie. There's also a lot of good music. The cast is very likeable, especially a dreamy Zooey Deschanel. They all do a nice job. ""Elf"" has so much goodwill going for it that it almost gets over its bumps in the road. For some reason, it's never a completely satisfying watch with me.

The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus the animation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa's elf's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writer apparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(Zooey Deshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten with her.I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to this movie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside song from Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work by some guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I like how the characters interact with our world and that.

It's a movie the whole family can enjoy.This movie is about Buddy. He was a baby in an orphanage and on Christmas Eve, when Santa came, he sneaked his way into Santa's sack of toys and ended going to the North Pole with him. An elf adopted him and cared for him as if he were his own. When Buddy grew up, he never knew why he was so big compared the other children. One day, when he was an adult, they told him that he isn't an elf. Buddy was surprisingly okay with it, and set off to New York City to find his birth Dad. Once he does, he tries so hard to get his Dad to like him, but nothing worked. Eventually, Buddy had to stay with his Dad and his Dad's wife and kids. Buddy met a beautiful girl who worked in a department store. Buddy set up all Christmas decorations, as an elf would do. Eventually, his Dad believes him when he says for the umpteenth time that he's an elf. And everything works out.Recommended for: Families and children.Do they say the title of the movie, in the movie: Yes.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.",Elf
1537,57,Polaris_DiB,Maintains its gift of charm.,6/10,11 August 2011,"I actually was not all that remiss to seeing this, Jon Favreau is one of my favorite filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Zathura is Where the Wild Things Are without the cerebralness or Karen O, I am of the camp that considers Iron Man and its sequel to be both living up to and counterbalancing Nolan's machismo brooding tale of The Dark Knight, Cowboys vs. Aliens promises to be geeky fanboy action in CGI awesomeness about in a blender with some actual plot and characters.I find Will Ferrell insufferable when he yells.Will Ferrell is like Jim Carrey. People like him mugging, mocking, yelling, contorting his face, and generally just being a big child, when homeboy could actually continue to keep making awesome stuff like Stranger than Fiction (or in Carrey's case, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). For whatever reason, actually having a character is animus to an audience that just wants a clown banging his head against a wall. I'm sorry, Will Ferrell. You deserve better than that.So anyway, this movie is a modern classic for the Yuletide Time and for what it's worth, I can definitely see why. Buddy's absolute belief in Christmas cheer and his grinning dedication to spreading it is infectious, in its own way. It helps that the cynicism of the other characters actually works out sensibly. The movie still has to have its regrettable prolonged burp jokes, but it's nice to see things like random-taxi-hits-lead turn into actual character development as Buddy progressively gets a handle of this strange New York reality world he's found himself in and starts to adapt to its landscape... but all without losing his spiritedness. I can get behind that.Could be better. It did feel like just a few scenes were missing in the love subplot between Buddy and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).What won me over in this movie was the North Pole land and the CGI references to old stop-motion animation Christmas movies of the past. Leon the Snowman is where it's at. Also, not only is Peter Dinklage an underrated actor, but his work in this movie shows he could do some really remarkable stuff if we'd all get over the ""But it's funny 'cause he's a little person"" aspect of it. Compare his role here (oh so woefully, woefully short, oh so scene-stealing) to his work in The Station Agent and then his work in Death at a Funeral (the, uh, British one, not the redundant and confusingly way too soon after remade one) and this man has a gift.So what the hey, seal of approval for this one. Going back to Favreau, I can't emphasize enough he knows how to keep a movie moving and never outstays his welcome, Elf moves at a brisk pace and is over before you know it, whether you like it or not. Now that audiences are actually getting comfortable watching giant robot movies for two and a half hours or more, the art of moving along, one of Hollywood's major entertainment assets, sometimes feels like it's getting lost.--PolarisDiB",Elf

""Elf"" is 100% a Christmas movie.It has elves in it(honest!),reindeer,some cute North Pole creatures including a wonderfully surreal narwhal that pops its head out of the water to say farewell to Buddy(Mr W.Ferrell) as he leaves on his Odyssey to the Big Apple. Chief amongst the elves is the wonderfully laconic Mr B.Newhart - remembered with affection by my generation for his brilliantly inventive one - sided telephone conversations.His is the voice - over that helps the story move along. What I loved most about ""Elf"" was its unremitting optimism,its belief in the inherent decency of mankind despite all the evidence to the contrary not only in 2003 but even more so today. It has all the wonder and innocence of childhood and the deeply - held conviction that we lose rather than gain wisdom as we grow older. Mr J.Caan,splendid as Buddy's natural father, is a deeply suspicious man totally unable to accept his newly - acquired son at face value.Miss M.Steenburgen - perhaps more in touch with her inner child - has an immediate empathy with him.Here is an actress who has grown more beautiful and honest as she has got older. With all the best bits from many earlier Christmas movies lovingly embedded,""Elf"" is a pure pleasure for adult or child. Together with its diametric opposite,""Scrooged"",it will certainly play at my house for many Christmasses to come,and as far as I'm concerned the BBC can go and jump for their licence fee next year.",Elf
1539,59,meeza,Elf provides gigantic laughs!,9/10,30 January 2005,"""Elf"" is a movie about a big guy in a green suit that made some big green and made other filmmakers green with envy. Speaking of ""Made"", ""Elf"" was directed by Jon Favreau; the star & director of ""Made"" and star & writer of ""Swingers"". With the blockbuster status of ""Elf"", Favs is evolving into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of ""Elf"" is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not ""toying"" with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find & bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003. It had me in stitches! (This way the elves could put me back together.) Another impressive showstopper was Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the toy store employee who becomes Buddy's fem buddy. Deschanel is an actress on the up-rise who is definitely not on the bad acting ""naughty list""; even though this hot blonde could be naughty to me anytime. ""Elf"" also contains the best comedy scene of 2003; the corporate meeting scene when Buddy mistakes a surly publication executive giant (wonderfully played by dwarf actor Peter Dinklage) for an elf is honest to say as absolute comedic mastery. ""Elf"" is ""boy toy"" heaven at its best; I hope that was not taken in a certain context. ***** Excellent",Elf
1540,60,drqshadow-reviews,Wacky Spiritual Successor to the Tacky Holiday Tales of Yore,8/10,28 November 2016,"A great excuse for Will Ferrell to run around in holiday garb, drawing sidelong glances from the sidewalk-strollers of Manhattan. Ferrell is the ultimate man-child, a six-and-a-half foot mess of arms and legs in green tights, buckled shoes and a pointy hat, matching the elvish wardrobe of 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. As physical comedy and ridiculous enthusiasm is his forte, Elf makes for an excellent vehicle, but it's also loaded with a swath of supporting talent (admittedly, another of the comedian's calling cards). Zooey Deschanel (somewhat unrecognizable in blonde hair) is a good fit as his skeptical, frayed love interest, but the best work comes from James Caan, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass and especially Bob Newhart as his sweet, yet long-suffering, adoptive father on the North Pole. Genuinely funny, warm, sugary and spirited; an unexpectedly effective successor to the Christmas classics it seemingly sets out to roast. Worth adding to the annual rotation.

1541,61,CubsandCulture,Delightful for the kids and Surreal for the adults,8/10,4 December 2018,"If it wasn't for the tacked on and plot driven love story this would be the perfect Christmas movie. Farrell is at his absolute best and Buddy is a great comedic figure. There is so much glee and Christmas spirit that comes from Santa's biggest helper that it is hard to not get swept up in the cheesy Christmas laughs, fun and cheer.I just re-watched this today for the first time in over a decade and it struck me how there is a lot of surrealist moments in the film-Leon and the other parodies of the classic Christmas cartoons for example-that make the film really work for older folks. It's not just silly kids stuff, but there is a subversive edge to a lot of it. Notice how Santa was ready to deal with a mugger for example. I had either forgotten or didn't pick up on this quality when I first watched the film.This film just flies by; neither the director nor screenwriter puts too much time into any one joke or gag. Unlike a lot of SNL comedies it doesn't feel like a skit stretch out way to much. It is always amusing. It warms the heart a little bit too. Caan manages to make the climax work despite the weaker writing.This will be added into my Christmas rotation.",Elf
1542,62,estebangonzalez10,"It doesn't matter if it's not Holiday Season, Elf charms any time of the year",8/10,26 April 2014,"""You sit on a throne of lies!""Elf is one of those rare comedies that grows on me each time I rewatch it. I remember I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but I love it even more now. Not everyone is a fan of Will Ferrell's man- child character, but seeing him wear those yellow tights and his green elf suit is hard to resist. He is hilarious in this movie and at the same time charming. Elf is not just a comedy that aims for cheap laughs or plays on one gag, it is also wickedly smart and brings out the Holiday spirit in everyone no matter how much of a Grinch or Stooge they are. There are so many great scenes and memorable quotes. The funniest scenes in the film are the ones where Ferrell calls out a fake Santa in the department store where he has been hired, and when he mistakes one of his father's associates (Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones) for an elf. Those two scenes were great, but there were so many more hilarious moments playing on his confusion. The love story is also sweet and Zooey Deschanel shines in every scene she's in. James Caan plays Ferrell's father (who's in the naughty list) extremely well. Elf has turned into a Christmas classic, but the great thing about these comedies is that you don't need to wait for the Holiday season to enjoy them. Jon Favreau has proved he can direct some great films and he has a great sense of humor. It's been 11 years since it first was released and it continues to be a joyous experience.",Elf
1543,63,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average XMAS film: Elf,6/10,5 December 2018,"To start off, Elf is not in the same category as A Christmas Story or A Christmas Carol. It is not even as good as Miracle on 34th Street, which had much better acting and dialogue. That being said, for the current generation of moviegoers, who are easily satisfied with whatever is served up to them as long as it has great production values (and this film has), Elf will more than fill the bill. I am a big fan of Will Farrell, and he does a great job of containing himself (something difficult for him to do) and not running amok with sexual innuendo (something that is totally lacking in the film; and rightfully so). I thought the casting of Caan was odd, but the rest of the cast seem to be mailing it in, anyway. Who can share a scene with Will Farrell and survive? Good film for the kids around Xmas.

I'm not terribly receptive to Will Ferrell's charms, but I find him very funny and sympathetic in this movie. James Caan, the script (which alternates between sentiment and goofy comedy without feeling tone deaf-- not a small accomplishment), and the wintry atmosphere also contribute significantly to the success of this unpretentious little film.

1546,66,noralee,Delightfully Funny Valentine to Christmas in New York,9/10,28 October 2005,"""Elf"" is a laugh-out-loud with a tear-in-your-eye charming, updated tribute to one of my favorite movies ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" much better than the tepid actual re-make. Here, the plot turns in a now-vanished Gimbel's, but the family in much need of ""faith means believing in something even when your common sense tells you not to"" again lives in an apartment on the Upper West Side overlooking Central Park. While I couldn't tell from the credits just how much was actually filmed in NYC vs. Vancouver, I'll credit whatever it does, as it is such a Valentine to Christmas in New York, to mix holidays. While Ed Asner makes me believe that he too thinks that Edmund Glenn really was Santa Claus, it is Will Ferrell's consistent wide-eyed innocence that carries the movie. The product placements do get annoying, but mostly serve the script. Who knows if director Jon Favreau, who also has a cameo role, punched-up debut writer David Berenbaum's script, but it is delightful.Zooey Deschanel is a sweetheart, while James Caan and Mary Steenburgen just pretty much get to reprise their TV roles, in, respectively, ""Las Vegas"" and ""Joan of Arcadia.""The visual references to other movies are amusing, from the Disney-like animation at the North Pole to treating the Urban Park Rangers like the Dark Riders from ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""The holiday song selections are mostly classic, though it's nice to hear new Leon Redbone interpretations on two tracks.(originally written 1/19/2004)",Elf
1547,67,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Hilarious Christmas fun,8/10,15 December 2015,"Jon Favreau's Elf is as snappy as holiday comedies come, mainly thanks to Will Ferrell's pretty damn hilarious performance as Buddy, a human baby stranded in the north pole and raised by pint sized elves as one of their own. Ferrell can be overbearing at times with his often hard to swallow brand of abrasive humour, but there's always moments where he reigns it in, sticks to the script and gives us magic. I think that this being a family film dictates that he especially needs to play it close to the chest and gives him a comedic track to run on without derailing into the desperate realm of cringy improv and sticking to the screenplay's wonderful jist, and not smothering it in ego and comedic decadence. It's a wonderfully sweet script as well, seeing Buddy travel from the north pole to bustling Manhatten to locate his long lost human family. His cranky birth father (craggy, immortalized James Caan) wallows in lukewarm disbelief as Buddy follows him everywhere, including back home to spend time with bis wife (Mary Steenburgen) and kids. He sorta kinda finds work in a mall due to his inherent elf-ness and gets himself into all kinds of trouble, until he catches the eye of a hired elf played by adorable Zooey Deschanel, who's got herself a case of the Christmas blues. Ferrell's upbeat, manic tone combined with Zooey's dry, laconic yet amused personality makes for perfect chemistry, especially in their odd, compelling rendition of 'Baby its cold outside'. Buddy blunders his way from one austere NYC situation to the next with shiny naivety and blind, trusting optimism to hysterical payoff, a dynamic which sits at the core of what's made the film so successful over the years. The only bad note for me is a terrifying animated version of the north pole that looks like Wallace and Gromit got drunk on rum and eggnog and dreamt some creepy version of Santa's homestead, complete with eerie talking seals. Director Favreau participates in a cameo as Caan's family doctor, Edward Asner shows up as a jolly enough Santa, and Bob Newhart steals many laughs as Buddy's awkward surrogate elf father.",Elf
1548,68,hu675,"Charming, often funny, fantasy Christmas movie.",8/10,15 November 2010,"Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells a story about a thirty year old man named Buddy (Will Ferrell), who lived in the North Pole. Buddy is the only human begin living in that area, since Buddy as a baby accidentally crawls on Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) sack. Buddy is raised by Papa Elf, when Buddy finally realized that he is human. Buddy decides to find his real father, who lives in New York City. His father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) is a humorless working business man, who has an family of his own. Since Walter has an wife named Emily (Oscar-Winner:Mary Steenburgen) and their son Michael (Daniel Tray). Buddy finds New York City to be an whole different place, since some of the people, he meets are cold-blooded. Buddy decides to bring Christmas cheer to the New Yorkers, especially his father and make them believe that Santa Claus truly exists. At the same time, Buddy falls in love with a shy department store worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), who has an lovely voice. This is one adventure in the Big Apple that Buddy will never forget.Directed by Jon Farveau (Iron Man 1 & 2, Made, Zathura) made an amusing Christmas movie that is somewhat different and fresh, thanks to a very likable performance by Farrell. Which Farrell is absolutely charming and child-like in his role. Deschanel is lovely in her role as Buddy's love interest. This movie has some very funny vignettes and an strong cast in the supporting roles. Caan does his best in a underwritten role. Asner and Newhart has some moments in their scene-stealing roles. Peter Dinklage has one of the funnier moments with Farrell is the biggest laugh of the movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan and Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Single Disc DVD, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. ""Elf"" is certainly one of those movies will play during the Christmas holidays. ""Elf"" isn't a perfect picture, it has some flaws. But it is Farrell's amusing performance gives the heart in the right place, which it will delights kids and adults. ""Elf"" is a very good movie to watch, especially during Christmas.

1550,70,slokes,Needed More Time In The Workshop,5/10,7 September 2016,"Can a real Christmas movie get made in our cynical, charm-free 21st century? Probably not, if ""Elf"" is the best stab at it so far.Up in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers he isn't an elf at all, but a displaced human orphan who found his way into Santa's bag at the end of a busy Christmas and was then raised in Santa's workshop. He undertakes to reconnect with his biological father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a gruff Manhattan executive who has found his way on Santa's naughty list.Odd to step back in time and see Will Ferrell in this early starring role, playing so resolutely to PG sensibilities that he almost seems made of gingerbread. Unless you own Keebler stock or have an aversion to watching spaghetti being eaten with maple syrup, there's little here to offend you.Alas, ""Elf"" is a film that thinks it's way cuter than it actually is. The idea of hearkening back to the stop-action TV Christmas shows I grew up with back in the 1970s is pleasant enough, and so is seeing NYC all dolled up for the holidays. But the story is a one-joke premise stretched well past its limit: Ferrell doing his man-child thing wearing an elf suit in the big city.One sequence demonstrates for me the limited nature of the film. In it, a children's book author played by another future big star, Peter Dinklage, comes to Caan's publishing house office to help concept an idea. Buddy spots him and immediately calls to him as a fellow elf, thus sparking a WWF rumble in the conference room.Sure, Dinklage is a little person and so the joke gets a bit of a laugh, but not anything to build deeper humor from. Why not, since we know Buddy is an overgrown kid, move past that and have the two get into a spirited disagreement about kiddie fiction, or what weather conditions are like on the North Pole? Instead, it's a short joke, some mayhem, and then cue the next scene.The film has a lot of go-nowhere moments like that, whether it's Buddy getting mistaken for a store employee at Gimbel's or Buddy's stop-motion pals on the North Pole. Caan deserves credit for playing his part with a deft lightness I wasn't expecting, and indeed most of the supporting work is fun. I especially enjoyed Bob Newhart as an especially sedate elf who looks after Buddy.There are also some funny bits for fans of Ferrell's wilder roles. Watching Buddy get into it with a department-store Santa (Artie Lange) who he accuses of being a fraud (""You sit on a throne of lies!"") is good for a few laughs, even if it devolves into another rumble. Zooey Deschanel is sweet as Buddy's left-field romantic interest, and the ending actually manages to be rousing, shot as it was literally in the ashes of 9/11.But manipulation is kind of at the heart of this film, both when it's working and when it's not. For all his evident good taste and desire to please, director Jon Favreau seems at a loss when it comes to finding that next gear and giving ""Elf"" a sense of wonder or of mission. It's pleasant and light, and often amusing, but still leaves you with the feeling of a misfit toy.",Elf
1551,71,aidanratesmovies,"That movie where Will Ferrell buys his Dad Lingerie, Eats Spaghetti with Syrup, and gets high with a mailman",9/10,7 December 2020,"Funny, heartfelt, and with great casting- Elf's continuing status as a Christmas classic still manages to this day, due to its true sense of joy and child wonderment, as well as it simply being a genuine family film. Will Ferrell is by far the perfect casting choice for Buddy the Elf, no one can pull off the character with such ease, and make him so iconic. Ferrell has the energy to bring the character to life, and James Caan's performance as his father also proves to be an equally impressive match. The film starts out a little bland, I get what they were trying to, being an obvious ode to the Rankin Bass films of the older generation- but something just falls a bit flat about it, and it adds nothing really to the heart and or point of the story. I enjoyed watching Buddy harass people in New York, always found it really funny, as well as his scenes at Gimbels, interactions with Zooey Deschanel's characters, and him bonding with his new family. Perhaps the best part of the film though is its triumphant ending due to the large amount of Christmas spirit, and truly you are a cold hearted cynic if you don't smile at least once during that scene, let alone the film itself. In the end, Elf is not quite as great as the hype, but it still proves to be a very enjoyable and heartfelt little Christmas movie. Well deserving of its classic status.

Even James Caan is perfect as the grumpy old Walter Hobbs, whom Buddy (Ferrell) visits in New York.
Also, the Elves are all really cute and cleverly depicted, including the kid from the American classic Christmas film 'A Christmas Story' as Ming Ming.
A veteran Santa, Edward Asner is a tad grumpy in the role for me, but he doesn't effect things too much.The North Pole's quirky, cartoony style is inspired and makes it clear how different the worlds Buddy finds himself in are.I watched this film, because I was hungover at a friends house and couldn't change the channel and I am so glad that I did.

Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, Bob Newhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed they made such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of a one note joke, ""fish out of water"" character that really has no development in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf, that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew he was born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars and eating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played by Zooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public.

1556,76,rosscinema,This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives,6/10,22 December 2003,"This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!",Elf

Though a very young child might find it funny, any intelligent person above the age of 6 is just going to be boring.No significant effort seems to be put into this movie. The cinematography is flat and lifeless. The acting is bad. The sets (except when filming on-location) look terrible. The script is bad. The comedy mostly consists of characters extremely stupid or loud. This movie is dumb, and I hope I never have to watch it again.

1558,78,rannynm,Touching Yet Funny,8/10,7 July 2011,"Elf is the story of a human named Buddy who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santa's Workshop. When Buddy becomes an adult, he is told that he was adopted so he goes on a quest to find his father in New York City.This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is perfect for the role of buddy! He really portrays the character's sweetness with a comedic touch. One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it really captures what it would be like to take someone who has lived in fantasy land and throw them into the hustle and bustle of the big city. There are several montages throughout the film. My favorite would have to be when Buddy comes to New York for the first time because he does such bizarre things. If I were to see him eating the gum of the hand rail or playing in a revolving door in my town, I would think he was crazy! I end up feeling bad for Buddy because he is so clueless to how the real world works.Another thing that makes this movie so hysterical is that in the North Pole the props, costumes, sets and back drop are so elementary and simple, it really accentuates the innocence and comical quality of the elf world. Also, in the North Pole, there are some animals made of clay animation. Their design is very similar to the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie, and that warms my heart and makes me laugh.This movie is perfect for family night, watching with friends or when you just need a laugh. This story is touching yet funny as Buddy goes on an amazing journey to get closer to his father's heart and bring back holiday spirit to all. This is a great film for all ages because it contains the fun innocence of an elf that children can enjoy and it also has a bit of adult humor for the older viewers. Although young children will love this movie, I think ages 7 and younger should watch this with an adult or older child because they may get slightly confused or frightened. Over all, this is a wonderful film, whether it's the holidays or not.Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",Elf
1559,79,Kamurai25,"""Smiling is My Favorite""",7/10,10 December 2020,"Good watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.For all the good this movie has in it, there is a fair amount of annoying as well, which is what keeps it from being a great movie.A family reconnection trope, with a character out of his element trope, crossed with one of the most annoyingly positive characters of all time trope.Ultimately, it's a sweet, hear warming story that really captures the spirit of family, Christmas, and togetherness.It also captures all of the insanity Will Ferrell can conjure up for his character, basically as if he wrote a SNL Christmas special and just rode rough shod over the other actors.The cast does a wonderful job of backing up Will Ferrell, but that's clearly what it is.Around the holidays, especially, don't be afraid of giving this a try, and bear through the annoying bits, because there is likely something really funny just about to happen.",Elf
1560,80,Christmas-Reviewer,WOW I forgot how great this film was,8/10,20 December 2016,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I saw ""Elf"" when it was first released theatrically in 2003. I did not see it again until 2016. I forgot everything about this film. What I can't believe was that I forgot how wonderful this film was. It does everything you want in a ""Christmas"" movie. This film is full of ""Christmas Spirit"" that most films never seem to capture. In this film On Christmas Eve in 1973, an orphaned infant boy stows away on Santa Claus' sack. When discovered back at the North Pole, he is adopted by Papa Elf. Papa Elf names his son Buddy.Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to his human size is unable to perform elf tasks. When Buddy accidentally learns that he is human, Papa Elf explains that he was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and was given up for adoption without Walter knowing. Susan died and Walter works at a book publisher in New York City. Buddy travels to find him, whom Santa indicates that Walter is on the naughty list due to his greed and selfishness. Buddy then is out to save Walter and Christmas itself. This should be on your must see watch list.",Elf

He never knew that he was human and he imagined that he was an elf the whole time! Now he needs to search for his biological father instead of his elf father. He finds him but his father won't believe it. They take a DNA test and you know what? He is his father! I must say this film entertained me a lot! It' actually really funny and I wasn't expecting from it that much. This film made me cry from its sweet moments. This is also a great film for the family looking for a great Christmas movie to watch. The adults won't get bored and the kids will have the time of their lives! The special effects are great to see. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it!

1563,83,mike48128,"Like ""Santa Claus-The Movie"" It's half of a good film",7/10,27 December 2014,"While at the North Pole, the first half of the film is almost magical, with homage to the Rankin-Bass animations and other Christmas classics. The good supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel, does a fine job. However, James Caan (as Elf's real father) is a ""cooler"" and sucks all the life out of the story, along with the dreadful office scenes. (I found the mail-room and ""midget"" book-author sub-plots to be stupid.) Like ""Santa Claus"" it's very uneven, and only comes back-to-life at the very end. Both Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are fine as ""Papa Elf"" and ""Santa"". Will Ferrell is surprisingly good as a 6 ft. tall ""Elf"". But NYC is not at all magical here, except for Rockefeller Plaza. Please note that Gimbels Dept. Store went out of business about 16 years before this movie was made. ""Zooey"" is adorable as ""Mrs. Elf"" at the movie's end.",Elf
1564,84,mjw2305,Nice Family Christmas film,7/10,1 January 2007,"Buddy (Will Ferrell) is a human brought up in the world of Elves at Santa's grotto in the North Pole by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). When he finally realises he doesn't seem to fit in, he asks Papa Elf and learns that his dad (James Caan) lives in New York and he's on Santa's naughty list. So off he goes on a quest to find him.Elf is charming and funny throughout and Buddy's naivety in the big apple is an over-used premise that works with charm. He also meets a department store Elf (Zooey Deschanel) bringing a little romance to the tale.OK its full of clichés and the basic plot has been done to death, but the film is still a winner that cannot fail to entertain on some level.7/10

1565,85,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Terrible movie, at least in my opinion",2/10,20 December 2014,"I watched this film last night because I saw its high ratings and thought it might be kind of funny to watch over the holidays. But oh my god, it was terrible! Not only is it full of that hokey happy-joy Christmas cr*p, it also astonishes me how the hell it ever got a G-rating. It's got everything from fart jokes to the main character pulling his pants down to trolls getting drunk to swearing. Yeah yeah, I know some people find crude humor to be hilarious (society is failing), but I think crude humor is disgusting and it really makes a movie a hassle to watch when you have to endure loads of nasty jokes and things you don't want to see. It's just my opinion, like it or leave it, if you think I'm being too harsh on this movie then that's up to you. Maybe I sound like a prudish old lady or something but I'd rather be a prude than an ignorant, rude pig who gets a kick out of fart sounds and pervy jokes in movies.I thought the plot was somewhat creative, but nothing to deserve the rating it has. The acting wasn't very good at all (yeah, sorry if I've offended all you Will Ferrel fanatics out there). The soundtrack was trashy and cheap, completely unoriginal, and I've already called up my mom and dad to thank them for not showing me this when I was a little kid (back in 2003 when it first came out). PARENTS, DON'T LET YOUR KIDS VIEW THIS GARBAGE. Stick with The Polar Express or A Charlie Brown Christmas. At least those movies can be funny and creative without being too cheesy and stupid!",Elf
1566,86,michaeltrivedi,Solidly Good,7/10,9 December 2019,"Elf has sort of went off the map in recent years. It's been a while since I watched it, and I wasn't sure if it was going to hold up. I like Will Ferrell a lot, so I have it a try. It's a good one. Perhaps one of the best Christmas movies out there.The movie is about a human baby who grows up as an elf in North Pole. He discovered his real father lives in New York, and sets out to find him. There, he meets his father, and falls in love with another human.This is some good stuff. There were plenty of laugh out loud scenes. I couldn't even say it had any boring parts. The beginning was a little slow though. It was some solid good fun. I guess everyone else in the cast was secondary to Ferrell, but they all did well. When I thought the collaboration between the elf and his business minded father would suffice the entire story, suddenly new subplots arose that were even more satisfying.Great movie. A must see7 stars",Elf
1567,87,dunmore_ego,Elven Hell.,3/10,14 June 2006,"Will Ferrell is funny. This movie is not.In *Elf*, Ferrell is Buddy, a normal-sized human raised by Santa's elves (hence, thinks himself an elf), who is sent out into the world ostensibly to find his real daddy, but in reality to get his clumsy, over-sized derriere out of the tiny toy factory. In Christmastime New York, still wearing his elf getup, he discovers his father is Sonny Corleone, which must make him Andy Garcia.Rounding out the cast are bland Zooey Deschanel, inattentive Faizon Love, untalented Andy Richter, drunk Artie Lange, gruff Edward Asner, and cameos by Amy Sedaris, Kyle Gass and director Jon Favreau.Another of those Santa-Is-Real films, with the paradox of insufferably obtuse parents not believing in him even though toys must mysteriously appear under the tree every year.Gags that ""pop"" in a 30-second trailer fall absolutely flat in the context of the film and of course, The Message of ""everyone needs to believe in a Fantasy to quell their inherent loathsome selfishness"" is delivered with the subtlety of Rosie O'Donnell cannonballing nude into a public swimming pool.Sonny Corleone must whack Santa, and Buddy must whack Joey Zaza as revenge for wiping out the New York dons and everyone lives happily ever after.That's not how it ends. That's just my Christmas wish.",Elf
1568,88,KUAlum26,"Not quite a classic,but worth the watch all the same.",8/10,18 December 2008,"Buddy the Elf(Will FArrell,still not yet a star at this point)has never truly been an elf. But raised from infancy in the North POle and knowing nothing other than the Elf lifestyle,he is as true a helper to old St.Nick as any of the other workers that are. At full adulthood and finally starting to realize that he's not like the others back home,he sets out for New York City to find his true family,mostly his father(JAmes Caan),now a Department store exec. I suspect that one need only see the trailers to figure that when Buddy finds his true father,a host of blissfully nutty events ensues.No surprises in this film,from the hi-jinx promised to the obligatory romance for BUddy,personned in this case by a bored but decent department store worker(Zooey Deschenal,neither too sweet nor too sour). The casting is so letter perfect it seems almost brainless:Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father,Ed Asner as Santa Claus,MAry Steenburgen as Caan's understanding wife,Andy Richter and Kyle Gass as Caan's underlings,Amy Sedaris as Caan's sweet secretary and Peter Dinklage as a very un-elf-life storybook author who looks like he could be a perfect ringer for one of Kris Kringle's workers. Director Jon FAvreau's movie moves as easily as any,and while I personally wouldn't call this a ""new classic""(though it would still seem like MIracle on 34th Street compared with another holiday themed film that came out around that time,Bad Santa)in Yule flicks,this makes for perfectly fine holiday themed entertainment.",Elf
1569,89,pyrocitor,Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer,8/10,14 December 2015,"At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10",Elf
1570,90,Maciste_Brother,The film's success proves there are a lot of people on antidepressants,1/10,6 January 2005,"That's the only explanation I have in order to explain why such a sucky, corny and unfunny movie was such a huge hit at the b.o. and now on home video. So many people's brains are so numbed by drugs that something as awful as ELF can easily be considered a classic.What's remarkable is how unfunny and predictable ELF was. I knew things were going to happen several minutes even before they were going to happen (for example, the short writer...). And the film's corny attitude is so overwhelming, I cringed throughout the movie. This film is so corny, it could supply a years worth of high fructose corn syrup for Coca Cola, Pepsi, 7-up, Dr Pepper, Tab, RC Cola, Orange Crush, Kool-Aid AND every Kelloggs cereal in production!!! This film is so divorced from reality that it's unfunny. Yes, it's a fantasy. I'm aware of that but the employees at the mail room of the Empire State building are working on Christmas eve? I mean, come on! And I felt so bad for James Caan.If you like Will Ferrell's shtick, you'll probably like this movie.

1571,91,Sirus_the_Virus,An enjoyable comedy.,7/10,12 September 2009,"Will Ferrel stars in the film Elf. Which isn't his best film but is a lot of fun. Ferrell is actually quite convincing as a human who crawled into Santa's bag during a toy delivery when he was a baby. Buddy(Will Ferrell) has been living in the North Pole for many years and every one of the elves starts to suspect something. Buddy soon realizes that he is a human, and begins the search for his father. His father is living in New York, with a new family. When Buddy sees his father(James Caan) for the first time, he boots him out of the house. Or out of the Empire state building. So Buddy tries to get acceptance from his father and his family and succeeds with his everyone else but his father. Buddy wreaks havoc and falls in love with a department store Elf(the great Zooey Deschanel). Elf is a fun Christmas movie. I don't think it is as good as Ron Howard's Grinch movie or bob Clark's A Christmas story, but the film works. Will Ferrell is pretty convincing and the film will get you in the Christmas spirit. The performances are good and it's a cute film. Jon Faverau somehow always tries to bring silliness of some sort into his movies. He does a good job here. I give Elf a big thumbs up.

1576,3,nagsaptarshi,Antim is a Classy Mass Entertainer,9/10,26 November 2021,"Mahesh Manjarekar in his outings in the last one and half decades appeared a pale shadow of his older version, the one who gave us masterpieces like Astitva or Vaastav. Even though he made some interesting Marathi films meanwhile, Bollywood was definitely missing his golden form. Finally, with Antim, Mahesh Manjarekar is back in his pristine form and the audience is gifted with one of the finest entertainers of recent years. Antim is an outright entertainer with honest intentions and does not unnecessarily glorify its Alpha Male The Salman Khan.The problem with Bollywood is that it has embraced trash films of Salman Khan like Dabaang or Ready where all he did was defying gravity, breaking the laws of physics and showing his torso and when he has actually delivered a nuanced performance, everyone is trying to undermine his efforts. Bollywood since the arrival of Covid-19 has been waiting for a smasher like Antim and the Mumbai film industry seriously needs more Antims to ensure sustenance of lakhs of people who earn their daily bread and butter through such films.The surprise in Antim is its protagonist Ayush Sharma, who has exceeded all expectations in this author backed role. He is calm when the scenes demand him to be so. He is expressive at the right moments. And his 'panga' with his megastar Jiju in this movie is a treat to watch. Salman is astonishingly restrained. It is indeed a heartening feeling seeing the macho actor in a role which demanded very little from him, yet he delivered one of his most memorable performances till date. Debutant Mahima is a treat to watch in certain scenes. The background scores are fantastic. As already said, Mahesh Manjarekar is back in form in direction.Overall, this is a classy mass entertainer which everyone will enjoy watching with the whole family. Kudos to Salman Khan and team for coming up with such a slick project. Do not listen to those idiots with calls for boycotting this movie. A film like this should be celebrated not boycotted. Go, have your popcorn and enjoy Antim with one and only Salman Khan.",Antim: The Final Truth

Never expected Aayush Sharma to act this well. The way he has acted in the movie which is just his 2nd movie that shows how hardwork he has done for this role to prepare in the movie. Whenever Salman khan comes on the screen it's feel so good to see him in the different avatar with his massy dialogues made the movie quite fun to watch. BGM is the soul of the movie. RAVI BASRUR is the name who has given the bgm and it was MIND BLOWING.And the bgm suits perfectly well in the movie.

1579,6,anikb-87099,The Salman Khan we want!,8/10,27 November 2021,"Directors like Remo and Prabhu literally were on course to destroy Salman's career but finally he has given chance to a much better director and this is the result.Antim, a gangster drama, as a whole may not be the best film, or anything new, but it was quite an interesting watch. The first half was quite fast paced and interesting but the 2nd half felt like a real drag! Still it revives itself in the final climax which seemed quite good with that adrenaline pumping BGM by Ravi Basrur.This is a rare film where Salman is demoted to a secondary role. If you follow entertainment page, you will know Salman was quite uninterested in doing this film solely because of this secondary kinda role. Still his performance is not over the top. After ages, after Bajrangi Bhaijaan, i am seeing SK where he is so grounded and trying nothing too over the top. Even in his dialogue delivery he is quite low in tone mostly and not shouting and giving some cringy dialogues like in that Radhe disaster. SK should do more of these kind of roles to reduce is hate base.Aayush sharma is the main lead and honestly speaking, he looked quite decent but still needs quite some improvements. He felt average in emotional scenes but in the wicked scenes, he was exhilarating.Mahima Makwana and her father, the director himself, initally reminded me of Sonakshi's role from Dabangg, a village girl having a drunk father. Mahima looks so hot but cant say much about her performance.Sachin Khedkar is good and Upendra is amazing in his short role. Upendra in Mulshi Pattern was the police and here his the gangster.The BGM surely elevates the level of the action sequences and the action scenes definitely this time are not over the top, proper hand to hand combats and gun fights.Overall, a film which i would rate 6 stars but as I am seeing such a decent SK film after a long time, i give it 2 bonus stars.",Antim: The Final Truth
1580,7,nitsvirusboyz,AVG Film,5/10,27 November 2021,"The story has all the elements like land grabbing, farmer struggles, social-political issues, gang wars, but they are executed in a mediocre way. The movie does not offer you anything new, we have already seen this kind of film many times. The first half of the film can hold you to some extent because Bhai is delivering sensible dialogues and delivering punches and it has some realistic action sequences. But its never-ending second-half losses the grip on the viewers and it tests your patience.Director Mahesh Manjrekar has managed to deliver a slightly convincing gangster drama film with this old-school gangster plot. Aayush Sharma tried hard to impress in action sequences, but he lacks the potential that is required to play the gangster character. But he successfully changed his lover-boy image, created in 'Loveyatri' (2018). Salman Khan's fans will be surprised after watching his performance in this film. This time Salman is not delivering improbable loud action sequences and there is no over-the-top drama. Mahima Makwana couldn't able to show her acting chops in her Bollywood debut due to this male-dominated script.Direction 3/5
Acting 2.5/5
Dialogues 2.5/5
Story 2.5/5
Screenplay 2/5.",Antim: The Final Truth

The story, dialogues and scene sequences were pure cringe. The villain can't even act and Selmon is embarrassing as ever. I expected action sequences to atleast give respect to the money I spent but they were lacking substance masked by steroidal fest. Overall just an absurd movie which can be best avoided.Listen to your mind, not brain.",Antim: The Final Truth

No storyline, no logic, not even entertaining, obviously salman fans will like this movie as they can watch any nonsense but others won't like it. I went to the theatre and believe me very few came to watch this movie so I don't even think it will earn well in box-office. Sorry salman, u can't always make bad movies and earn 200 crores. Your time is up!

Those who have seen the original film will obviously say one thing "" Jiss din ye audience ki dimaag hategi, tera dhanda band ho jayegi""😂😂2) Salman Khan as Sikh role, its good to be Robinhood Pandey rather giving the audience a feel, bandar ko sher ka role diya 😂😂😂3) Songs were written by Salman Khan and that's why its was having the best quality 😂😂4) More than Salman Khan, it was Aayush Sharma which I Loved as Salman Khan presence was not less than a extended Cameo role but here, Mahesh Manjrekar had not remaked the Marathi movie, but he upgraded his movie "" Vaasthav"" here....5) Cinematography, characterization feels the audience that they are watching a Marathi movie and not a Bollywood Action Movie....6) Action sequences was quite good except for the illogical sequence which is designed only for Salman Khan 😂😂Salman, dont show 6 pack always...Its fine... Audience knows it.... Give entertainment for the money given at the cinema hall or else ""Antim"" hoga tere career ka 😂😂",Antim: The Final Truth

Mahima makwana gives an excellent performance as well noone cn say she's a debut despite of a little screentime she does a really good job, and the romantic plot is very well directed and entertaining. Overall, Antim is a really good action entertainer with excellent acting performances by the whole star cast as well as a good message given out , I rate it a 7.7/10 stars.

1593,20,mugen-is-here,An insult to acting,1/10,29 November 2021,"Spoiler free review.This is not how Punjabis behave. Sallu acting was laughable. Showing eyes at the camera constantly. Very bad acting and no emotion in this movie and the story is the typical brainless masala + love story (come on Bollywood you can do better).Not a single Punjabi guy behaves like this. Also, all action scenes were way over the top. Too much post editing effects and loud crash scenes gave me a headache. And the camera zooms in constantly on his egoistic eyes before every jump/every punch. BTW talking about the jumps - every single one was unnecessary and doesn't fit into story or action sequence.The ending was too predictable. Even a donkey could have guessed it.

1594,21,tkmce2008,A jarring film that features a tepid Salman & his wicked brother-in-law,1/10,27 November 2021,"There is a point or in this case film which breaks you. Shatters all hope about a certain actor. I have cut Salman Khan a lot of slack hoping that his next film will be good. The slump is temporary or his poor/pathetic choice of roles is just bad luck. But, Antim as the title cryptically suggests; this is the final straw. This is not a Salman film but he isn't exactly doing a cameo either. And don't get me started on Aayush Sharma. He can have his sweet dish, thaali and be a man made out of plastic, rubber or any material he wishes.An adaptation of Marathi film, Mulshi Pattern, Antim is a film about a farmer's plight and how his hot headed son becomes a gangster to give his family a better life. Enter a policeman, who is fed up with criminals getting out on bail. He hatches a plan to pit gangsters against each other.Director Mahesh Manjrekar plays a drunk in the movie. Maybe it was under the influence of alcohol that he made this trash bucket because it just doesn't make any sense. The movie is sepia toned/tinted for some reason and has an extremely jarring background score, which makes you want to rip your ears out. I dreaded Salman's entry because everytime he entered there was that jarring theme song of his. For an actor who does such roles quite well, he seems to be made out of plastic here (as Aayush's Rahul so rightly puts it). He also makes it a point to praise Maharashtra and Sikhs in equal measure.Aayush is no different. He has a perpetual wickedness spread across his face even when he isn't being wicked. The supporting cast is of no use either. Jisshu U Sengupta plays a local gangster (unbelievable, right! But he is the best thing about the movie). Nikitin Dheer, Sachin Khedekar, Upendra Limaye, Sayaji Shinde, Mahima Makwana co-star.Sallu Bhai, this is the Antim time. Race 3, Dabangg 3, Radhe and now this.

1602,29,patel-35166,Ayush Sharma comes out as an unexpected Performer. Khan looks tired and certainly cannot act.,2/10,26 November 2021,"The story was from Classic Mulshi Pattern. There were minimal changes to suit Hindi audience. Aayush Sharma was completely in the skin of Marathi farmer turned loud Gangster Rahuliya. He adapted the swag and style very well. The main crowd puller SALMAN KHAN was TOTAL LETDOWN. BHAI simply looked uninterested. In hindi we say EHSAAN KAR RAHE HAI ACTING KARKE. Rajveer Singh's character was such that he is suppose to be peacefull and calm but that does not mean ACTING is not required for the role. Khan couldn't even utter 1 liner in a single flow (he even required deep breaths in between for completing 1 sentence). And more over playing a SARDAR POLICEMAN without adopting any mannerism or efforts is just to show how audience can be taken granted. Music is dull. Action scenes are powerfull.

1606,33,sharmaakshat-38750,Masterpiece,9/10,26 November 2021,"Salman khan in serious look was very good, Ayush gave a decent performance. Mahesh Manjraker direction is excellent. There is a twist in the end and BGM is mind blowing. Only problem in the movie is it's songs that are average. So overall it's a good movie and finally Salman Bhai is back with the bang. I would suggest you to watch this movie because it will hold you till the end. Hope it's not time we are seeing salman khan in big screen because he is connected with our childhood. So go for it you won't be disappointed.

Doesn't even deserve a single star.When i went to see the movie, ppl were abusing Salman and saying that ""sala paisa barbad ho gaya"".But I thought those were haters, and I also saw the movie.

1614,41,Carolyn_Channing,Finally a good Salman Khan's movie after ages,8/10,27 November 2021,"Went with zero expectations in the theatre considering I haven't seen a good Salman Khan's movie since 3-4 years but this surprised the heck out of me, all thanks to Director Mahesh Manjerakar who made the concept gritty and powerpacked till the end.Salman Khan finally didn't played himself for once and totally got immersed in the character, reminded me of his character in 'Garv' and for a debutant, Aayush Sharma as Gangster Rahulia was pretty good.This movie will be well-liked by the public, especially from those who are neutrals or don't like Salman Khan as an actor, they are in for a treat. Movies like 'Antim' is what we wanted from Salman, if he is smart, he will utilise the goodwill he gained from this movie, which he lost after doing movies like Radhe, Race 3 and Dabangg 3.

SALMAN KHAN the mega-superstar of Bollywood comes in a brand new character and surely bring life on the screen especially in the climax . On whole it's a show which might attract male audience more due to heavy violence but. After a long time we are witnessing a Gangster film.

1654,81,hdmovieclips,MASS- ENTERTAINER POWER PACKED,10/10,26 November 2021,"What worked: So what makes the movie a very enjoyable watch is the narrative that flows smoothly, with layers of the tales of the main character, not just as a movie making scenes but as a very fine well of storytelling. So I would say the director,editor and the screenplay writer deserve an applause for their extra hardworks that's visible in the narrative. I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography and the score of the movie, such a nice treat. Personally, I am happy for Ayush for this opportunity to explore his craft and proving that he has lot more to provide as an actor. I have always loved him and so maybe my regards for him might have been subjective but still the movie left a mark for him. The supporting casts are good in their roles. Overall, a fine movie that hits the right node as a Bollywood entertainer. Even as a non Indian movie lover, I approve the message that the movie hits its audience in right sentimental values.

1667,94,arjunbishnoiofficial,"Massive entertainer after a long time, Salman Khan on rise again",8/10,28 November 2021,"A farmer's son becomes Don as his family goes through suffering and pain while a strict cop tries to stop him.Aayush has performed more than average and sadly Salman did a secondary role with low toned lengthy dialogues but his action scenes reminds vintage self of him. Although Salman has gained his goodwill too with this movie that he lost in previous movies.Other cast has done a great job especially Mahima and Sachin. Mahesh sir's clever and fast paced screenplay keeps audience engaged all through till end.BGM is massive, crew has done a great job. This movie is a tight slap on haters' faces who are criticising it just because this is a SK film. The twisted climax will make you cry. Even if you are not a SK fan, this is a must watch and you will not be disappointed.

Choosing between Antim and Satyamev Jayate 2 was an easy choice.The movie is very well directed by someone who is a master in this genre.Salman isn't the primary character but he outclasses his nepo product with ease. A truly sincere effort from him.Ayush was good but a genuine actor would have elevated the character. Even varun would have done a better job.The lead actress looked good and was quite apt for the role.The songs were pretty mediocre, except koi toh aayega.

1672,0,ferguson-6,"no joke, this is a good one",8/10,23 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not all filmmakers have something to say about human beings and human nature, but writer-director Mike Mills does ... and he continues to prove it. His three previous feature films are all excellent. 20th CENTURY WOMEN (2016) was based on his experience being raised by his mother, while BEGINNERS (2010) was a tribute to his father. THUMBSUCKER (2005) focused on teen angst, and his latest is inspired by interactions with his own son and Mills' documentary projects.From the mouths of babes. Early on, we watch and listen as radio journalist Johnny (Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix, JOKER, 2019) interviews kids in Detroit to get their opinions on all aspects of life and the world, including their hopes and expectations for the future. This and additional segments and the kids' responses seem real, not staged, presenting a documentary feel - especially since everything is filmed in Black and White. In a rare phone call with his estranged sister Viv (Gaby Hoffman, who will always be remembered as Ray's daughter in FIELD OF DREAMS, 1989), Johnny offers to take care of Viv's 9 year old son, Jesse (Woody Norman), while Viv assists Jesse's father, Paul (Scoot McNairy), who battles ongoing mental health issues.Viv is reticent to leave Jesse with Uncle Johnny, an unmarried man with no kids of his own. But she's desperate for the help. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and Jesse spending time together and getting to know each other. Circumstances take the story from Detroit to New York City to Los Angeles to New York City to New Orleans. It's a terrific journey that lacks any jaw-dropping cinematic elements. These two aren't mountain climbing or spelunking. They simply walk and talk. This allows Jesse to experience a father-figure that's been lacking in his life. For Johnny, he gains a perspective on parenting, which contrasts with his professional work interviewing kids. Jesse is whip smart and funny, but also manipulative and confused and downright quirky. The two of them together is quite something to watch as their relationship develops.Viv shows up mostly in phone calls with Johnny and Jesse, but flashbacks help us understand the emotional break that occurred between she and Johnny. As the two siblings mend their relationship despite the distance, Mills and cinematographer Robbie Ryan effectively use the black and white palette to negate the excitement of big cities and travel, so that we focus on the personal interactions of the characters. The photography may be beautiful to look at, but it also reminds us that to a kid, a city is a city is a city, and what matters is an emotional bond and sense of security.Young Woody Norman is a revelation as Jesse. He perfectly portrays a normal kid with normal issues in a grown up world. Gaby Hoffman doesn't have as many scenes as we'd like, but we certainly wish she would work more frequently. As for Joaquin Phoenix, it's a welcome change of pace and tone after JOKER. He plays a man learning to deal with his own vulnerabilities, and he really gets to show off his extraordinary acting talent. The script is filled with psychology and philosophy, but in a grounded manner - ways we recognize from our own lives. It's a reflective film that shows the balance of trying to protect kids and shield them from some adult stuff, while also allowing them to explore and find themselves. The impact of adults on kids and the impact of kids on adults is on full display, but it's also just a couple of guys getting to know each other. And that's pretty special to watch.The film had a limited opening on November 19, and expands to more cities and theaters on November 24, 2021.",C'mon C'mon
1673,1,sweidman-28016,Intimate and Genuine,9/10,27 October 2021,"""There will be so much for you to learn, and so much for you to feel. Sadness, joy, disappointment, and wonder.""Mike Mills' newest feature film C'mon C'mon follows a radio journalist, Johnny, that embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew, Jesse. If you've seen anything by Mike Mills, you know what you're in for. My first of his was 20th Century Women, a film I adore. His district style of making films about ideas and not story either works for you or doesn't. Once he has the idea down, and they're always well thought out ideas, he creates characters from there and they interact with the world around them as is to create a slice of life story. Once again, slice of life either works for you or doesn't. Depends if you want a heightened reality or see the world for how it is everyday. C'mon C'mon takes the idea aspect very literally. Johnny's current project is going around the states and interviewing children and preteens how they see the world and what they want out of it. I do have a Q&A link that I have yet to watch, but I believe Joaquin Phoenix and the crew actually went out and interviewed actual kids. Otherwise the screenplay is that amazing and these kids are masters at acting. The part was talked about in the Q&A so I guess I'll find out. Strewn throughout the film and the entirety of the credits is audio and video recordings of these interviews. It's a really down-to-earth idea that reminds us what we should be looking at when we see our future and the future for the next generation. The screenplay is truly incredible. Yet again, does Mills write in a way that comes off so natural that you don't even know if this is scripted or not. And he directs it so intimately. The use of black and white works well in its favor, capturing the rich tones we usually don't see with the naked eye. We're close to our characters at all times. Everything feels comforting. Even the way he captures each city makes it feel like a wonderful new experience. As usual, he references many texts and songs throughout for us to remember and search for ourselves.Joaquin Phoenix finally won his Oscar for Joker almost two years ago. Personally, I think he got even better with this. Maybe it's me being one on subtle performances, but I felt a genuine human being that has found warmth and struggle in this newfound connection with his nephew. Being with him is cozy and calm, even in the most challenging moments. I think the real standout, though, is Woody Norman. When it comes to child performances, I think he just set a new standard. Not only is he British and you couldn't even tell if you tried, but he manages to embody this character to perfection. He's irritating, lovable, and all of those qualities you see within an eccentric child. His relationship with Johnny will make you laugh (he's absolutely hilarious) and cry at the best of times. Gabby Hofmann plays Viv, Jesse's mother, and though her role may be smaller, she's very good. All of the acting hits in a genuine way where you forget they're acting. This film is incredibly pleasing and has this unexplainable feeling that entranced me. Even in the slower moments and parts that felt insignificant to the plot, I enjoyed them. Every moment is meant to be cherished (yes that sounds like a Hallmark card). The very end, we have a grand monologue from Phoenix. I swear to you, it's one of the most beautiful things ever written. My eyes were dripping with tears and I was holding it together. Then, the last line hit and I just about started sobbing right there. A few other people in the audience lost it. But the screen went to black and the credits rolled. I managed to hold it together, but even half an hour after it was done (and even now), when I think about that moment I could just start crying. That's how you end a movie. C'mon C'mon captures emotion and life around us in a way like no other. I felt incredibly connected to the story and didn't want it to end. I'd love for most everybody to see this and hopefully feel as strongly as I do, because it's a visceral experience that everyone should have.",C'mon C'mon
1674,2,benjaminskylerhill,"Non-traditional, borderline documentarian, and heavy.",9/10,27 November 2021,"This is not a film for everyone. C'mon c'mon is an incredibly naturalistic, slow-paced moving portrait rather than a traditional story. And that may bother some people.The characters captured in this film often say and do things that you will not agree with-I know I certainly didn't. But that's kind of the point: these people feel so real. And their crises are so rich with lessons we can learn from.This is a beautiful, emotionally devastating journey about the inspiring connections-and tragic disconnects-between parents and children. The former and the latter think differently, and they can learn from each other. It's a symbiotic relationship that I haven't seen portrayed as wonderfully as this film does.

1675,3,FilmFlowCritics,Joaquin Phoenix & Woody Norman saved this movie,4/10,12 October 2021,"I am a massive Phoenix fan and seen every single movie of his, but this is my least favourite - by far! To be honest though, without him and the brilliant Woody it probably would only get a 1/10 from me.This is a movie that you probably gonna love or hate, but I find it extreamly insignificant and its not even 24h ago that I've seen it and I already forgot 99% of it.If you are a parent you will see this movie with different eyes I think, but I simply could not relate to this movie and its story, or the lack there of.The two leads save this movie from being a complete disaster and this little boy is brilliant, plays on one level with Joaquin and he is only 12 years old (but looks like 8!) - I am 100% sure, that we will see a LOT from him in the future, maybe even a very early Oscar nomination! A star is born - I hope he doesnt go the macaulay culkin way in life!",C'mon C'mon
1676,4,FelixisaJerk,"Well shot, brilliant performances, good writing, but overall I wasn't swept away in this one.",7/10,29 November 2021,"A really well made movie. Well shot, brilliant performances, good writing, but overall I wasn't swept away in this one.For whatever reason, I was never invested in the story, it did start coming together for me a bit in the last act.I found myself simply watching the movie and then aware of the acute annoyance of just watching it. Not feeling much, not experiencing much, just watching it.Maybe that's a me problem? My girlfriend (who is far more emotionally and intellectually intelligent than myself and also has immeasurably better taste) said she kinda sorta felt the same way a little bit.She said ""maybe in ten years it'll mean a little more to us.""And I think she has a good point, this is very much about a man who falls into a parental situation and for my girlfriend and I, those are just about the last kinds of situation we're trying to find ourselves in.So wouldn't that be a great hook for getting us on board? A single, career focused individual having to step up and be a role model and look after his nephew?The problem is, Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny is just too good of a character, he makes so few mistakes as he just seamlessly becomes a great figure for young Jesse (Woody Norman). And even when he does make a mistake he's so quick to realize it and correct it.I guess most of the turmoil of the film is what's happening with Jesse's mother and father, but we don't spend a ton of time with them.For the record, I like Mike Mills other work, 20th Century Women was absolutely brilliant as was Thumbsucker.I really enjoyed the black and white photography, and the filming locations are wonderful. We sprawl from Los Angeles, Oakland, New York City, and New Orleans. All great cinematic locations.Overall, it's a good movie and I can see how this would mean so much to a specific audience member, I am also happy to see Joaquin put on some weight, after Joker, he was looking really unhealthy. But personally, it just didn't have the euphoric effect I get when I watch something that really speaks to me.I'm not sorry.",C'mon C'mon
1677,5,marlon_jackson,No one likes spoiled children ...,4/10,28 November 2021,"... so always use an airtight container for leftovers.Joking aside, this abjectly humorless, supposed uncle/nephew bonding story was grueling for me to watch. I guess I'm the old guy yelling at kids on his lawn now, because that kid was annoying me 50% of the movie. And the navel-gazing by all the adults in the movie on the best ways to placate him was annoying me about another 25% of the time.Is that really the degree of freedom a parent would allow an out-of-control little brat? I don't think so. The only rule for this kid is there are no rules.The 25% of the movie that appealed to me were the very realistic interviews with young people interspersed throughout..
Seems like some people ate this one up, but for sure it is not my kind of movie.

1679,7,Kelmer-336-137197,"Best, truest film on parenting",10/10,28 November 2021,"Didn't know what to expect going in. It started off slow and seemingly meandering, then it was on another level of storytelling. The portrayal of parents/guardians is told honestly and leads with their flaws. Nothing particularly sad occurs and yet myself and the entire audience in the theater were crying audibly at the end. Was not expecting this film to break me and rethink every parental decision. Can't say enough how much I'd recommend this.

1680,8,offlineman90,"Simple yet deep, watch if you're looking for an emotional movie with good acts",7/10,21 November 2021,"The story revolves around the emotional relation that forms between Johnny, a single middle-aged radio producer, and his 9 year old nephew, Jesse. Johnny is supposed to take care of Jesse while his sister is travelling to another city to look after her husband, who's dealing with mental issues. The supposedly short trip of the sister takes longer than expected and Johnny, whose current work project is interviewing children from all across the country, decides to take Jesse with himself from LA to NYC to do his interviews. Johnny, who at first didn't expect this whole thing to be a challenging task, gradually realizes that it's not that easy to handle Jesse and after a few days becomes frustrated, to the point that he decides to take Jesse back to his mom. However, Jesse is now not willing to go back to his troubled home. Through the process, Johnny realizes that he has to be more forthright with Jesse, when trying to answer his often serious and challenging questions or confusions about life and things that are happening around him. By the end, we can see that they both managed to trust and change each other, for better. The story of the relation between the uncle and nephew is depicted along with intermittent bits of interviews that Johnny and his colleagues conducted with kids from different parts of the country. In the interviews, the kids are mostly asked about their opinion about future and how they imagine the world would be in the future.Through the portrayed relation between the two main roles and the interviews, I interpreted the message to be that you have to do your best to get through the life with love for the people around you and that it is alright to be confused about future and not knowing what destiny has to offer, cause that's basically how life is. The beautiful long shots of the different cities, like LA, NYC, Detroit, etc, in black and white seems to be emphasizing the fact that despite the amazing achievements of the mankind in building amazing infrastructure, highways, buildings, etc., still a life full of color and joy is not something that can be easily formulated and prescribed for the current and the future generation. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and Phoenix did a great job as he always does!",C'mon C'mon

I see this film as a slice of life kind of film, kinda like Paterson. The prefromances are great and the themes are worked in well in this film. The kid in the movie is a spoiled brat, but that's the point. I will say that this movie did feel a bit long, even with it's runtime. That's the only reason why I am giving this a nine and not a ten. This movie made me think about the way I interact with others and how I have changed over the years. I love the interview aspect of the film as well. To me, this film is special.

The triple role wasn't required actually and looks gimmicky.The film has several overdone scenes which lack logic especially the climaxDirection is awful
music is okJohn plays all 3 roles in his same style and does well but is getting repetitive also he is made to shout his lungs at times which gets annoying...
Divya Khosla Kumar is nothing great.Harsh Chaya is okay, Gautami plays the stereotypical mother played by late Nirupa Roy in 70s and 80s and Aruna Irani in 90s and she is okay

1685,1,nadkarnisumeet,Teen Tigada..,5/10,27 November 2021,"Satyameva Jayate 2 review :A honest patriotic hero is bumped off and his sons take revenge with one of them turning in to a vigilante killer. That was pretty much the plot of the original Satyameva Jayate (2018) directed by Milap Zaveri. The moderate success of that film meant a sequel was on the cards and Milap recycles the same story in part 2. Only John Abraham plays all the three roles here - father and his twins who are all hyper nationalists and who scream more and talk less. Subtlety is not their family virtue, you see!!Juggling triple roles has never been a winning proposition for Bollywood stars - the late great Dilip Kumar failed with Bairaag (1976), Amitabh Bachchan's Mahaan (1983) met with an underwhelming response. So did the otherwise invincible Rajinikanth in John Jani Janardhan (1984). In all likelihood, Satyameva Jayate 2 too is likely to go that way if I consider the half empty Plaza Cinema at Dadar where I caught it on second day first show.The script belongs to the bygone era when Manmohan Desai's logic defying mass entertainers were lapped up happily by the audience. Infact, the Sherawali song seems to be an odè to Desai's Mard (1985). Everything from dialogues to action is over the top here. The new found pop patriotism is generously sprinkled in almost every scene with most characters talking in rhyming couplets reminding you of Kanti Shah's oh so bad that its good Gunda (1998) which marvelously achieved this cheesy feat. One particular action sequence in a hospital room turns unintentionally hilarious when John is warding off a dozen goons armed with swords with just one hand while donating blood from the other. ""Do Haath toh namard istamal karte hain taali bajaane ke liye"", he says. Phew!! And yes, the climactic helicopter sequence is reminiscent of Vijay Anand's Ram Balram (1980) and T. Ramarao's Insaf Ki Pukar (1987).Of the cast, John is first rate even though the writing doesnt support him. The actor deserves a salute for carving his own nichè without any mentor or ""Godfather"" and making it on his own stead in this nepotistic industry. Trust me, this film would've been unwatchable without John at the helm. He lends tremendous credibility and dignity to most implausible situations. Kudos!The gorgeous Divya Khosla Kumar makes a comeback of sorts as the main lead after eons. I remember liking her in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo (2004) and here, she not only looks pretty as always but also pitches in a competent performance. The other cast including Harsh Chhaya, Gautami Kapoor and Anup Soni are sincere as ever. Nora Fatehi sizzles the screen with her 'Kusu Kusu' item number.On the flipside, the climax is slipshod and utterly unconvincing. It seems to be a hurried effort to just finish off the movie. As for that twist in the tale, even a school kiddo would be able to guess who the real villain is long before that person's evil intention is revealed.Never mind!! With all its pros and cons, Satyameva Jayate 2 is an average fare which will appeal more to those who grew up relishing the '70s and '80s cinema. This film belongs to that era. Only it has released forty years too late!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Satyameva Jayate 2
1686,2,jetkot,I'm surprised by the high ratings,1/10,29 November 2021,"I think Divya Khosla Kumar got to the T-series bots to notch up the ratings on this pathetic movie, Milap Zhaveri is dangerous, he needs to be stopped immediately. He is making trash and he lives in an alternate reality where he thinks he is making massy entertainment similar to Manmohan Desai. Entertainment is far away from this movie,. It is a cringe worthy ,chest thumping jingoistic patriotism. Please ban Milap Zhaveri or we will have two more sequels of this one with 4 and 5 John Abrahams consecutively.

1690,6,nitsvirusboyz,Not at all Recommended 👎🏻 by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,1/10,26 November 2021,"One Word Review for this film: ""CRINGE""
Cinemas might get closed again after the audience will watch this damp squib film. Why John Why? Why your fans should tolerate this trashy film. And why the makers are still making movies like this in 2021?From the first scene of the movie, the makers have shown that it will be full of cringe scenes and shoddy screenplay. Watch it at your own risk. Everything is awfully bad in the film, insufferably poor writing, terrible direction, pathetic performances, and cringe-worthy dialogues.Some are like:
Har gunehgar ko aisi maut maroonga ... ki agle janam mein maa ki kok se kya... baap ki top se bhi nikalne se darega.Mera funda dandi nahi hai ... mera funda danda hai ... Gandhi ji ki hamesha jai ho ... lekin Bhagat Singh mera banda hai.John Abraham's triple role turns into three times more torture. Divya Khosla Kumar has no relation with acting. Potential actors like Harsh Chhaya, Anup Soni, and Gautami Kapoor are completely wasted. With the high-octane action sequences, over-the-top dialogues & loud background music, everything in the film is unbearable.Some scenes are insufferable and very hard to digest. John Abraham in his Kisan role triggers a mini-earthquake by hammering a plough into the barren ground 😀. Second John pulls the engine off of SUV with his hands 😜. Third John lift the Bike with a person sitting on it😛. And in the climax scene, all three John come together and prevent a helicopter from taking off with their bare hands 😂.Movie Rating:
Direction 1/5
Acting 1.5/5
Dialogues 0.5/5
Story 1/5
Screenplay 1/5.",Satyameva Jayate 2

I can't even expect acting from one john abraham so how can I see 3 expressionless John Abrahams at once? Pure nonsense movie, it feels like producer, director and actors were joking around and made this nonsense to Torture audience or to take some Revenge from us. This movie should only be played in Jail or hell.

1693,9,jordansteel,Standard action with a dash of patriotism and muscle but still entertaining,6/10,27 November 2021,"Standard action, actually good action movie. Just what it says it is, nothing less or more.Pretty much in line with SJ1, added the dual role, and well done at that. Johns still pretty beefed and cut out for an almost 50 year old. Degraded a shade from the force look (Shoulders there were much better) but still has it, in terms of physique and acting more or less the same, no oscar winner but pretty good in his own rights. Divya not bad but needs a little more work. Didnt expect a intellectually stimulating plot so got what i paid for.Overall, a treat for action movie fans and John fans. Pl avoid if you are expecting something else.For genre fans itll be an 8, for balanced others it would be a 5 so the 6.5 rating on imdb appears perfect.",Satyameva Jayate 2

1696,12,tkmce2008,"An outdated trash featuring triple the number of slaps, spanks & flexes",2/10,27 November 2021,"Satyameva Jayate 2 pulled a Marvel with its trailer. I actually believed that all three avatars of John Abraham existed together in the film. But sadly, that was all a farce. Milap Milan Zaveri returns with the (spiritual) sequel to his 2018 violent film; Satyameva Jayate starring Buy 2 Get 1 Free John Abraham, producer & actor Divya Khosla Kumar; who surprisingly doesn't sing for herself in the film and other irrelevant cast members who don't survive the triple Joh Abraham punch/slap/flex/spank.Balram Azad's (Papa Abraham) twins become the Home Minister (Homey Abraham) & a self proclaimed flamboyant cop (Flex Abraham). Together they battle corruption in the country. The sequel is basically multiple incidents stitched together and at the end we get a big reveal (which we saw coming a mile away because of the actor cast in that role).We are all aware of the Buy Two Get One Free offer at our neighbourhood supermarkets right? When retail outlets try to get rid of their almost expired or expired stock. Well, think of Satyameva Jayate 2 as that expired, foul smelling, crumbling stock. Where Zaveri Sahab gives us three Abrahams for the price of Two.The movie tackles the age old problem of corruption. For people who thought this movie would tackle it in a unique way; think again. It is the same old solution showcased incident after incident. It aims to be secular by covering all religions (albeit one); tackles poverty, intolerance and harassment.Divya Khosla Kumar plays the most cold blooded character till date as she doesn't bat an eyelid when her father is lynched/beaten to pulp in front of her eyes by a group of coordinated & disgruntled farmers.If Milap Zaveri is making a third film in this franchise, then we will have two Papa Abrahams who are brothers, they both have a pair of twins, who also grow up to be Abrahams. So, we get 2+ 2+2 = 6 John Abrahams at the cost of our soul.",Satyameva Jayate 2

Cringy dialogues , wrost performance , can not tolarate 3 John Abraham 😂. Can not give 0 start that's why I gave 1 star. Nora Fatehi also deserves 1 star but the lyrics of the song is so much out of the box 🙆. ""Kusu kusu and suku suku"". Overall don't waste your valuable time.

Action is pathetic, dialogues are pathetic, background music is atrocious, even acting is very dull and good for nothing. Worst music some of the songs are remaked only one song is good ""Jana gana mana"". Only one thing is good unity and equality between every religion.

1782,0,SAMTHEBESTEST,An average masala entertainer boosted by Rohit Shetty's unique idea of Cop-Universe,6/10,5 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi (2021) :
Movie Review -Sooryavanshi has been awaited since 2018 when Veer Sooryavanshi made a surprise entry in Rohit Shetty's Cop-Universe. In the climax scene of 'Simmba', it was clear that Akshay Kumar's Veer Sooryanashi isn't going to be the same cop we have seen before. He was supposed to be different from 'Singham' and 'Simmba' and after watching Sooryavanshi, it is confirmed. An interesting thing to note here is, Veer Sooryavanshi is a combo of both the Super Cops- Singham and Simmba. He is intense like Singham and at the same time he is funny & quirky like Simbba. Rohit Shetty gambles smartly with the idea of bringing together these three super cops in a mainstream entertainer and he adds couple of strong motives like Hindu-Muslim unity and a mandatory glorification of all the heroes in uniform who serve us day and night. The problem with the film is that it is too typical about its graphics. Not a single scene goes without prediction of audience. It seems like that Rohit Shetty hasn't moved from those stereotype glimpses of 'Chennai Express' (2013) and 'Singham Returns' (2015) as if those were great films. The box office success is a whole different thing when it comes to commercial potboilers but sadly it encourages our filmmakers to continue repeating the same things. It's 2021 but Rohit is still trying to make a film of 2011. 'Singham' still remains his best work post 'Golmaal Fun Unlimited' and now after watching 'Sooryavanshi', i am sure that he will never be able to make a high-repeat value film like that. His Golmaal franchise hasn't really got any good film since 2006, and the same goes with 'Singham' (considering it as a pioneer to this Cop-universe). He failed to leave an impact with every film he made after Singham but the problem is, he never learnt from mistakes. Rather, he continued using the same jokes and cliches in all his films because his films were smash hits at box office. Maybe the audience wants to see the same stuff again so i don't blame him much but i must say that he is losing his touch.Veer Sooryavanshi, a honest ATS officer is given this tough task to find out about upcoming threats to the Mumbai City. As expected, we get to see the assemble of three ""S"" cops- Singham, Simbba and Sooryavanshi in an action packed and explosive finale. The screenplay is unexpectedly slow in the first half. Actually, it has nothing to show you. It's just a basic build-up. But then in the second half, it gathers a momentum when Simmba and Singham make dashing entries. Those last 20 minutes deliver a complete mass oriented blockbuster experience with lots of action, comedy (little childish) and heroic stuff. Sooryavanshi fails to create a standalone impact. The best possible reason for that could be the anticipation created about an assemble of three cops. The same thing happened with Simmba too. The same average entertainer of Rohit was boosted by powerful cameo of Singham and then Veer Sooryavanshi's introduction. From the trailer itself you know that there will be two grand entries sooner or later so naturally you start hyping it and forget the main hero. Akshay Kumar as Veer Sooryavanshi isn't a normal police officer, he is ATS officer. There is difference and people need to understand that. You come to know about it while watching the film and then you realise that you can't expect him to be out-an-out massy cop like the one he played in 'Rowdy Rathore'. His funny dialogues and seriously-quirky conversations keeps you engaged or should i say they are surviving factors. Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous in every single scene but for a change, this character provides her couple scenes where she delivers some good dialogues effectively. Unexpectedly, Ranveer Singh as Bhalerao is too childish in this film. I don't know from where Rohit got this idea to present him in so funny manners that you even forget that he playing a police officer. He looks like comedian who is trying to bring those much needed gags in serious situations. That's not what we saw in Simmba. The same mistakes have been repeated with Ajay Devgn's character Singham. Shetty uses his mass values but forgets to keep his class alive. For instance you enjoy watching Singham when he makes a heroic entry but then you suddenly see him doing unnecessary comedy in utterly serious situations. Actually all three cops to be precise. I mean who cracks jokes when you are fighting with terrorists in a locked premises and a bomb on body?Sooryavanshi has a big cast to fill the negative bag but none of them makes any difference. Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Sikander Kher, Nikiteen Dheer all are decent in their roles but nobody really looks like playing a dangerous villian. Of course i don't expect every Rohit Shetty film to have a terrific villain like Jaykant Shikare played by Prakash Raj but please give us something convincing at least. The music adds more glamour and entertainment in the film but slows down the pace. 'Aila Re Aila"" comes with end credits, 'Mere Yaara' is strictly average and 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is there right after Interval point to surprise you. It does not match the original of course, but it's Hot! Rohit Shetty repeats those old cliches to satisfy his hardcore fans and maybe that's what they want. The struggle of cinematographer can be seen in those unstable frames. Thankfully, the background score is stimulating. Simmba had better though, which, you can experience here again on Ranveer's entry scene. Singham's BGM is out of reach by far.Coming to the plus points, Rohit Shetty challenges himself to deliver some socially important stuff here. Like in Simbba, he tried to convey the seriousness of 'Rape Cases In The Country', here he brings patriotism and nationalism. He makes sure that every single thing is enjoyed by masses and family audiences. I am not sure if quality cinema lovers will like it. All said enough, i must say that Sooryavanshi is a relief for cinema industry as it brings back that much needed commercial cinema. We have been missing a big event film like this for almost 20 months, and here it is. Sooryavanshi deserves to be watched once with normal expectations. But the hype and excitement of assembled version of cops is left behind. In normal time (in 2020 i mean), it would have been a Super Hit at box office for sure. Predicting the box office fate today is difficult, especially for a film which is entitled to set the new parameters. With Sooryavanshi, we will know the new dimensions of box office so let's support it for that. Overall, an average film uplifted by first-ever grand assemble of three massy friendly characters in modern bollywood.RATING - 6/10*",Sooryavanshi
1783,1,Fella_shibby,Terrible screenplay n poorly done action sequences. Better watch something on Netflix/Prime/Tubi or better rewatch Sarfarosh which is the best cop movie frm Bollywood.,1/10,5 November 2021,"Tubi is legal n totally free. They have amazing Hollywood movies.Sarfarosh is one of the best cop movie ever made n it is very realistic, gripping n gritty.The cops in Sarfarosh/Bullit/The French Connection doesn't hang around in helicopters n defy physics.Coming back to this movie, there is nothing redeemable in this movie.Basically its a poor man's Michael Bay movies rip off.Ranveer Singh's character gets on ur nerves with his accent n body movements.So much overacting man.Akshay's character is totally unbelievable n anti physics.His walks, his mannerisms n body language doesn't look like that of a cop.I dont know how Devgn got trapped into this abysmal movie.Some of the 80s Hollywood action movies are much better than this lousy movie.If u are in the mood for realistic n good cop movies then better watch Sarfarosh, Bullit, The French Connection, End of Watch, Training Day, Serpico and the amazing Infernal Affairs. Avoid The Departed which is the remake of Infernal Affairs.",Sooryavanshi
1784,2,nadkarnisumeet,First experience after 18 months!!,7/10,5 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi review :Finally something for the theatre owners to cheer about. Also for us, the audience!!The first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...Rohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. À la March 1993.Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.Infact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed ""Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani"" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!Post interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!The dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres please!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Sooryavanshi
1785,3,user-651-726996,Pathetic.,1/10,11 November 2021,"Pathetic writing. Unnecessary characters. Horrible moments. Bakwas dialogues. When a terrorist is in front of the cops and they know he is a terrorist, they should capture or shoot him. Cop with a rifle sees guys with bomb & yet keeps whistling instead of using the weapon. Here they are looking at each other and then at the terrorist and vice versa. Such horrible & disgusting moments and they say in the beginning they dedicate this film to our real heroes Mumbai Police, ATS etc. This kind of dedicating to our heroes is actually shaming them. Rohit thinks that Akshay mentioning wrong names of everyone is funny. It isn't. It feels so boring. Seriously. Thank god for Katrina's plastic face, the tip tip barsa paani song didn't spoil her face but the reusing of old songs is an epidemic in current 'bollywood' films. Rohit has learnt a lesson from political parties. This film is Rohit's minority appeasement film.Katrina Kaif's wax statue was brilliant throughout the film. VFX team made it talk very well. But then even a concrete pillar could have replaced the wax statue and no one would have ever known the difference. The women empowerment shown in the film by placing Katrina Kaif as the damsel in distress was brilliant by Rohit. He should more often make such pathetic characters.Thank god I didn't waste my money on this.",Sooryavanshi
1786,4,msunando,Action getting the better of the content,5/10,6 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.DSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi

1790,8,eldreddsouza,One of the worst masala films I've watched in my life.,1/10,5 November 2021,"This has got to be the most pathetic film I ever watched. Same old formula but this time the story was too absurd. Terrorists are planning an attack in Mumbai city. Super human has to save the day. Wow, never seen that one before. Just that two more super humans from different movies have been added to assist this one fellow. Bruh, no one cares. Trying to create a Marvel type universe, with cops? Lol. Singham is old now and lacks the charm he possessed in the first film. Also he's narrating in some parts. Okay, then the other fellow is this Simmba dude. Gosh how I hate that character. I couldn't care less about his presence here. As I hated him in his independent film. That accent of his, his mannerisms are unbearable. Casting all these old actors and one new actor, it just won't work anymore. It throughout felt like these guys were forcing it too much and it just didn't come naturally. In these past two years, thanks too OTT and WFH, people have watched tonnes of meaningful cinema and are completely done with this masala crap. Masala is okay in moderation, but sticking to the same formula that worked 10-20 years ago without any thought put in writing the story, I'm sorry but it's just too stale for anyone to even care about it. This film offers nothing new. It's a weak and absurd story, stale songs, old actors doing the same old action (sorry their stunt doubles) and flying cars and stuff that will only interest kids.In conclusion, it's not worth taking the risk going to the cinema to watch this 'nothing new' movie. Stay at home, take a Netflix/prime subscription and watch meaningful cinema with your family/friends.Peace and have a good day.",Sooryavanshi

1792,10,rahul000994,"Akshay Kumar In & As Sooryavanshi Is High On Style, Show And Action Thrills. Rohit Shetty Perfectly Made This For Big Screen !!!",10/10,6 November 2021,"Rohit Shetty has brilliantly expanded his cop universe over the years - keeping the audience engaged and die-hard fans of the genre on the edge. After the Singham series (headlined by Ajay Devgn) and then Simbaa (starring Ranveer Singh), now storms in Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), amidst much fanfare, drama, and blaring theatrics. Sooryavanshi's character was subtly announced towards the end of Simmba. The film has all the elements, attitude, style, showmanship and heavy-duty star power expected of a Rohit Shetty offering.Similar to Simmba, even this cop action saga is narrated by Ajay Devgn, who reminds us of the several terrors attacks which Mumbai has encountered since the 1993 serial blasts to the 2008 terror attack on several landmark locations in Mumbai, including The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The story in film unfolds as the biggest attack is yet to happen in the city, as some sleeper cells from Lashkar have been activated and it is found that 600 kilos of RDX left over from '93 serial attacks is being used for the purpose.Enter DCP Veer Sooryavanshi, with a solid mission and a lot of garam khoon to protect the city from another big attack. He is so committed towards his duty that even his family, wife Riya (Katrina Kaif) and son Aryan come second to his mighty task at hand.With the cross-border plot, the film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An Eye For An Eye, Makes The Whole World Blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The chase sequence between Veer and John (Sikander Kher) on the streets of Bangkok is a visual delight.Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful, praise-worthy, knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay Kumar's show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large. Katrina Kaif looks stunning on screen and her sensual moves to the iconic song 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is undoubtedly clap-worthy, but you can't not think of the original 'Mast Mast' girl of Bollywood, Raveena Tandon.Ajay Devgn's and Ranvir Singh's smashing (quite literally) entry in the second half elevates the film and adds the striking punch. As Bajirao Singham and Sangram Bhalerao respectively, the three actors steal the show in the final 20 minutes of the show where they have performed together.The ensemble cast, which includes Jackie Shroff as the leader of terrorist gang Omar Afeez, as well as other group members Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Nikitin Dheer, makes a substantial contribution to the plot's progression. Jaaved Jaaferi's portrayal of ATS head Kabir Shroff, on the other hand, perfectly plays his serious cop part.While the background score of Sooryavansi sets the mood, the songs are not particularly memorable. The revamped version of 'Najaa' is an earworm, but we don't get to hear it in the film. However, the trio dancing to Daler Mehndi's 'Aila Re Aillaa' is entertaining.Veer Sooryavanshi, Akshay Kumar has successfully taken over the mantle from his predecessors (Singham and Simmba), and with a generous dose of flying and somersaulting cars, this one is quite a bumper Diwali entertainer for you. And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!",Sooryavanshi
1793,11,magadalwarmayur,And the universe expands,8/10,5 November 2021,": I was very sceptical about this film. But Rohit Shetty and his team handled this film very gracefully.It was entertaining it had some jaw dropping action scenes and it is as witty as his previous film.This is the most realistic film Rohit Shetty has directed but all the realism goes to dustbin once Ranvir Singh (simba) arrives after that it is just another Rohit Shetty film.Akshay Kumar has done good job but the scene stealer is gulshan grover and ajay devgan even with their limited screen time.

A Diwali entertainer with same old plot you can just sit back and watch without thinking too much.

Undoubtedly, it had a roaring start. The first thing people were in awe of was Akshay Kumar's entry. The whole theater enjoyed the movie. The BGM was another level. The stunts, the music, the action, the story kept us gripping till the end. The first half was rocking. It was all Akshay Kumar show towards the end. It has been one of my all time best theater experiences. I can't deny enjoying this movie to the greatest extent.Team Rohit Shetty has done exceptionally well. After Chennai Express, it's the second best film of Rohit Shetty equaling Singham and Golmaal I.Welxome to the Rohit Shetty's Cop Universe, Akshay Kumar's Sooryavanshi. Well deserved and Magnificent.

1796,14,sanjubhat,Fultu entertaining masala action thriller!!,8/10,6 November 2021,"Movie review: Suryavanshi
#sanjuzzreviews #SuryavanshiFinally saw a film in the theatres and that too an Akki starrer directed by Rohit Shetty.Fultu dhamaal film, lots of masala & action.Suryavanshi is a fast paced action thriller with things moving back and forth between the 1993 Mumbai blasts & present day Mumbai with terrorists planning a bigger dhamaka for the financial capital of India & it is up to super cop Akki to stop them.Awesome ensemble cast with Akshay Kumar, Javed Jaffery, Vivan Bhatena playing the good guys from the ATS . Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Kumud Mishra, Niketan Dheer & Abhimanyu Singh are the baddies in this action saga. Katrina has a small role as Akki's wife but sizzles in the ""tip tip barsa paani"" song.Ajay Devgan & Ranveer Singh make an appearance in the last 30 mins of the film and that's when things get really explosive. Ranveer in particular is superb with the righ balance of comedy and action. However Ajay Devgan hogs the limelight in the climax which was a bit surprising considering that it was an Akshay Kumar film.Overall great casting, slick editing, fabulous action scenes with a heart thumping background score which completely compliments the fast paced narrative.First big budget film to hit the cinemas this year. Watch it in theaters to see the magic of Rohit Shetty's gravity defying stunts and flying cars unfold on the 60mm screen.Dimag baju main rakh ke dekhoge to zyada enjoy karoge 😁. Don't search for logic on this film.Adios 🙂",Sooryavanshi
1797,15,shaikhirshad-41223,Totally Disappointed.,3/10,7 November 2021,"After Simmba I have huge expectations from Sooryavanshi because of Akshay Kumar and Rohit Shetty coming together. But the mess the director has made in this movie is a huge disappointment. Predictable old story with terrorism angle which is not a good story at all and just repeated in every typical bollywood movie. Second thing there is not a single combat action sequence that will make you satisfy. Only the second half of the movie is little bit interesting because of RANVEER SINGH and his comic punches. Otherwise whole movie is boring and dull. Just don't expect too much because it will led you a huge disappointment.Bgm is the only saving factory in this movie....

1800,18,grarunkumar1994,Rohit Shetty's best in the last decade.,6/10,6 November 2021,"The last watchable Rohit Shetty film was ""Chennai Express"" in 2013, but that was hugely thanks to SRKs charms and comic timing, which Shetty managed to ruin in Dilwale. Simba although decent is not an original work. Sooryavamshi was surprisingly entertaining with jokes that actually makes us giggle and action scenes that doesn't force Newton into depression. Honestly the hand to hand combats is one of the good ones that came out from Bollywood in recent times.Akshay, amidst all biopics, managed to do a good action film and thanks to Shetty, the scenes are pretty good.Although it was fun to see Singham and Simba since multistarrers are always a welcome idea, Ranveer Singh has reached the time where his 'pseudo hyper' behaviour has become irritating. Forgivable here since Simba is a character, but he isn't entertaining anymore.Kudos to shetty for improving the quality of film making post Dilwale and other pile of forgettable craps. If he keeps up to rational zone in stunts and comic scenes, he can very well helm a Mission impossible like film soon.Cons-
Plot is predictable
Story is cliche.Tried too hard to white wash govt moves and forced scenes on 'Hindu-Muslim' unity. Why?Akshay looks really old especially on side shots of face.Movie could ve been a bit shorter.Katrina Kaif was wasted for just 10mins of entire movie, failed to create an emotional attachment to characters.Pros-
Good action scenes on Bollywood standard.Decent CGI.Casting is real good esp Javed Jaffrey.Some jokes work.Is it bad? Not as previous shetty movies.Is it good? Maybe.It sure is entertaining.",Sooryavanshi

The dance, action and acting were so cringy that would motivate you to give up completely on Bollywood. With all the controversies surrounding Bollywood of late, people have given up on it, and the Rohit Shetty films don't do any favors. As usual, if you're into brainless cringy action drama, go for it.It'd be great if Rohit Shetty stops making movies. Thanks!

1805,23,puranjanbasak,Sooryavanshi,9/10,7 November 2021,"Sooryavamshi is an action crime thriller directed by rohit shetty. Here are the positives and negatives:Performances-akshay kumar is a perfect fit for this role. He can do both comedy and intense scenes with perfect ease. To my surprise, katrina kaif has given a nice performance. Her dialogue delivery was pretty good compared to her old performances. The supporting cast is pretty good.Background score-what a brilliant background score!! You can literally feel the thump in your heart whenever the title theme plays in the background. Especially, the entry sequemces of the three superstars is epic.Sound mixing-one of the finest sound mixing i have ever seen. Mixing the gunshots with background music is a pretty tough job and they have done it superbly. Impressive!!Antagonists-when the team of antagonists include stalwarts like jackie shroff, kumud mishra, gulshan grover and all you have to know they are not leaving it easy. A perfect team of antagonists.If you try to find logic in it you are searching for the wrong notes. Go to the theatres, enjoy the film and entertain yourselves. This is a proper mass entertainer. I rate it 9 out of 10.",Sooryavanshi

1807,25,sanjeevanwar,Singham overpowered Sooryavanshee,5/10,5 November 2021,"Anwar Says : While watching the trailer, I thought it would be a perfect Diwali Dhamaka , but the expectations shattered. Once again you have '93 Mumbai Blast , Sleeper Cell , Lashkar , RDx and across the border terrorism and Rohit Shetty's another introduction to Cop Universe - Akshay Kumar .Rohit's love for Mumbai Police World is well known and he has hinted another one. He has refused to change his winning formula but Akshay was neither Singham nor Simba and even the climax action has been stolen by Singham . Rohit should realise that the audience are much more mature in the Pandemic after watching some true and real life action on OTT .Acting wise Akshay always looks a real cop right from KHAKI days . Watching Katrina was like watching her in Salman starrer Bharat, probably both the movies were shot simultaneously, hardly adds anything to the story, which she was capable of , except the Tip Tip Barsa Pani song bringing nostalgia and the memories of Raveena. One chase sequence at Bangkok to get Sikandar Khan was beautifully captured though must be inspired from some Hollywood movie. Gulshan Grover, Jackie Shroff etc. Did nothing much to mention. VFX is poor, Shetty might have changed his computer guy . Background score as usual very loud .My rating is 2.5/5 , now you have to decide whether you want to keep it in 100, 200 or 400 crore Club .#Sooryavanshi #anwarsays #movie2021 #RohitShetty #AkshayKumar #KatrinaKaif #copstory

1808,26,Kaatil29,Typical masala,4/10,8 November 2021,"Watched sooryavanshi yesterdayMy review: the film had no new element, same remake songs, same indo-pak rivalry & jokes that are not at all funny. In my opinion whole movie is forced just to announce Singham 3. Rohit sir we know your love for ajay sir but this is not the way.Most disappointing thing is the song 'Tip tip barsa paani' there was never a need for this song in the film. Singham's entry was too hyped but couldn't deliver upto the mark, Although i enjoyed simmba's comedy, it was not needed in the climax scene.The only good thing about the film was the temple scene, where the Hindu-muslims harmony can be scene. The bangkok chase scene was just not needed.. they should learn from 'DON 2' how to present a good chase scene. Although i didn't liked the film, my friends loved it.I can totally understand why they loved the film. Its not a good sensible movie but can be enjoyed with friends & family. A typical mass entertainer for audiences who love to whistle in theatres. Katrina's acting was pathetic, it's been 19 years and she still can't act.Akshay kumar can't even cry perfectly, he's just made for comedy movies and he should stick to that. Have seen every akshay kumar films and can say for sure he can't cry in screen. First half was very slow & dull, never for once felt excited before interval. 2nd half was decent.Overall it's a decent one time watch for mass audience and everyone should watch it once to support our theatres & bollywood. Expected more from Rohit sir but it's okay he is also human. Waiting for Singham 3 and hope it will not disappoint us.My ranking (4/10)",Sooryavanshi

For entertainment factor it has some action sequence and I think they didn't hold any special creativity also story is really cliche with no any twist.. And surprise element already spoiled for everyone.. That's why i didn't expected too much from this film and I am satisfied not too much but I really think this is theatre piece.Don't think that this film is crap it has many Amazing moments and this thing everyone expect from the ROHIT SHETTY film.I really think that this film doesn't honour too much for police cause sooryavanshi character portrait is good but the depthness for this character is really terrible.

A group of sleeper cells had been in disguise in our country and waiting for an opportunity to give an another blow and to stop this ATS officer Veer Sooryavanshi and his team is on a mission for an total elimination.....Story is not new as from Holiday, Uri , Bollywood had portrayed that how terrorism adversely impact us and how the unsung heroes have fought for us not caring of their lifeWhen talking about the performance....1) Akshay Kumar had given an action packed experience after Rowdy Rathore and it became a paisa vassol movie......2) Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn had energized the movie by coming at the climax thereby giving end credits....3) Jackie Shroff reminds me of his character in Mission Kashmir, but screen space had not given much for him...He was an OK performer4) Katrina Kaif, glamour glamour glamourWhen it comes to Rohit Shetty action choreography, story and direction.....1) He always delivers larger than life movies, be it singham or simbha and we have to just keep away logic as his only logic is entertainment & this movie is a perfect example for it....2) Action designed by him are well done except for the VFX which has brought up the artificiallity in some action sequences but BGM was able to negate that...3) Converting a routine terrorism based story into a entertainer is pat on back for Rohit Shetty......4) By appropriate dialogues, "" Passport dekhe nahi, criminal record dekhar thok deti Hein"" , a form of disclaimer that this movie had not made to hurt any religious sentiments, another smart move of the director.....5) Star cast perfect except for the heroine......6) Didn't able to feel the lagness through out the movieOverall an worthy watch as it didn't gone waste for waiting this movie for 1.5 years.....",Sooryavanshi

1816,34,coolhunk55,"Only the title is good, not the movie!",3/10,14 November 2021,"If you want to make a patriotic movie then make one. Don't mix it with romance for the sake of entertainment and getting more audience. The storyline is goofed up. Sleeper cells and mumbai - that's it. Too many goof up with police so that criminal keeps escaping. And in the end of that was not enough, the main hero Akshay Kumar is cut totally out of the scene and Ajay devgan takes center stage. I mean wth. Katrina Kaif is useless as ever with her role and acting. Only person doing justice to his tole is Ranveer Singh who comes in for 10-20 mins and does his comedy lines well. The movie is repeated old blowing up of vehicles. Disappointing.",Sooryavanshi

Movie has background music but they play everytime although it doesn't needed at their time.And they repeated religion equality in india so many times well everybody knows that why they again and again repeat I don't know and few scenes are very forced.

1820,38,djpa-76657,"A greatly missed opportunity, yet delivers few passable moments",5/10,21 November 2021,"Hindi Film Industry is basically a finished industry due to its nepotism controversies, drug cartel business, rise of OTT cinema and double delays of theatre re opening. It only could've been a film of huge scale like Sooryavnshi that could pull audience to the theatres and Rohit Shetty successfully achieved in giving wholesome entertainment, but as a Rohit Shetty fan one question arises, was it really his best? Could he have made it better? Answer is very much yes, he knows his audience but at times misses several opportunities to create pure mass whistle worthy moments in Sooryavanshi. Sooryavanshi was supposed to be cheap level of Avengers feel film, instead turned out to be worse than Singham and as a matter of fact even Simmba solely due to its several illogical moments and unnecessary comedy which were straight unfunny.Sooryavnshi had several positive aspects like fast paced screenplay, going straight to the point, a flawed lead character Sooryavanshi(Akshay Kumar) forgetting his name constantly, performances of the villains- Jackie Shroff(Thanos to the Copvengers), Kumud Mishra, Abhimanyu Singh, Nikitin Dheer, Gulshan Grover and Late Asif Basra. But none of the villains could match the performance of Prakash Raj as Jaikant Shikre was in Singham, till date he's the best villain Rohit Shetty has introduced and Singham remains the best film in the franchise because of Jaikant Shikre. Another aspect what Sooryavanshi missed was lack of supporting characters, like in Singham we had Gotya, Kelkar, Savalkar, Shiva and several others or even in Simmba as Tawade, Aakruti, Mohile etc, Sooryavanshi had all of them missing. Even the humour in Sooryavanshi was felt scattered all over unlike Singham and Simmba. The dialogues by Farhad Samji needs no comments here, it was as rubbish as his other works has been and he's hands down the worst writer/director to ever exist in Bollywood. Also the Hindu Muslim angle was too much emphasised moving away from engaging plot, in one or two instances whatever they had shown were better off instead of showing it again and again. The entries of Ranveer and Ajay were over exaggerated expectedly but afterwards it was non stop blast, with highly illogical scenes being shown again and again making it accidentally funny.Performances wise Akshay Kumar often seemed overshadowed by other actors onscreen, despite of being Sooryavanshi movie it didn't seem like anything revolving around Sooryavnshi instead looked like Akshay Kumar from Hera Pheri was asked to act as Akshay from Baby and it became complete misfire. Katrina Kaif as always acts pathetically, only stands out in dance and even here forget matching Raveena in Tip Tip Barsa, she couldn't match herself in Galey Lag Jaa song. Other support cast as said were wasted royally, none of them leaving any impact. Ranveer Singh in his special appearance was highly irritating and on nerves, his performance in Simmba was far better than whatever hamfest he shown here, almost made me throw stones on the screen whenever he opened his mouth. Ajay Devgan's entry as always was super over the top and every scene including Ajay was way too unrealistic, almost making him invincible superhero. Even in the climax I questioned myself is this Akshay Kumar film or an Ajay Devgan film, leaving Singham 3 hint could've been cool idea if it revolved more on Sooryavanshi and not Singham in the end. If you're having Akshay(Ironman) Ajay(Captain America) and Ranveer(Spider-Man) in your Copverse(MCU) then there should've been equally formidable Thanos who could have stature to crush all 3 together. Certainly Jackie Shroff shouldn't have been casted, instead a bigger star someone like Amitabh Bachchan would've made the 3 look like ants. Hoping Jackie Shroff gets better treatment in the next instalment of Copverse to fight the 3 together instead of getting crushed by Singham single handedly. Overall hats off to Rohit Shetty for bringing Bollywood audience back to theatres but not expecting any other Bollywood film to do the same unless the film is on stature of Sooryavnshi, perhaps Pathan and Tiger 3 or even 83 could do some help till then RIP Bollywood.",Sooryavanshi

Story was simple , and predictable screenplay , if they had done something interesting in screenplay , definitely it could've been a good family entertainer . Comedy worked in most of the places . Cast done decent job . Singham and Simmba movie crossover was something new ( Rohit Shetty's cop universe ) . Few action sequence were good to watch . Music was average . Overall a decent family entertainer to watch .

1852,70,tkmce2008,Rohit Sherry's Cop Universe needs work but Akshay Kumar shines bright as Sooryavanshi!,7/10,7 November 2021,"The wait has been pretty long. Fans like me have been dying to watch the first (Indian) cinematic universe come together since March 2020. And has the wait been worth it? It has for Akshay Kumar's character but not so much for the trio; which is why I left the theatre less enthusiastic than I entered it.Veer Sooryavanshi is a part the Anti-Terrorist Squad. His team has been trying to track down 600kgs of explosives that was buried someplace in India after the 1993 blasts. When they arrest a sleeper cell agent, a chain of events unfold potentially putting the nation in danger.Akshay Kumar returns as Veer Sooryavanshi after his character was teased at the end of Simmba. Akshay's police avatar is the most believable of the lot (among the three) given that he performs most of his stunts and they are less over the top. Also, it is always a delight to watch him onscreen especially when he seems committed to the role. Co-star Katrina Kaif doesn't have much to do (that was a given). Ranveer Singh & Ajay Devgn, who reprise their roles from Simmba & Singham enter the film only during the climax. This doesn't give the trio sufficient time to bond and their scenes feel rushed. Would have loved to see more of them together. Devgn also explicitly announces Singham 3.This is the first film in the Shetty cop universe that has an original story. And this works in the film's favour to an extent (better than the other three). But the plot is mostly the same: old- terrorists with unfinished business, religious divide, the hero preaching to anyone who will hear & some harmless work banter. Nevertheless, it is a mass entertainer and it is the perfect excuse to return to the theatres.",Sooryavanshi

1855,73,danstonhero,Good Masala entertainer,10/10,10 November 2021,"First of all I would like to clear am not anyone's blind fan, am just giving my honest opinion. This was a really good entertaining Masala film. Nothing new, story was predictable but what makes this movie entertaining is the way it is presented to us. Rohit Shetty is a director who knows the exact technique of how to entertain the audience, if you look at his previous films, they have never brought anything new on screen but the way those films are presented on screen makes them very entertaining and that is what this film does. Ranveer remains one of the highlights of the film, no matter you hate him or you like him but you cannot ignore him. Also the whole climax remains the highlights of the film and not to forget the chase scene in Bangkok...superbly done...I was also amazed with the superb camera work done in the climax scene, overall a must watch if you are looking for entertainment.

Back then, actors didn't had Six Packs or muscular, but they had top notch acting skills.Now days, an actor have to have Sic Packs and Muscular and actress needs to be 0 size....and in the name of Acting, they are all garbage, plus the story line of movies, they seriously have nothing to say. All repeated storylines with different actors, remakes and over and over crap.I don't see anything new in this movie plus Act wasn't that Super either.

1864,82,princesabraham,Worst in the cop universe,1/10,5 November 2021,"Hugely disappointed. The intro of Akshay is very low key and that very much sums up the rest of the movie. Movie is so bad that you actually feel happy when Simba and Singham come in. Not that it was way out of the box or something but just because it comes as a relief to the torture. Knowing that the same actor has done a crazy thriller such as Baby, makes it more torturous. You on various occasions think, did Akshay not find it ridiculous..??Old 90s movie just made in 2019. No logic whatsoever.

1865,83,baruaritesh,Same old story with cringeworthy dialogues,3/10,5 November 2021,"This over patriotism bug of Akshay Kumar is destroying his movies and that of his directors. Rohit Shetty falls into the trap this time.A centuries old plot and storyline. Cringeworthy dialogue writing are what are the main villains of this plot. This film was touted as the one getting audiences back into the theatres, but what a disappointment. Same old Pakistan bashing.Katrina Kaif as usual is an accessory heroine and adds absolutely no value. Im addition she destroys a classic song ( where is the originality of sognwriters?). She's a -4 when rated out of 10.The only bright spots in the movie are probably the scenes with Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. The movie picks up post Ranveer's entry and Ranveer's brilliance carries it throughI wonder if these ""Established Actors"" actually read and study all aspects of the movie before signing them.My rating is only for Ranveer Singh's part and that of Ajay Degvn's.",Sooryavanshi

1868,86,parthdeepsinghdhillon,Very Very Entertaining,10/10,7 November 2021,"This is a typical Rohit Shetty entertainment movie with a strong message for the new India - Watch it and you will know what I mean! A little bit of political correctness here and there which I feel is not necessary and which I personally do not like at all; however, this is a must watch for all 'Indians'. Akshay does well and fits right on the cop verse... Highly recommended... Rohit Shetty could have made Singham belt those three...

The movie started and the interval and then the movie again started then the climax, all this too 2 and a half hours or may be more than that but it felt like everything happend in a wink or blink. 18 months long wait for Cinema justified.

1875,93,abhyuday-tandon,Insanely predictable and disappointing 3 hours of constant virtue signalling.,1/10,13 November 2021,"The movie has a very weak plot and relies entirely on cast strength to carry the movie. They do an appallingly poor job of managing emotions. This movie felt like it was written by a child with zero writing skills. At one point they'll be on an extremely impactful and distressing scene making you feel sad/enraged and in just the next scene the characters start throwing cheap jokes and gags as if they didn't just witness gory murder right in front of them seconds ago. The movie has no sense on how to transition from a sad scene to one with lighthearted comedy and often mixes the two which clearly shows how insensitive the writers are. Around 30-45 minutes of screen time is wasted on unnecessary sermons on religious peace and virtue signalling on how people of different religions should interact. The songs in the movie are absolutely unwarranted for, they appear out of nowhere and with zero conjunction to the plot. The soundtrack is extremely loud and out of sync with the scenes. The writers also do a terrible job with antagonist's backstory, the way they portray the wretched psychopaths makes you feel like the writers want you to sympathise with them. Don't even get me started on the endless plot-holes. Having liked the movie Singham a bit, I felt I could go and watch this movie for the pompous and exaggerated fight scenes, however I couldn't be more disappointed. This movie doesn't have a single decent action sequence, all scenes are gunfights with the main characters having 100x plot armour. Overall this is probably the worst movie I've ever watched and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a functioning brain.",Sooryavanshi

Common man, enjoy the diwali with your family with such a good masala entertainment movie.I'm just reducing 1 star for the vfx part if there are so many producers involved then also getting this level of vfx is not acceptable.But beside that whole movie is enjoyable to action lovers, masala movie lovers and also it has some blend of nationalism and humanity. Perfectly driven story, build up of every main characters arc
So the waiting part for the last 1 and half year was worthwhile.Perfect movie to be watched in cinemas only
Dont limit yourself to ott platform for whatsoever reasons. Definitely recommended any day with your family friends
Enjoy the festive season
Enjoy the returning of cinema.",Sooryavanshi

1882,0,jboothmillard,Ron's Gone Wrong,7/10,1 November 2021,"I saw the trailer for this animated movie a couple of times in the cinema, it looked like it would be a good laugh, and Mark Kermode gave it a positive review, so I was more than up for seeing it. Basically, in the future, tech giant Bubble unveils its latest creation: the B-Bot. Created by the generous CEO Marc Weidell (Justice Smith), it is a robotic buddy designed to help make friends and connect to the internet. In the town of Nonsuch, middle school student Barney Pudowski (Jack Dylan Grazer) is the only one in school who does not own a B-Bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades (Kylie Cantrall), Rich Belcher (Ricardo Hurtado), Noah (Cullen McCarthy) and Ava (Ava Morse) have all become absorbed by their individual B-Bots. Barney's father Graham (Ed Helms), who sells novelty items online, and his grandmother Donka (Olivia Colman) come to realise that Barney does not have any friends and empathise with him. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but it is closes as they arrive. Fortunately, a delivery driver has a slightly damaged B-Bot that had fallen out of his truck and sells it to them. Barney wakes the day after his birthday and is overjoyed to receive a B-Bot (Zach Galifianakis) as a late birthday present. But upon activating it, quickly learns that it is defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, he decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed. He runs into Rich and his friends who taunt and try to humiliate him. The B-Bot begins to fight back, as his safety functions are not active, and he and Barney laugh together and run. Rich calls the police and Barney and the B-Bot, along with Graham and Donka, are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-Bot can be crushed. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues the B-Bot, and names him Ron, a shortened version of his model number. Barney and Ron's actions are reported. While Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming, his chief operating officer Andrew Morris (Rob Delaney) sees it as bad publicity for the company. They believe Ron has been destroyed and that the issue has been resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend, with various notes posted on a wall to store in his memory. While hanging out, they run into Savannah who tells Ron that he needs to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron leaves the house and tries to get ""friends"" for Barney, bringing a series of random strangers to school. While Barney gets into trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-Bots to have their safety features and parental controls turned off. The B-Bots run wild, connecting and forming for a moment into a large robot creature. The B-Bot creature swallows and excretes (poops out) Savannah, this moment is filmed and shared across social media, and she is publicly humiliated. When the chaos eventually dissolves Barney is suspended from school. Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-Bot and sends their entire team of employees to find and get rid of Ron. Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron. Following his suspension, Barney tells Ron off whilst returning home, but he realises Ron was truly being a friend. Barney eventually forgives Ron's actions, and realises that Bubble employees are coming for him, and decides to run away with him. They briefly run into Savannah, still upset over her incident, and tells her that he is hiding in the woods. Barney and Ron initially enjoy themselves but end up lost in the woods and spending a scary, uncomfortable night there. At school, the B-Bots have been put under heavy lock and Savannah confides in Rich that they were indirectly responsible for Barney's situation. Bubble uses their resources, hacking into other B-Bots to take control and search for Ron and Barney. They manage to hide from them, but the cold weather and Barney's asthma have caused him to become weak. Ron brings Barney back to civilisation just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah, and Ava rush out to help him. Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates, before meeting Marc who is impressed with Ron. Marc fixes Ron's glitches and thereby makes him a different B-Bot. But Barney wants Ron's original personality back, but Marc says he is locked out from the cloud. Andrew has taken over the company, and the only place to find Ron's memory is to access the cloud at Bubble's headquarters. Barney, Graham, Donka, and Marc break into Bubble HQ to rescue Ron. Through an elaborate plan, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database and finds Ron's original data and uploads him back into his body. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-Bot and realising that everyone is just as lonely as he was, Barney has the idea to upgrade all B-Bots to have Ron's flaws. But this means that Ron will be dispersed into the internet. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone. Andrew is disgraced in front of a crowd of people after Marc secretly recorded him admitting that the B-Bots spy on their owners for profit, and Marc is reinstated as Bubble CEO. Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-Bot, but are happy with their wild and weird personalities. Barney no longer has a B-Bot but has become much more sociable and become close with his former friends. As they hang out at recess, a giant Bubble tower overlooking Nonsuch produces Ron's face, implying that he is still alive. Also starring Marcus Scribner as Alex, Thomas Barbusca as Jayden, Sarah Miller as Bree, and Ruby Wax as Ms Hartley, with additional voices by Liam Payne and Phil LaMarr. The voice casting is very good, from Galifianakis as the cute, damaged robot friend constantly calling Barney ""Absalom"", to Colman as the eccentric grandmother and Delaney as the profit-obsessed villain. It is a clever story about friendship, Ron the Tic Tac shaped Weeble-like robot with all functions of a mobile phone that can think for itself and its protocols to keep it safe not working is a wonderful character, his glitches make for some really funny moments, but there is also cute and heart-warming stuff, and it also satirises the world of social networking and harvesting data, this really is a film for all the family to enjoy, a terrific and fun computer-animated fantasy comedy. Very good!",Ron's Gone Wrong
1883,1,CinemaSerf,Engaging and comical kids story for adults,7/10,16 October 2021,"I'm going to start my review with a moan. Since when was it OK for parents to just let their young children chat throughout a film at a cinema? Or to wander about the aisles dropping popcorn everywhere? My parents would have had a fit, and we would have been unceremoniously removed never to return. Cinema is a shared experience on a big screen, not a surrogate baby-sitting service! Phew, now I have got that off my chest, this is quite a thought-provoking animation. The premiss is nothing especially new, a toy that every kid must have (remember the ""Cabbage Patch Doll?"") but this story has a far more sinister undertone to it. ""Marc"" is the bright-eyed, enthusiastic, young CEO of ""Bubble"" and in best Steve Jobs tradition, addresses his huge team from the ""launchatorium"" announcing their newest product - the ""B-bot"". A small, egg-shaped, gadget that is to become the best friend of every child. It will befriend them, know all about them, manage their social media accounts - do just about everything except eat for them. Soon, every kids wants one , has one - and they have become the norm. Except, that is, for ""Barney"" who lives with his father and his totally bonkers grandma, and whose dad is concerned that kids live too much of their lives vicariously through gadgets. Like so many parents, though, peer pressure ultimately forces their hand - and they buy him one on the black market (well, yes, it literally did fall off the back of a lorry!). It hasn't been pre-programmed like the gazillions of others, and so he ""Ron"" and ""Barney"" actually have to learn how to get to know one another. That's the source of many a light-hearted escapade as they begin to like, understand and trust each other whilst the boffins want to reclaim their errant android and squish him up before their share price goes the way of the dodo! The animation is colourful and well designed, and there is a smidgen of humour too, to keep the film moving along quickly and entertainingly. There are certainly quite a few poignant aspects to this: it does write large the worrying expansive culture of popularity, of always keeping up with - or surpassing - your frequently quite shallow (virtual) friends; and of the damage - both physical and psychological - that can be caused when these things go wrong. Also, it swipes fairly and squarely at corporate exploitation and greed - especially when it is directed at children, and at the laziness of the grown-ups who submit, meekly, to anything that makes life easier or less complicated, without the slightest awareness or appreciation of the potential consequences. The ending is a little bit cheesy, i felt - but there is entertainment a-plenty here with quite a strong message for those who paid for the tickets.",Ron's Gone Wrong
1884,2,kevin_robbins,It's far from a classic but it is well done and entertaining,7/10,15 November 2021,"Ron's Gone Wrong (2021) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a young boy named Barney that is an outcast due to not having the latest technology which has replaced cell phones and video games as entertainment and he doesn't have one. When his parents buy him one off market that has a few issues hijinks ensue.This movie is codirected by Sarah Smith (Arthur Christmas), Jean-Philippe Vine (Shaun the Sheep) and Octavio E. Rodriguez (The Epic Tale of Captain Underpants). This movie also contains the voices of Jack Dylan Grazer (IT), Ed Helms (The Hangover), Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) and Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz).The animation in this picture is excellent. The storyline was unique and had some great characters, lessons and scenarios. The plot is fun to watch unfold. The dialogue is very entertaining and the friendship conversations as it evolves throughout the movie is good. The action scenes, while often over the top, are fun and had my daughter laughing throughout the movie.Overall this is a slightly above average addition to the genre that's a fun family picture. It's far from a classic but it is well done and entertaining. I'd score this a 7/10 and recommend watching it once.",Ron's Gone Wrong

Jack is a middle school kid that is not very popular-he has no friends. A new personal robot-called 'bots'-is the new cell phone for the younger generation and every kid wants one. With these bots, they can text, talk, send videos & pictures.....etc. And they are a sign of status. They are marketed as being the new best friend to their juvenile owners. Jack does not have one. He keeps asking his father, Ed, for one and when he finally gets one, it is damaged and causes lots of back and forth struggles between it and Jack on their journey to find the true meaning of friendship. Zach voices the damaged bot, Ron and Olivia voices Jack's grandmother.It's rated PG for crude material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.I enjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD and the younger kids should enjoy it, too.",Ron's Gone Wrong
1886,4,pixrox1,This documentary masquerading as a kiddie flick . . .,8/10,26 October 2021,". . . blows the whistle upon Macro Hard Face Goo. RON'S GONE WRONG postulates that even if a benign genius thinker is among the founders of an incipient major social network or software corporation, irredeemable mercenary crooks inevitably will find a way to force the brains behind innovation OUT of the concern, and take the whole shebang over to the Dark Side. As has been documented in countless Sixty Minutes segments, news articles and books--sometimes with the cooperation of defecting corporate whistleblowers--this is EXACTLY what has happened time after time during the past few decades with the Real Life Lucifers now running Macro Hard Face Goo. How sad!",Ron's Gone Wrong
1887,5,rgkarim,Ron's Gone Right In Many Ways I Did Not Expect,8/10,23 October 2021,"LIKES:Great Pace:
Animated movies always fluctuate with balance issues and their gimmicks, often executing well and sometimes tipping one way over the other. Ron's Gone Wrong starts with a good pace that moves to be fun and engaging for younger audiences, but not so much to skip the deeper messages lying in wait. The movie handles transitions between the acts very well, each one having a decent amount of time, sticking to a realistic timeline, and still moving to never get lost in any gimmicks. It's a major source of the fun for me, and should be able to hold the fleeting attention of the modern generation.Animation:
It's not realistic, it's not groundbreaking, and it's not the most unique pallet to paint on, however Ron's group is certainly fun, cute, and animated well to bring the story to life. Ron's tale has a lot of dynamic movement between the robots that plague the world and the humans who use them and both elements are done extraordinarily well. Younger audiences should welcome the bubbly, rounded features of the world, and even the ""darker"" aspects are shaded to be less imposing for more sensitive viewers. Nevertheless, the dynamic stunts and adventures are gorgeous and filled with emotion as the more intense moments hit.The Voice Acting:
Nothing that hits the Oscar category, but certainly well done nonetheless to get the characters alive and past the simple digital representation. Jack Dylan Grazer hits the vulnerable teen well, a mixture of confusion and hurt that gradually evolves into a more mature role as the movie moves on past the simple adventure. Ed Helms is still excelling at the antagonistic role, and works well in the enunciation and mannerisms that seem to match the character on screen making for a simplistic character to throw a wrench in the gears. The star is Galifianakis though, whose voice of Ron is sensationally casted for the quirky robot struggling to boot up and perform his coding. Ron's style takes the ridiculousness of the actor, but manages to curb it into something tolerable and PG rated that works to be humorous. Even better, he also lends to more emotional moments, managing to never lose the robotic tone and delivery, and yet somehow instilling emotion to the level.The Presentation:
The movie is wonderful for helping to really deliver the powerful punches that the movie is trying to execute. The first two acts manage to be focused on the buildup, giving you the hurt and sting of the protagonist and the family's attempts to help him adapt into the new world. It's balanced between fun and drama, keeping a pace that is inviting to the attention of all ages. Then the third act starts to really dive into the fun, never dropping the drama or suspense, but focusing on the subtle moral lessons while keeping the fun. Then it's the final two acts that start to play around with the balance, never eliminating one or the other, but adding the tweaks to again get that presentation going. I loved the designs and close ups of those key moments, while utilizing other things like sound, music, and simple change of perspective to capture all of the moments needed.The Comedy:
Not the cleverest, and really not the most spread, but something about Ron's charm manages to make elements of the movie very funny for adults. Sure there is kid humor, all about using slap stick and quotable lines to have your little ones giggling in delight. Ron's lines in particular are reminiscent of technology gone wrong, mixed with childlike innocence and wonder, and mixed with just enough sarcasm and blunt humor to be very entertaining. Slapstick moments arise decently, and other elements integrated into the mix with other characters will touch other comedy moments lightly. It works well with the theme, being a staple without overcoming the other elements and I enjoyed it even if I was not on the floor laughing the whole time.The Story/Morals:
This is probably the strongest thing I latched onto in this movie, the story and the lessons tied with it. Barney's tale is relevant to this reviewer, not only in personal experiences, but in approaches to the modern trends and way of life that the last 7 years has brought. Feeling the social life being lost to the technology life is tough, and Barney's caught in between both that are combatting for the dominance in the world. Upon Ron's emergence, this tale really tries to highlight things that I think are important and what I try to do, which touches a lot of my heart strings and brought the fun out of the movie. As the relationship between the two protagonists evolves, the directors and animators try to up the game and in many senses I think hit the check boxes for that emotional punch we all need in these movies. Especially the ending where the climactic collision of all the stories works together to really deliver the finale we have been looking forward to all this time.DISLIKES:Predictable:
I never expected this to be the case of a surprise, but you always hope for something to blow your mind with these movies. In this case, the movie is very linear and predictable, taking suspense away because of how much I knew was coming. For most, this won't be an issue if they are having fun, but as a reviewer there is a little bit of tweaking to help get the story to engage to older audiences past the target audience age. Some plot holes also can get in the way of things at times, primarily when logic and security tend to be easily subverted to get the job done.The Character Usage:
I'm mixed on this because in truth they did do a nice job keeping many characters in the film, it's just that some of them really get dropped despite the hints they do in one scene. The climax suggested there would be a lot more involvement with some of the other kids and their talents, but that did not happen, and they were mostly used for some political moments rather than ingraining them into the tale. They are used quite powerfully, but I can't say that there is room for improvement to assist with the better development with some of the group.Ron can be a bit annoying:
This is a small tweak definitely, but the I have to admit that there are times when Ron's antics are a little too much. Primarily at the beginning when Barney is trying to get him set up, the writers tended to stray into the realm of a few jokes too far. It gets mitigated much more down the line, but there are a few times of going down the kid avenue over the adult humor.The Comedy:
Not perfect, but Ron's Gone Wrong could have used a little more adult humor to bring the adults in further. Again, it does not mean it has to go down the levels of derogatory humor, but 90's television and Shrek has proven you can be a little bolder with comedy and hide it from the kids. I would have liked that very much for helping break some things up instead.The Politics:
Yes, there is unfortunately some political preachiness in this film, and to the point of being a little in your face. However, I have to say it's not promoting the usual manners and was more acceptable than some of the other films I've seen in the past (looking at you Charlie's Angels 2019). But, the messages in Ron's about friendship vs. Technology may rub people the wrong way depending on which way you swing in the era of Social Media vs Social Networking with people. I think Ron does a nice job mitigating it if you stick with it, but it can be hard given some of the in your face symbolism and lines. This may be the part that will drive more people away, primarily due to the challenges of change and taking steps back from technology that can get in the way of fun.The VERDICT:
Ron's Gone Wrong may not be the movie of the year for Academy Awards compared to movies like Soul. Yet this movie should not be ignored or destroyed because it does not go down the ""progressive"" or unique edge in terms of what Disney can do. However, the movie has a lot of heart to it, really exploring avenues that socially awkward people like myself can learn, take comfort in, and hopefully get some lessons to others for surviving in this world. I loved the buddy comedy, had a blast with the pacing and design, and really felt some great moments in the story piece of the film. True, there are plot gaps and predictability, and the character usage is a bit lacking, leaning towards woke symbolism and hyperbole than true integration. In addition, there are also some heavy handed preaching components that my generation and onward may be turned off on given the approach to life we take. Yet, Ron's journey is a lot of fun, and really does a nice job of walking a balanced line of fun, story, and lessons that I really think is not being represented in the advertising and reviews. Thus, this movie I encourage people to take a look at and potentially be surprised and entertained like I was. My scores for this film are:Animated/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0

1888,6,rannynm,"The Challenges of being a middle schooler, including wanting to fit in, are universal",10/10,31 October 2021,"Ron's Gone Wrong is an outstanding animated film, written by Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith. It really connects with its audience through funny jokes and loveable characters, while also delivering the important message that no matter how kids present themselves, especially in middle school, they all are experiencing similar challenges and feelings. This message is very important, especially for young kids and teens to hear, and Ron's Gone Wrong brings this theme to light.The storyline follows a socially awkward middle schooler named Barney (Jack Dylan Grazer), who is ostracized because he does not own the hottest new piece of tech -- a B-bot, or a digitally connected ""Best Friend Out of the Box."" That changes when his grandmother and father surprise him for his birthday with his very own B-bot, although this B-bot is a bit different than what he expected.The film is critical of social media replacing friendships in real life and the potential of tech companies to violate people's privacy. One of the characters has an embarrassing image of her go viral through her B-bot, resulting in her feeling embarrassed and being unable to take it down. Ron's Gone Wrong has a very talented, all-star cast. Jack Dylan Grazer's portrayal of Barney makes him believable and relatable as a middle school outcast. Another hilarious cast member is Zach Galifianakis, who voices the defective B-bot, Ron. He cracks me up and makes this movie so funny. Director Octavio Rodriguez creates a vibrant, colorful animation style that brings these characters to life - especially the B-bots, but also the goat and chicken that belong to Barney's grandmother who is from ""the old country.""The primary message is that the challenges of being a middle schooler, including wanting to fit in and make friends, are universal. There is also a critical message about the danger of too much technology and its impact on kids and the world. Parents should know there is some animated violence when Ron goes after Barney's bullies, but overall, the film is very positive.I give Ron's Gone Wrong 5 out 5 stars and I highly recommend it for ages 9 to 18, plus adults. I love this movie and believe you will too. You can watch Ron's Gone Wrong in theaters October 21, 2021. By Samantha B., KIDS FIRST!",Ron's Gone Wrong

1890,8,Movi3DO,Not bad,7/10,22 October 2021,"Ron: ""Are you my best friend?"" Oh damn.Being alone in the theater was a blessing because I was able to laugh out loud with this one. The story was super formulaic with concrete acts and turning points. The theme was nothing new and felt redundant.However, I adored the relationship between the main kid Barney and the malfunctioning bebot Ron. They cracked me up multiple times. The more I watched, the more I became invested in their relationship.Overall, it's a movie that you have seen many times before, but the strong and sweet relationship between the two main characters made this worth a watch. 7.5/10.

1893,11,statuskuo,A Mediocre Flick,6/10,1 November 2021,"I'm old enough to remember artificial intelligence being questioned. ""Short Circuit"", for example, tackled this idea long before it could even be acknowledge. And for the most part, it gave the more positive spin to inanimate objects learning to be ""more human"" ""Short Circuit"" didn't shy from wanting Johnny 5 to have a soul. Ron is perfectly fine staying a program that attempts to save itself in the final 10 minutes of the film.In this case, Ron is a programmed A. I. that is designed to be more of a information analyzer. Or at least absorb everything about a middle school aged child and reguritate the idea of being a friend. A solid concept, to be sure.Where Ron goes wrong is that there is a LOT of misplaced judgement of the future. For instance, a very sophisticated bot being all things to everyone, all the time. We see these as an extension pet of a child but never do see these in the hands of adults. Alexa and Siri would be insulted. Here it monitors all activity and uses an algorithm to pretend to be a friend. Much like Teddy Ruxpin, in terms of a sense of interaction. But never really engaged.So of course we need a hip young mind to promote and program such a thing and a money grubbing Steve Jobs like character to play the villain to exploit such a miracle. Ron is the outlier. A broken beaten bot whose malfunction will obviously give him the insight needed to change things. It does get tedious. Mostly because we know what the issues are. The preaching of tech being evil has run its course. As I'm sure the makers had their hearts in the right place. Tech was made to better our lives but made us much more distant. The movie offers no solution. Only a glimpse that we need to re-focus our reliance of using tech to be less distant to humanity. Small steps, I suppose.A mid-range look at these things. Especially when Barney (lead characters) world of humanity consists of a nebbish father and a annoying grandmother.",Ron's Gone Wrong

PG
director: Sarah Smith and Jean Phillipe Divine.Starring: Jack Dylan Grazer, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Olivia Colman, Rob Delaney, Justice Smith, Kylie Cantrall, Ricardo Hurtado etcThe story of Barney, an awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally connected device. Ron's malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age launch them on a journey to learn about true friendship. Ron's gone wrong was ok and fine for what it was.My first few positives would be the strong animation and set up. As well as the great worldbuilding and interesting elements. Also, the likeable characters, humour, and interesting family dynamic. The film was visually stunning with a rich storyworld and aesthetically pleasing set locations, also with impressive animation for the characters that looked realistic but also unique to some other animations. I also thought the set-up of introducing the B bots and what their function were intrigued me and was a strong start to the film. The worldbuilding itself was also strong, with the film going into great amounts of details about the b bots and their function and building and expanding on the world with the character or Ron, it had layers to it and didn't feel one dimensional so was always invested in the world the characters were in. I also thought the characters were very likeable. Barney had this loveable charm to him as a character and he was easy to sympathise and connect with and I feel like his character can be relatable to a lot of people watching. Especially younger kids who perhaps feel the same as his character. I also loved the family dynamic. Him losing his mother and never building the relationship with his dad gave some interesting themes and depth, and the comedic chemistry with the grandmother was always fun to watch. The films humour especially with the grandmother and the weird and wonderful situations Barney got into with Ron got some good laughs.My first few negatives are the generic plot elements. The repetitive humour and forced dialogue. As well as the pacing issues. The film recycled a lot of plot points and themes from other movies and this kind of movie has been done before and done better. A film like the Mitchell's vs the machines comes to mind. I also thought not all the humour landed. The film was inconsistent and went very repetitive with some of the jokes. They lost their impact after a certain number of times and it became slightly tedious and annoying hearing the same joke multiple times. I also thought a lot of the dialogue felt very corny and forced. Particularly with a lot of the characters and how they interact with Barney. It just felt very unrealistic and generic with why the kids were being mean to him and the dialogue shined a light on this. I also thought the pacing was very messy. The film was too chaotic and was moving at such a fast pace but with a surprising lack of plot. So, it missed opportunities for more depth as it constantly wanted to move onto new things and just threw everything at you, so it lacked focus.My final few positives would be the strong themes and charming tone. As well as the chemistry between the characters and heart-warming moments. And the villain was strong with an entertaining and uplifting final act. I think the themes on friendship and family, as well as making relationships in the real world and not creating a fake version of yourself was strong and very important. This film also had a very charming tone, the chemistry and friendship between Ron and Barney was very sweet as they grew their friendship and they both learned from each other, and it was a heart-warming highlight of the film. They both had such a great chemistry with each other and as Ron learned more about Barney the more emotionally connected Barney felt to something as he grew to accept himself. I also thought the villain was strong, the themes that the villain helped highlight were strong. Highlighting the need for security and controlled screen time especially when they are kids, and how horrible the villain was with the invasion of the kid's privacy helped to highlight this. Finally, I thought the final act was uplifting and entertaining. The final act was the strongest part of the film for me. It was heart-warming with Barney finally feeling accepted and his arc with his family was very touching and well done. It was entertaining and visually stunning and offered a great message that ended the film on a high note.My final few negatives would be the lack of development and stakes. As well as the odd character decisions. For me the film really lacked any plot or development for a good chunk of the run time. It felt like it was more of a series repetitive plot points that weren't going anywhere. And with a lack of a strong villain until the second half, for a while the film just wasn't going anywhere. This impacted the pacing and the quality of the writing. There was also just a complete lack of stakes, there was no real sense of danger for a large portion of the film, it felt like it wasn't challenging itself or the characters enough, therefore limiting the amount of development the plot and characters could have. I also thought that there were some odd creative decisions with the characters. I found it very strange that the film spent so long having characters like Savannah and Rich bully Barney for so long, only for them to suddenly be friends with him, it just felt very odd and I found it hard to believe the characters would change their point of view on each other so quickly.Overall, Ron's gone wrong has strong animation, A loveable lead duo. And raises some good themes, its heart was in the right place. But the thinly written and recycled plot as well as a general feeling of playing it too safe impacted my enjoyment considerably. It was serviceable and families will enjoy it, but I don't think I will be watching it again.Overall rating 62/100.",Ron's Gone Wrong
1895,13,coombsstephen,Good animation film although with a slightly odd twist,7/10,23 October 2021,"I really enjoyed this film, the characters are good, and cross over well for adult viewers, and the plot is modern and quite on point.The film is funny, absorbing and goes at a good pace.All I found odd was the main company in the film was obviously aimed at a certain technology company and the villain in the film seemed to be directly aimed at a a person who has long passed away and was not a villain in most people's eyes.

It is clear that modern technology is emphasized here, so it seems relevant. The film has a few good moments and jokes that made me laugh. Maybe it takes a little too long for the kids and some scenes probably needed to be shortened so it would last shorter and get on quality. The lesson of the film is a good, solid film for children.

It wants to imply that social networks and technology companies can steal our privacy, but I think the message is directed towards parents not to introduce their children to technology from an early age. Other things do not finish materializing, such as the message of feeling belonged and lonely, or that a friend can be totally different from you. The film is full of conveniences that favor the protagonist. The highlights are the animation and the development of some characters.The film fails when trying to convey many messages through many subplots that do not finish materializing, just as I think this film could seem a bit boring for children, although it can be a bit emotional due to the theme of friendship.",Ron's Gone Wrong

This experience was just so that my brother could have a good time and enjoy himself.And yet by the end of the film, I found myself in awe.

The general theme of friendship is so wholesome and the characters are well rounded. Even the villain was surprisingly great. He wasn't some mindless psycho wanting take over the world. He was a greedy owner of a successful company that cared more about the profits than the consumers. Sound like any companies we know?

And..., yeah it was good, a good film that is indeed a good start, but not without a few minor complaints, so let's talk about it.First off the animation is quite impressive, there is a certain style and colour to it that looks rather extraordinary, the characters have a distinct cartoony design to them that I quite admire, the textures are nicely rendered, the B*Bots are wildly creative in how they look and move, it's very impressive and quite imaginative, I like the music too especially Henry Jackman's score and the song Sunshine by Liam Payne, the characters are easy to like even if they are cliched stereotypes, especially Ron (Zach Galifianakis) who is lovable and Barney (Jack Dylan Grazer) who is relatable in every way, thanks to the very solid voice acting, they carry the comedy and the drama rather well also, the story does have it's good heart and even stronger comedy, with also sweet moments that are quite admirable like i was surprised by how funny this film was, the film does get even more interesting and the steaks get bigger as it goes along, I like the ending a lot as it does fulfil the film's concept and message.However there are a couple of things that are as wrong as Ron, like the movie has quite the cliches in it's story and it's quite predictable for the most part, that and the animation looks very similar to something like Arthur Christmas (hence Sarah Smith's involvement) heck Barney looks like him and Andrew (Rob Delaney) looked like Steve and Ron looked like Baymax, it also looks similar to Mitchells Vs. The Machines not just because of Olivia Colman's Involvement, the bully character can be annoying at times, also there are a few moments of very poor attempts to make fart jokes funny and it still doesn't work, I don't get it..., it's not very funny.So yeah I did enjoy this movie for quite a bit and it was a good start for this animation studio, Ron's Gone Wrong is a enjoyable family animated feature that anyone can watch of any age, with it's impressive animation, a nice heart and message, a decently written story, likeable enough characters, very good voice acting, great comedy and a cool concept, but the silly moments of toilet humour, as to be expected cliches and easy to predict story doesn't give this film quite the magnum opus that LockSmith needs in a way, it's still a good animated movie that I can see everyone enjoying and remembering, but hey it's not perfect, so check it out when it comes out in the US, I certainly wish the best of luck to Locksmith for more potentially great animated features in the future!I'm going to give Ron's Gone Wrong a 7.9/10.",Ron's Gone Wrong

1907,25,nlgthunder,Hilarious and sentimental,8/10,3 November 2021,"Too bad this movie isn't getting more buzz. The animation was really good, the concept is extremely relevant, it's enjoyable for all age levels, it's funny, as well as really emotional.Some parts were a little on the nose, but this is a kid's movie after all. I think the story was written in a way that many kids will be able to relate to. The theme of not fitting in, being left out when it comes to gadgets, and being ""on the outside looking in"" are all extremely relevant.The comedy aspect of Ron's Gone Wrong was well paced and we'll delivered, the sentiment was strong, and this movie was definitely enjoyable.

1908,26,benjaminskylerhill,I cried.,8/10,4 November 2021,"The story is too scatterbrained and the humor sometimes too juvenile, but these are minor complaints because this movie has FAR more emotional weight than I could have expected from it.The two main characters are more relatable than most characters in live-action films. The story's themes of toxic social media use and the vapid nature of digital-age friendship are incredibly mature and hard-hitting when the film actually focuses on them.This was an unexpected gem. Plus, it got several genuine laughs out of me. Hats off.

1909,27,bostonct,It's a nice movie.....,8/10,14 November 2021,"Very formula, typical middle school angst movie that starts and ends just like any other middle school film. It's actually reasonable well done with a few chuckles here and there. Good movie to watch in an afternoon. If you're over 15, please keep in mind when you go into the theater to expect (and and judge) this movie for what it is, a middle school movie, and not what you think it should be. You'll enjoy it much more.

My 6 year old was bored, never connected to the story line from the start, and we left within 20 minutes or so.But we did enjoy the popcorn and candy while we were there...

1911,29,sheppard-2,Could be a masterpiece of not the ending,7/10,27 November 2021,"Up to about 3/4 of the movie, this is a masterpiece. Authentic, original, humorous, empathic, cool. But then it suddenly turns into a standard nonsense mass produced happy end story that doesn't stick well to what happened before it. Well, not without style or charm, but still much weaker than the first 3/4 of the film. If not that, if they kept being as bold with the ending as they were with the rest of the movie, I could easily give it a nine. The ending itself could earn a five.

Another cliché element.Then at the end. This movie just reverse uno everything. The characters (even though they are just elementary students) are already acting so superficial.It's not even fun to watch. Just a self absorbed kid that doesn't learn his lesson.Only reason why this movie isn't 1 star is cause of the easter eggs *cough* Disney bought Fox and the meta jokes.

1913,31,nebukanezer,My 8 year old rated this,6/10,24 October 2021,Took my 8 year old son and he gives it a 6.Basically he thought Ron was mostly annoying (so did I) and not particularly funny. He definitely did not have any desire to have a Ron (a broken b bot) but was more interested in one of the functioning ones. So the totally unoriginal message here definitely did not make any impact on him. He mostly enoyed it though.. hence the 6.I personally thinks he's spot on in his judgement of Ron. Why Barney laughs at or enjoys any of the extremely annoying stuff Ron does in the movie beats me. I would also prefer one of the functioning ones.I'll chip on also to add that the story is 80% unoriginal and 100% predictable. This could only be made in the US. I would give a 4 - but since this is primarily a kids movie I'll let my son Oscar provide his score!,Ron's Gone Wrong

I'm a forty year old dude, no kids, just like to see something fun and I found myself laughing all the way through. The interaction between Ron and Barney was really well done. Definitely give this one a watch.And I see in some reviews people are saying this is woke. I have no idea what movie they were watching. I'm scratching my head trying to figure out what they're talking about. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone and really does have a good all around message.

That is somewhere between probably and maybe not. If you are spoiled (like me) with great animation...then not. If you are an average movie goer probably yes.

Normally companies that try to pander to young people are pretty trash at this (The Emoji Movie). But I can happily say I was WAY wrong lmao. This movie is a masterpiece. I found my friends and I borderline screeching at the theater and laughing out loud for nearly every scene, along with feeling the heavy emotional toll and weight the movies core message presents, about the absence of personal connection in our online lives and the impersonal way companies try to appeal to and take advantage of consumers.This movie is beautiful. Best animated film I've seen in literally years. I recommend it 1,000 times over for kids, families, adults, whoever.

This movie was filled with bad jokes, nothing funny, one single person laughed in the whole theater, no one knew what her problem was.It bored me to death, but 1 out of 3 of my kids liked it so we had to sit through all of it, the other 2 were completely bored, asking me to leave by the half of the movie.

I love how dynamics the script was while at the same time maintaining a childhood vulnerability that was relatable to all age groups. It highlights how the next generation is coexisting with technology and how it now defines us.

In addition to being very funny and super, its design conveys a very important message. Thank you for presenting the negative effects of social media and technology that have a significant impact on our daily lives and mental health. Thank you for alleviating the depression of countless young people through the film.

1945,2,samxxxul,ENTERTAINING BRAIN TEASER: VP Repeats MANKATHA Magic For STR,7/10,25 November 2021,"Maanaadu is a feast of sound, vision, even taste. It is noteworthy that Venkat Prabhu tells a complex sci-fi story, but it is completely plausible with a good first half of being confronted with a film whose plot one can predict after a while, only to be confronted a little later with twists and turns that were simply KICKASS. You could say that halfway through as it makes you anticipate for an interval bang and the film does a U-turn which pays off.Venkat Prabhu shows the power dynamics and how corrupt people incite violence in the name of religion and the depths of the human mind where terrifying creatures can hide. But what makes the film so interesting: The irony with which the he proceeded here with his writing for SJ Suryah (Dhanuskodi) whose over the top antics is fun to watch supported by Simbu's (Abdul Khaaliq) excellent performance and it is commendable to see him experiment shedding his mass hero image. The conflict fits in harmoniously and with disastrous consequences in the event and challenging their own fate. They both hold the plot together and it is the beginning and the end and it repeats (maybe Part 2).The editing deserves a special mention here, so expect a break neck pace and whiplash sequences which keeps the 2nd half in a tense zone,
It is supported with terrific soundtrack by Yuvan Shankar Raja (whoever saw the film will understand that).Conclusion: It has a unique vision, and VP stages scenes in an interesting way to express the tug-of-war and i'm sure it will cater to all types of audiences. This film contains all the things that an audience would expect to make it a pure entertaining and HOOT worthy watch.",Maanaadu

Language: Tamil
RECOMMENDEDThe time loop concept is regionalised superbly. They added nice mass masala and the repeated scenes are handled cleverly.Its definitely the comeback movie for both STR and VP. And cherry on the top is SJ Surya. I cant imagine anyone on his Role. He is so comic and con at the same time.After second half the sequences between STR and SJ are high level entertainment points of the movie...
it has its own drawback also like templated time loop sequences, bit slow pace in the first half and bit lengthy action sequences...
Still the movie is entertaining to the core.Worth the watch.",Maanaadu
1948,5,TreeFiddy53,A Tamil movie unlike any other in the recent past!,8/10,26 November 2021,"I went into this movie with 0 expectations, and it was SO MUCH better than I thought it would be.People have tried different things in Kollywood in past with little success, while this different attempt deserves credit, if the movie is bad, it's just bad. But Tamil audience gets up in arms about the bad reviews and says ""You'd watch the exact same concept in a Hollywood movie, but you trash it in Kollywood? You're anti-national!"" LMAOwut?THIS is how those movies should have panned out. Glad that the general Tamil audience has something to compare the deservedly trash movies to. Shoutout to Venkat Prabhu for trying something different and actually pulling it off really well.I can't believe I'm saying this but Simbu, SJ Surya did a great job, however, the writing and editing steal the show. This bold script could have ended up being trash, but faaar from it. You, of course, have to suspend some disbelief (which you need to do for Hollywood movies as well) and this movie will keep you engaged, from start to finish. No mirch masala, no drama. No duets and unnecessary songs and dances; overall a no-nonsense movie, the likes of which you've not watched in Tamil cinema for a while.Watch this in the theaters to really be immersed, especially for Yuvan Shankar Raja's music.",Maanaadu

The screenplay and direction very awesome.The first half is powerful and awesome while second half is excellent and innovative. Yuvan music and BGM mass and powerful.Made on a budget of 30 crore, Maanaadu got extremely positive response from critics and audiences. I think the movie might be the highest grossing film in Simbu career and first 100 crore movie like Doctor which is Sivakarthikeyan first 100 crore movie.Thus, Maanaadu will become one of best Tamil films of 2021 and it was a must watch.

1957,14,vibhus-17780,Time loop plus politics.....,7/10,25 November 2021,"Time loop concept was very well handled with good entertaining elements . Venkat Prabhu done a good job in his script writing , especially time loop concept in politics was something new and interesting . Only two characters shined in the movie , Abdul Khaaliq and Dhanushkodi , both the characters were very well handled by Simbhu and SJ Surya's performance . It was good that they didn't placed any song after Meherezylaa song ( I excepted Voice of Unity song at end credits ) . Asusual terrific BGM from Yuvan . 1st half it took some time for the story to pickup and 2nd half was really good . They could've avoided some spoon feeding in movie . We can notice that Venkat Prabhu's making style got bit dull nowadays , but that didn't affect the movie much . Overall a well made time loop concept with politics and entertainment , something new and good watch for family audience .

1959,16,sleodeepak,Maanaadu is a supremely entertaining high-concept movie,10/10,25 November 2021,"Even though the Maanadu is shade of Vantage Point and A day (Korean movie), this screenplay is completely new and Its such a new concept in Tamil industry. Worth watch movie. Fantastic 1st Half & Excellent 2nd Half. STR's Performance is ultimate, the energy and charisma that made him a beloved star. Great comback for STR. SJ Suryah is terrific in this role that calls him to act his heart out. Amazing performance from S J Suryah. Venkat Prabhu superbly Indianises the time loop concept and delivers an edge-of-the-seat masala movie. Yuvan Shankar Raja elevates the momentum of the scenes & BGM next Level, he incredibly earwormy Maanaadu theme and a theme that he uses for SJ Surya. Technically brilliant. Climax and Screenplay are extra plus. Last 20 mins is fantastic. MUST WATCH Entertaining Movie.

1967,24,ramsoundareswaran,A cracking comeback for both STR and Venkat Prabhu.,7/10,25 November 2021,"Both STR's and Venkat Prabhu's careers really needed a home run for them to stay relevant and 'Maanadu' is exactly that. The film takes on Time Loop as it's central conceit and weaves a taut screenplay that seldom drags. Once we're past the generic first 15 minutes the film just takes off into a nail-biting thriller. It keeps on building and most of the twists work really well. It's not necessarily a new concept to Hollywood (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow) but is definitely a novelty for Tamil mainstream. The story needs a dangerous but wildly entertaining villain for it to work and who better to do it than SJ Suryah. His enjoyably exaggerated performances over time have made me think that he might be the Jim Carrey of Tamil cinema. There are some 'laugh out loud' moments involving him and YG Mahendran, who was solid. Yuvan gives a typically driving score that keeps up with the film's pace. All in all VP has successfully blended high concept into a tight masala screenplay to deliver one hell of an entertainer.

The story is extremely gripping. STR has made a genuine comeback after several years with his acting and screen presence. Yuvan has one of his top scores in this film. This can be STR s and SJ Suryah s Magnum Opus. It is a new successfully accomplished experiment. It also is thought provoking on the social issues such as communal riots etc.Overall this film is an absolute blockbuster and breathtaking to watch.Hellfire.

1970,27,willgrimes,Average and logically weak,5/10,26 November 2021,"The concept of timeloop has been handled very well because of the editing.congrats to the editor.dialogue writing is not upto mark for a sci-fi movie.director VP doesn't seem have put hardwork to the dialogues which would have escalated the scenes to the serious levels.comedy is not seen anywhere...may be people from 70's may have laught for the jokes of Premji and Karunakaran.those charecters don't stick to the movie. I couldn't even have sympathy when the hero cries for those charecters are getting killed, may have chosen some better actors for the roles...And there are lot of logics mistakes and goofs in the movie like the villain also gets stuck in timeloop when hero's blood cells transferred via blood stream when their body wounds get contact with each other. Hero is shown as a vip in the intro so that a politician gets fooled by hero and his friends so easily eventho there is nothing shown or said how influential the hero is. In the end the villain who is frustrated by hero's act of trying to destroy his cruel plan against innocent people, tries to kill the CM and the hero inside the memorial house after telling all the plans to heroCM and his son instead of killing CM right away or killing the hero restart the day. Not a perfect sci-fi to watch.",Maanaadu
1971,28,rafathsiraj,"""#Maanadu"" A Come back for Actor Simbu. My Review",9/10,28 November 2021,"""#Maanadu"" A Come back for Actor Simbu. My ReviewFilm Maanadu produced by Suresh Kamatchi, Music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and starring Simbu definitely a brake through for Simbu who was terribly in need of one Hit movie, Mr. Venkat Prabhu beautifully carved a different story line as a time loop thriller and presented in a highly enjoyable and crowd-pleasing way'Maanadu' is a political sci-fi thriller, Simbu arrives to Coimbatore for a friend's wedding and in the flight he meets Kalyani Priyadarshan who is scared of flight journey and Simbu wants to kidnap the bride as his friend falls in love with her, but he encounters Assistant Commissioner SJ Surya and he handovers an assignment to Kill the CM during a 'Maanadu' and when Simbu dies the day repeats again in a loop. He needs to pass the day or save the chief minister in order to walk out of this loop. A different level of screenplay penned and directed by Venkat Prabhu, edited by Praveen KL.and Back ground music by Yuvan supported by action Director Stunt Silva, the manner in which Venkat prabhu directed the film with famous actors keep the boredom aside which strikes at one point when re-watching the same scenes seen.Simbu has outshined in his performance after losing lot of weight, he is cheerful, refreshing, all impressive throughout the film after a long time, he scores in emotional as well as in action scenes, he brassed his unused acting weapons from his armoury brilliantly, promises a blockbuster comeback for his fans, by slightly touching the Politics with simple but punch lines. His acting is so elegant and mature and proves he is the man who shows a huge mass by the entry on the screen after a long hiatus, specially he exhibits physical fitness while his fast-running chase scene at Airport.SJ Surya, the antagonist of the film, the screen ignites as soon as the man arrives, does the same thing as Time Loop happens to Simbu, SJ Surya literally scores every frame he appears and his body language where he evokes villainism with humour is too good. He makes us enjoy the scenes with his elegant body language and verses in his own style. Rather than being the other hero of the film, he has aggressively expressed his assault acting to the extent that he can be said to be the hero of the film.Another hero of the film is Yuvan Shankar Raja's background music. Yuvan has given some super hit materials with proper tunes, both different BGMs he is providing for Simbu and SJ Surya is fire for fans to be sure to come back and watch the film again and again. Yuvan has vividly embroidered BGM for the hero in way and another way for the protagonist in appreciable manner which is Yuvan's brand to keep the hype of the filmThe first half moves at a leisure place and the real show begins in second half which is carrying a lot of inceptions as it is the first political time loop movie in Tamil which is not so familiar to Tamil Audience before. Selecting a story line with Time loop concept is just like walking on a rope, but Venkat Prabhu triumphed in giving a jolly entertainment film to be seen with the family, time loop concept was perfectly screened by top notch brilliant editing, not boring while showcasing the same incidents again and again. The showdown between the hero and villain will be unique and strong with exhilarating sound effects by Yuvan Shankar Raja's stylish background score.Captain of the crew, director Venkat Prabhu is credited with the overall success of the film, who has taken a very complex, challenging story which goes steady pace from start and filmed it in a way that makes sense by doing well in the screenplay without causing any confusion anywhere thereby proving once again that he is an elite director.In brief, Simbu simply strikes back with Venkat Prabhu.",Maanaadu

And no irritating comedy sequence.I love the concept time loop.Even It is better than many hollywood time loop moviesOnly based on story....
That also timeloop mixed political thrillerThis is the best best best tamil movie and tamil movie concept I ever watched.It
You can say I'm overrating.But beleive I'm a general audience which means if a movie is good then I will say good.But for this movie I will give 11 out of 10 stars.Time loop concept is scifi and a new concept to Indian cinema.So If tamil cinema do movies like this then it will be great .Till these days I got frustrated by love and action and normal political movies.Frankly I got irritated an frustrated. But I believe this movie will change something new in tamil industry
Atleast this same team will give different movie for us.And you know I watched movie today and again Im going for 2nd to theater to watch this movie in theater
Because of screenplay and act and thrill sequence and mainly for story concept💥💥
Now I will put one overrated comment. But the movie deserves it:
It will be best movie for me

Now

2042,0,subxerogravity,"It was real formulated, but that formula works!",8/10,27 November 2021,"This was so formulated; it would not surprise me if a computer wrote the script.The protagonist got hit hard by life and is force to find finical gain in crime ""but I'm gonna get out once my finical situation is good"", sure (rolling eyes), but the film is called For the Love of Money so you know, easier said than done.But for real, Kerri Hilson was way easy on the eyes, which made it very likeable to watch her play the protagonist in this By-the-numbers movie (She was not so good that I did not notice that every dude in this flick is like half her size (is she really that tall?).I've seen DC Young Fly do better. I'll give him credit, I'm use to seeing him do comedies and this was a more of a drama, and it just did not fully fit this time.But you know who did kill it? Katt Williams. If there was an award for special guest star who does a couple of scenes for a weeks' worth of work and gets paid the big bucks so they can put him on the Straight to DVD box and say he's in the movie, than Katt Williams just won that (unless Bruce Willis came out with a movie this year (He's the master of it). Kat was eating up all the scenes and blew it away. Loved everything about seeing him in this movie, one hundred percent.Also want to give the movie credit for the melodrama. It was laid out pretty well considering it was a movie not a TV show, which has more time to make the emotional connections this movie had to do in like two hours. (Ironically, those emotional connections made it easier to see loop holes in the story).This would be a good time to give a shout out to Lisa Raye who showed some real acting chops as a supporting thespian. She way to young and hot to be playing a grandma, but she put her all into it and she was not stingy with her acting position, which was just to movie the story along, and she did it like an Oscar winner.At this point I should mention Keith Sweat, whose overblown cameo was used just to move the soundtrack along.Overall, I enjoyed this movie.

Keeping that judgement aside, Sushin Shyam has done top notch work in the sound space. The songs are also good.Cinematically, the movie scores on multiple fronts. Color grading is excellent. Period set designs have been nicely done. Costumes have been good. Cinematography has been excellent. At the start of the movie, there were a few jerky edits but did not feel any further issues after the titles rolled in. Title work has also been good.Dulqar's screen presence has been great while the performances of pretty much all the actors have been flawless. Shine Tom Chacko's performance stands out for the convincing portrayal of a deranged.There are a few points where the director's earlier movie ""Second Show"" plays in.Writing has been pretty good. The structure has been carefully built out and makes for an entertaining watch from a story line perspective. A slow burner, the story draws you in nicely and takes you to nice twists. The script does not blow your mind - but nicely done. To some extent, a predictable line.Making scores over the script.The movie is a stylish anti-hero slow burner best enjoyed in a theatre.",Kurup
2044,1,ahamedmn,TREAT FOR DQ FANS❤,9/10,19 November 2021,"A slow burner which delivered perfectly. Dulquer salmaan done a excellent performance. Every characterization was potrayed beautifully. The Backgroundscore was the main pillar of the movie. Visuals were too good.

Before release, it was said that they will not glorify murder or glorify Kurup- they said they will give respect to Charles (person who got murdered). But none of it happened. Film glorifies Kurup as well as his murder. Film fail to portray murder as bad and instead go on to glorify murder.IF YOU ARE A KERALITE, YOU ALREADY KNOW THE STORY:
Film doesn't offer anything new. Neither direction nor acting was good. Having already know the story makes you yawn the full time throughout the film.Not worth spending money in theater- money and time waste. Should have released in OTT itself.Below average.

Tamil dubbing wasn't convincing for me . Dulquer Salmaan performance was good , not only him other cast also done great job with their performance . Technical team contributed very well , Cinematography and Art work were great . Music was good . There are some surprising cameos in movie . Overall with this crime thriller story they could've done better and interesting , but atlast a decent movie . Don't expect much . A good treat for DQ fans .

2054,11,arjunrajkss,Not worth it,4/10,12 November 2021,"I booked an evening show ticket knowing that movie is good by the initial reviews. I wonder whether they are paid up reviews or fan boys reviews. First half was too slow. I was patiently waiting because most of the Malayalam movies start slow at first but then it will be picked up in the second half. But Kurup was exceptional that even the second half didn't impress me much. But yeah, second half was better than the first half. Revealing everything in the climax works only if the entire plot is interesting. But Kurup was utter disappointment for me. I noticed many of the details are missing. In the final scene, it was first shown as he was caught but he escapes. They didn't show how he did despite being caught red-handed. I didn't had much expectations but I just wanted a satisfaction of logging off early from work was worth it. Not worth it.

2055,12,tkmce2008,Dulquer & Shine Tom Chacko dazzle in this partly fictionalised biopic,9/10,16 November 2021,"Everybody knows the story of Sukumara Kurup. He is India's most wanted fugitive, who has been missing since 1984. He is wanted for orchestrating the murder of Chacko and faking his own death to claim the life insurance sum in his name. The film narrates his life from the eyes of three people; his colleague at the Indian Air Force, his wife, his brother-in-law/accomplice in the murder & finally in Kurup's own word (fictionalised segment).Starring Dulquer Salmaan in the lead as the infamous Kurup, this biopic (which is mostly fictional due to lack of source material) lives up to all the hype. The non-linear narrative is used to good effect with the blanks in the story getting filled like jigsaw pieces at the end. It also boasts of top notch production value; the 70s & 80s are brought to life with pinpoint accuracy.Dulquer aces the cunning Kurup; who goes by Sudhakara Kurup in the film (all names have been changed in the film). Dulquer's version for the character is charming and at the same time malicious. Now, we all know where to find a dashing villain when we need one. Shine Tom Chacko, who plays Kurup's brother-in-law, is the other standout. He nails the perpetually drunk Bhasi Pillai, who aids Kurup in the murder. Sobhita Dhulipala plays Kurup's wife. You feel for her character because she is not aware of her husband's actions but stands by him throughout. Indrajith Sukumaran, Sunny Wayne, Actor Bharath, Shivajith co-star with Tovino Thomas & Anupama Parameswaran in cameos.Kurup excels on all fronts including the highly fictionalised last segment (because no one knows his story). There is even a sequel in the offing (which is unnecessary). But apart from that, Kurup is an excellent recreation of India's most wanted fugitive with Dulquer & Tom Shine Chacko in excellent form.",Kurup
2056,13,aravindnanda,Hype killed this one,4/10,13 November 2021,"Kurup has nothing new to offer. Ott release would've been better. Absolutely not worth risking your life in cinemas during the pandamic. The hype isn't real! It's not what they advertised it to be. Was a mockery to pull audiences back to theatres.Kurup is only an average 2.something hours stretched flick with repeating scenes, flamboyant dialogues, colourful shots and the ""geniuses"" of Mr. Kurup. First half was a pain to sit through. The writer's imagination is filled with loopholes. Better watch on Netflix.Pros - Cinematography, props, soundtracks, costumes, Shine Tom Chacko
Cons - Dialogues, sreenplay, story, duration.

2057,14,dipin-bt_86,DB REVIEW...Kurup a well executed crime drama ...,8/10,12 November 2021,"Saw the movie Kurup yesterday night .a well executed crime drama .the story is based on the notorious Sukumara kurup case which is still not closed by the kerala police .The movie revolves around kurup from his early days in airforce ,his love life ,to the area where the criminal in him is shown . Kurup is wonderfully created crime drama. The story is in non linear pattern. It moves around as an investigative drama shedding Lights to his life and the crimes and followings.Do did well as kurup. There are seasoned changes him in as an actor from his early days as kurup in air force to the way the criminal in him rises. The looks changes voice modulation changes.he has executed the character well .Shine tom chacko ..what an actor.he is superb in his role .he simply steals the scenes he were in.terrific performance
The direction of the movie is top notch. The era is created beautifully. The scenes where they show the persia is superb. The bgm is superb .congrats to sushin sham. The bgm has a kind of negative element in hit works well for the movie . Art direction is superb . Good editing .overall this is a perfect crime drama portraying the life of one of the most notorious kurup. The movie shows many things we are not aware of about the man .also the fictional element on the story was also nicely blended with the reality
Over all this movie is worth a theater watch .for those whoblikes to watch a solid crime drama this is a good choice.",Kurup

2063,20,swathibal,This one will stick with you for a while!,7/10,23 November 2021,"For those of you are not familiar, the movie is loosely based on the life of a fugitive from Kerala, Sukumara Kurup.To be honest, although I have heard of him several times (mostly through Malayalam movie references), I really had no idea who he was or why he became so notorious.Enter the movie Kurup, threw some light on my ignorance and then more. The real circumstances surrounding Sukumara Kurup and his crimes in itself is so mysterious and curious that any form of portrayal of this story will spike your interest.Now, coming exclusively the movie, one cannot call it an ultra realistic plot, there is a lot of cinematic liberty used in it. However, in the context that it's presented, it was quite engaging.Acting wise, Shine Tom did a brilliant job, DQ, Indrajit and Shobita played their parts convincingly. Screenplay wise, the second half was much more fast paced and interesting than the first half. The first half could have benefited from some editing and cuts. Songs were kind of forced and unnecessary.Overall, it is an interesting watch, and more than the movie itself, the premise, which is the mystery of Sukumara Kurup will haunt you for while after you leave the theatres (or switch off your TV).",Kurup

The shoddy writing didn't help. It's seems like the story was written by different people at different points in the storyline.The actress looks lost, first 20mins of the story is from the perspective of a friend which is lost since there is no call back to these characters in IAF later in the story.Only DQ fans would have loved this movie only for his slo-mo shots. Apart from that, nobody can make sense of this ridiculous film.",Kurup

2066,23,madhupill2002,Kurup is stretched,8/10,13 November 2021,"Kurup is classy. Kurup is tremendously cinematic rather a true story. Kurup is worth the wait. Kurup is fine with me though I avoid regional movies. Not a documentary style of story telling as some of the fans anticipated. The first half would have been reduced by 25 mins. Second portion is fast paced, well directed and acted by all nicely.Only one glitch. If you ask me how to pronounce Cheriyanad it will be 'Chernaad' and majority of the locals and family call it ""Chernaad"" and not Cheriyanad as the writer/director stuck with correct written pronunciation which is not natural. Some sequences in Air Force part is exaggerated and ill conceived.Also the head of the investigative officers did a tremendous job of trying to nab the real culprit. Then in 1984 till 2005 was a well known figure of the family which the director or the research team is missing or they refused to show it in the film.There is a scope for a sequel and I call it Alaxander!So many characters missing. Neither detail about Suresh Kurup who is brother of GK nor the whereabouts of GK's family (wife& kids) after the incident is missing!!DQ did a tremendous job as a producer and main actor so is Shine who was depicted more of a villain than GK of real story.Also the murder, investigation and subsequent media frenzy on the family took place when we were just 16. That's almost 38 years ago.Go and watch it if you missed theatre for two long years👍🏻🙏🏻",Kurup

2070,27,ramchandani-44889,Could have been a landmark cinema but Slow script Poor effort and execution lets it down,2/10,21 November 2021,"This is not your typical masala entertainer it kind of keeps slowing down now and then and no proper dialogues to keep you hooked onto like in Mammooka films, styling is ok but performance always matters.

2072,29,denzildas,Excellent work Dulquer Salman,10/10,14 November 2021,"Nothing to say as negative in movies, dont know why these are barking as movie is waste, most of them are a molly-wood superstar's toxic fans and i know it. I am not a die hard fan of Dulquer Salman but the movie's 1st half is basically a bit lag, cause its a real life incident on a criminal named Sukumara Kurup, one of the most wanted criminal in India. If the story was made quite entertaining its thrill of watching will disappear for sure. The movie's climax, especially the last 40 minutes was lit
. Degrading the movie is now the hobby of the above mentioned superstar's toxic fans. Dont listen to them. The movie is must watch. As a kerala citizen, we know the story of Sukumara Kurup but, even after knowing the story also, the movie was a thrilling one, cause the appearance of Dulquer and the camera work was lit. And finally concluding by saying its a must watch movie and We are with Chacko's family.

2073,30,itzmeat,"Poor execution of a real life incident, and weak screenplay",2/10,13 November 2021,"Kurup is one time watchable thriller movie, nothing special expect the bgm and cinematography, story line is very weak and the movie mainly focuses on marketing dulquer's style more than the real incident, sometimes it's feel like the director twisted the story in the way to show dulquer's charm and styleThe role played by indrajith and shine Tom is sublime. Not a very challenging role for dulquer salman, and he didn't perform anything new than his usual mannersims,The story showed in the movie is not acceptable to the audience , who actually knows about Sukumar kurup's story and the climax was not logically acceptable to normal citizens,
Most of the time the moving is going too slow and execution of the story was not good. Weak screenplay, and too lagging.Although the movie must be a treat to the persons who doesn't know much about history and die heart dulquer fans and persons who admire and going only to watch his style.It's actually a below average poor execution of a real life incident , only targeting initial profit buy selling style.Sometime I wonder why people are cheering while showing the name of a criminal in police record book, like showing the name of Mahatma Gandhi on screen.",Kurup

2075,32,sharkris,Overhyped (by blind fans),3/10,13 November 2021,"The film is an average one at best. Focused so much on star power marketing rather than good entertaining cinema. Laggy first half. The murder is glorified, despite the fact that the promoters said it's not. Although some of the performances are good as you would expect, the ending left more wanting.The rating here is skewed by at least 4 points (by fan brain / bots). So that's gone into this lower rating of mine to balance it out. I would otherwise give it 6. It's high time more people started rated fairly, after actually watching the movie. There is a trend now of bumping up IMDB numbers right around film's release, jobless busy body fake raters like these are perhaps the new gen employees of Malayalam cinema. It may be good for money making but really not great for the future of good cinema in Kerala.

2076,33,nikhilcbabu7,OK Movie,7/10,13 November 2021,"Script - 7/10
Direction - 8/10
Acting - 8/10
Cinematography - 9/10
Bgm -10/10A good entertainer that is a one time watch. Its nothing close to a ""masterpiece"" or a ""cult classic"" as the advertisers and the teen kids want you to believe. And its nothing close to a third rate movie as some degraders want you to believe.As far as the story is concerned its a mix of realilty and fiction. Anyway the overall outline of the story is around 70% real. Do we get to the real Kurup? To some extent, yes we do.The romantic song is really good. It gets better with each time you listen. The background music is ""cult"" level. In fact the BGM did a great role in hiding the imperfections in Script and Direction.The lead lady did a fine job along with Shine Tom Chacko and Indrajith. Dulquer act was the usual, nothing out of box. He still has to go beyond his comfort zone. That doesnt mean he hasnt got his charms. Boy, the guy is extra charming. All I say is he has miles to go ahead in terms of acting.The pre release over-advertisement of the movie will create many expectations for the audience. So it wouldn't be a surprise if this movie would get mixed reviews.Overall verdict - A good entertainer for 170rs.",Kurup
2077,34,vdeepak-54339,Not really a crisp one,6/10,24 November 2021,"First of all DQ shines all the way through the entire movie. When the trailer was shown about one of the biggest fugitive cases of India, this turned out to be a slow and burn very late kind of movie. The background score is to be applauded and the fashion design for DQ was apt for all the eras. But as a plot the first half never gets established , you don't feel the grip. Intermission is blunt , all the action happens at the end of the movie . But by that time you would have already guessed lot of plot points. This could have been 120 minutes instead of the extra 36 minutes.

Not saying film is the best in this genre or best movie in this year but it would definitely be both time and money worthy experience . Kurup (2021) exhibits a brilliant direction from Srinath Rajendran more excellent work by Sushin Shyam excellent cinematography and outstanding production design , costume and making . Film focuses around Dulquer Salmaan's character if you still hate Dulquer Salmaan you will be amazed by seeing performance by co-actors especially from Shine Tom Chacko.

Acting was also a positive thing about this film. The first half of the film make you feel lag as it is a slowy one. The second half is much better than the first half. If you know the real story of kurup you will miss that wow factor. There are several star cast which have no several impact or nothing to prove section in the movie only dulquer, indrajith, shine tom chacko got the portion to prove their acting side...the characters of sunny wayne, bharath, tovino should be given to some new faces as they have nothing to perform un this film.. Overall music and bgms of the film was great but there are some portion where bgm can be avoided because it cannot merge with the situation...Coming to the story part its that much thrilling as it is based on true events and most of the people knows the real story. Coming to screenplay there is something is missing like the character of sunny wayne..the character not further shown after sometime.. (Personal opinion)... Overall its a one time watchable movie. 🌟",Kurup

2090,47,Rinaldopazzi,SENSATIONAL MOVIE!!!,10/10,13 November 2021,"Can't quite understand why people saying the movie didn't have enough mass elements. Seriously, a biopic of a criminal and you want punch dialogues and mass?? This is a really good movie taken in a non linear way and unless you see it to the end, you won't completely understand it. Everything is interlinked. I understand the fans of a particular actor are trying to degrade this, but no dice. Every major reviewing sites have given this a positive review, cause it deserves that. First half is a bit dragged and only becomes engaging once Shine Tom Chacko comes in. But the second half, man it is truly electrifying. Many scenes of the first half makes complete sense in second half. A must watch if you're a fan of crime thriller genre. Enjoy.

2099,56,thommuullas,The movie is an average one time watchable entertainer,7/10,14 November 2021,"The movie didn't create a space as it was expected in the trailer. The bgm was stunning. Some of the scenes were just included in the movie for no reason. It is a one time watchable one. Dulqur could have improved and the actress was to be changed.

DQ shines as the lead & holds the film together. The highlight is direction, director who with oscillating storyline, keeps you hooked. Production design, cinematography ,music & Casting are a plus. Kurup is an interesting watch.",Kurup
2102,59,ihsanpkl,Awesome!!!,9/10,13 November 2021,"I first we may not be that attracted to the movie but the second half and the climax 🔥. It was just awesome. They promoted the movie at a very large scale. And the movie has it.(I dont think this is a spoiler, because the creators of the film already said this)But I feel, Kurup wasn't characterized as a villain that much. I mean, yeah they show him as a villain, but that guy deserved even more,I think.

First half of the movie is filled with good dramatic moments and thrilling towards interval scene, which felt interesting, Second half of the movie gone to complete thriller.Performance wise telling that DULQER SALMAN's career best performance you can see, apart from that Shine tom chacko did an amazing work great acting.

Honestly this whole movie seems to be more of hype or pump video promoting DQ. Nothing against him but the rich get richer and nepotism continous. If this movie was done by Joju, I think he would have aced the OG portrayal of Kurup.

But first half lags big time until the pre-interval ,The neo noir sceenplay didn't help much but rather its confusing to many. Second half is racy , finishes in no time with more commercial appeal to it. Its a good watch on the whole but if the makers have more concentrated in screenplay of first half with little more detailing with case rather than his love interest it would have been a great watch.

Very weak character when it comes to police officer Indrajith probably to over highlight the here Dulquer. The filmmakers' obsession with the form of the narration has blinded them to the fact that they are not telling the story as engrossingly as possible. It is criminal that the filmmakers have tucked away a compelling idea about a larger-than-life wicked phantom in the footnote of the movie. It is baffling that the filmmakers failed to recognise and explore such a goldmine of material, instead of half-heartedly re-telling the information about Kurup and his crime that is readily available to the public.

Keeping that judgement aside, Sushin Shyam has done top notch work in the sound space. The songs are also good.Cinematically, the movie scores on multiple fronts. Color grading is excellent. Period set designs have been nicely done. Costumes have been good. Cinematography has been excellent. At the start of the movie, there were a few jerky edits but did not feel any further issues after the titles rolled in. Title work has also been good.Dulqar's screen presence has been great while the performances of pretty much all the actors have been flawless. Shine Tom Chacko's performance stands out for the convincing portrayal of a deranged.There are a few points where the director's earlier movie ""Second Show"" plays in.Writing has been pretty good. The structure has been carefully built out and makes for an entertaining watch from a story line perspective. A slow burner, the story draws you in nicely and takes you to nice twists. The script does not blow your mind - but nicely done. To some extent, a predictable line.Making scores over the script.The movie is a stylish anti-hero slow burner best enjoyed in a theatre.",Kurup
2128,0,MartinHafer,It's almost extremely clever...,6/10,20 May 2016,"""Cabin in the Woods"" was a very frustrating film for me to watch. While the movie did a great job in explaining WHY we keep seeing all those dumb clichés in hack 'em up movies (such as the bimbo who dies first and the dumb jock), it ultimately allowed itself to, in the end, be just about as dumb and mindless as a typical hack and slash film. It's a real shame, as for so much of the movie it kept my attention.The film is a twist on the usual young adults being murdered in the woods film because you soon see that all this is being orchestrated by a group of people working in a weird base underground. Exactly why and who they are isn't known until later...all you know is that these folks watch EVERYTHING that's happening to a group of victims and they even bet as to what is going to happen next. It's all very clever and the actual explanation is a mixed bag. On the one hand it does explain things pretty well but on the other, it just degenerates into a giant bloodbath that seems to value blood and chaos more than sticking with the underlying plot.The bottom line is that the film is a near miss...a film that almost works superbly. Instead, the ending just lost me amid the chaos. For my time and money, I much preferred ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil""...much more complete and enjoyable anti-hacker sort of film. This was a disappointment...as was seeing the gorgeous Chris Hemsworth...but without his usual blonde head of hair!",The Cabin in the Woods
2129,1,Leofwine_draca,"Not as good as it thinks it is, but great last half hour",6/10,15 June 2014,"For the first hour of its running time, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is a fairly awful movie. It comes across as a semi-spoof of THE EVIL DEAD and all of its ilk with one of those oh-so-witty post-modern twists, in which the whole set-up is being televised and broadcast a la THE TRUMAN SHOW. For this first hour, the film is saddled with an obnoxious script and the kind of characters you'd find in a cheesy B-movie. I'm not quite sure what Joss Whedon was thinking.Then, at around the hour mark, there's a huge, huge twist and the film becomes something else entirely. It becomes a higher-budgeted spin on the likes of CUBE, and then of course there's a sudden onslaught of monsters which will delight any fans of the horror genre. Sadly, copyright means that some of the monsters only resemble cinematic creations of old, like the Lord of Bondage and Pain guy who looks like Pinhead from HELLRAISER but isn't. Imagine if they'd had the rights to show all the great movie creatures - now that would have been great!So, for the finale, this film becomes a post-modern spoof with references to anything and everything, not least my old favourite, H. P. Lovecraft. The thing it most brings to mind, for me, are the two WAXWORKS movies with their celebration of the depth and breadth of horror movie monsters. The CGI effects are passable, and the script is never as good as it thinks it is, but it is quite a bit of fun at the end. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS as a whole doesn't hang together and both acting and direction are bland, but it's a film that's been purpose built to appeal to movie fans so it's worth at least a single watch.",The Cabin in the Woods

2131,3,Horst_In_Translation,"Pointless entertainment, okay to watch once",6/10,5 August 2017,"""The Cabin in the Woods"" is an American English language movie from 2012, so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. The co-writer here is Joss Whedon, perhaps the most famous name attached to the project. Writer and director is Drew Goddard, an Oscar nominee for his ""The Martian"" script now. Oh wait, ""Thor"" Chris Hemsworth is in these 95 minutes too, so he is probably the biggest name. This is what happens when 5 young adults go on a trip to the location mentioned in the title. Not much later, the first zombies show up. But what sets this movie apart from every generic zombie horror film is that a major plot in here is a bit of a horror equivalent of ""The Truman Show"". Certainly not a coincidence that the only guy who sees the entire thing critical is also called Truman. Or newer generations not familiar with the Jim Carrey film can also compare it a bit to The Hunger Games. Anyway, this surveillance plot stars Jenkins and Acker and Whitford and I like all three of them which made this part of the story location-wise almost as interesting as the core story. That part is also where you will find most of the comedy and this comedic stuff is where the film works best.Or I could say perhaps too ""the only part where it works"" as the more serious dramatic parts just never felt convincing, especially the nerdy stoner guy surviving really everything and turning into some bad-ass superhero almost. Was this done for the nerds, for them to like this movie to have the nerd survive next to the hot chick until the very end? Perhaps. If so, it was a success. As for him, he also only delivered in terms of comedy. As for the horror moments, the film is pretty generic for the most part and the revelation of these monster chambers is also more quantity than quality. Plus the way they make fun of themselves towards the end with the horny promiscuous chick dying first, moments after exposing her breasts of course, cannot save it overall. Same for the virgin references about Connolly's character. It is also a fairly manipulative movie that wants us to put friendship over the existence of humanity. But it never poses a question of moral. It makes very clear what it wants the audience to think on several occasions and there it only works for the easily influenced and entertained. Successfully as I saw from other reactions in the audience. It is what it is, eventually an apocalyptic horror comedy that for me only worked from the comedy perspective. Some fairly witty ideas in here, but story-wise the execution could have been a lot better. I recommend it nonetheless I think, even if the recognition by IMDb voters, awards bodies and critics is definitely on the exaggerated side. See it if you like the genre(s).",The Cabin in the Woods

(b) Then there is the ""Evil Dead"" rip-off, with five friends in a cabin reading a book and unleashing ""The Walking Dead"". (c) Then there is ""The Truman Show"" environment, with their deaths monitored by a team on televisions. (d) Last, there are moments of ""Cube"" and ""Resident Evil"", when Dana and Marty learn what is happening.The lame conclusion with ancient gods in the underground is ridiculous and without a reasonable explanation.

Even within a genre there's always going to be people hating or loving something that the majority thinks is obviously the complete opposite. This isn't ""true"" horror, it does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of wit. There are quite a few nods and there are many little things ""hidden"" in the subtext or out in the open for people to discover. Even simple things as the ""running upstairs"" cliché gets a spin (or at least I think it does. But with Joss Wheddon on script duties, I'm pretty sure this was no mere accident).Talking about clichés, you do get a few, but those clichés are there and they are always getting a spin that works. It doesn't look like Joss tries to make it work. He just makes it work. And while I did stress out the comedy factor, this still pulls some scares and does get dirty and bloody. Not for the faint hearted then.This warrants repeat viewings, just to catch even more hints, jokes and just pure Wheddon magic (for me at least).

Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.The trouble with writing a review for this film is that I risk giving too much away, so I will just not say anything at all. The creators -- Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon -- have taken the horror genre and turned it on its head. The themes that have been done to death are satirized here while maintaining a scary atmosphere.What a shame that this film got caught up in MGM's financial problems and took almost three years to get released. Chris Hemsworth needs more exposure, and Richard Jenkins never disappoints.

2135,7,jboothmillard,The Cabin in the Woods,7/10,23 October 2012,"When I heard the title I assumed it was a remake of some classic scary movie, but I investigated and found it was an original story, and I was also glad to see that the critics gave it a pretty good rating, four out of five stars, so I was hoping it would be a suitable amount of stars when I watched it. Basically five teenagers and college students, Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison) and her boyfriend Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth), Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams) and Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz) are heading for a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. They are completely unaware that technicians are watching their every move and listening to their every word, because they are controlling what happens to them as they stay in the cabin, and they are not the only ones in the world, these technicians are creating bizarre scenarios in other countries such as Japan and Germany. The technicians are pumping in mind enhancing and influencing drugs so they will do things like be aware of things and have sex with each other, and they set up a diary in the basement so that one of them will read the pages and summon the Buckner family, all are dead and have become killer zombies. The events the teenagers are getting up are obviously being filmed, it is for the benefit of who the technicians are working for, like a reality show, so they are pleased to see Jules and Curt go outside to have sex, the sight of her breasts, and then them be attacked by the zombies, they kill Jules while Curt runs back to warn the others. Marty who is highly influenced by marijuana had paranoid suspicions before the strange things started happening, even finding hidden cameras in the walls, and he is sure that something is manipulating them, and then the zombies take him away. Dana, Holden and Curt get in the RV and plan to get away driving, heading through the tunnel that goes through the near hills, but the technicians set an explosion that collapses the rock into the tunnel, and then Curt thinks to use his motorbike to jump across to the other side of the raven, but an invisible security force field causes him to crash and fall to his death. Dana is sure now that Marty's suspicions were correct, and Holden is killed while driving in the RV back to the cabin, and crashing into the lake Dana gets away, the technicians are happy that they have completed their job and she is the last alive to be affected by fate, but in fact Marty is still alive. He finds her and shows her his discovery under the cabin of a secret trap door that goes down to an underground elevator, Marty has been immune to the technicians' attempts to influence him because of his high marijuana intoxication, and in the elevator the two remaining survivors pass numerous trapped monsters, all made to kill. Dana realises that the zombies up above were sent because of release activation, it was one of the objects in the cabin that determined they would be attacked by zombies, and when she and Marty reach the ground floor they explore the facility the monsters came from. The two of them get close to being caught by the security, but a large button is activated by Dana that releases all of the trapped monsters from their chambers, these include a psycho killer, a giant snake, a ghost, a merman and many others, and they start attacking the workers of the facility, including Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) and Wendy Lin (Amy Acker) who had been watching the cabin. After Dana unintentionally stabs technician Gary Sitterson (Let Me In's Richard Jenkins), she and Marty find a temple with large stone tablets with figure carvings that fill with blood when each intended victim has died, and they meet the Director (Sigourney Weaver) who explains that the technicians have been killing people across the world in sacrifice to appease the Ancient Ones who slumber below. She says that the certain archetypes are the ones who must die in a certain order, Jules was the whore and died first, Curt was the athlete and died second, Holden was the scholar and died third, Marty was meant to die fourth as the fool, and Dana as the virgin would have her fate decided by natural cause. The Director says that if this ritual is not carried out and there is no sacrifice made then these godlike creatures below will awake and the world will end because of the vast destruction by them, and she says that the rituals elsewhere have failed as well, so she gives the Dana choice to kill Marty and save the world, or face doom. In the end interruptions cause Dana to not give the theory of saving the world, the Director is killed by one of the zombies, Marty forgives Dana for threatening to shoot him, but they accept the fate the world will face, and see an amusing side that the earth needs a new race, and soon enough a giant hand crashes through the earth and crushes the cabin. The cast of young stars are fine, particularly Connolly and Kranz, and Hemsworth in his short time, and the actors playing the people watching are terrific being sadistic and enjoying their torture, the simple zombie attacking premise was good, villains watching them made it more interesting, but it got really good when you realise that the zombies are only one of the possibilities for how the victims could have been killed, the rooms of monsters was clever, and I wasn't expecting to see Weaver in it, overall it is a most worthwhile horror thriller. Very good!",The Cabin in the Woods
2136,8,Tweekums,A solid horror from Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard,8/10,6 December 2016,"Like so many horror films this features a group of good-looking young people going to a remote location together where bad things will inevitably happen; in this case the titular cabin in the woods. There is something different about the location though; they think they are all alone but the viewer knows that they have been selected, prepared and their every move is being watched and manipulated by a team of people whose motives are initially unknown. Once at the cabin they settle in and as they sit around the door to a cellar blows open. They explore and find a variety of strange artefacts. These include a dairy that one of the girls starts to read; it was written over a hundred years ago by a girl who was abused by her sadistic family. As she reads a section in Latin the ground outside opens up and this family rises from their graves with the intention of killing the unwitting young people. Things soon get nasty as they are picked off one by one as they try to get away.This film deconstructs the horror genre as 'Scream' did many years before; it was done in an entirely different way though. If it was just red-neck zombie killers killing college students in the woods it would have been less interesting but knowing that somebody is behind it all made it more interesting as we don't initially know why they are doing it which adds a degree of mystery. There are some good twists along the way as well as plenty of scares although nothing too scary. While it is only rated '15', in the UK, it is pretty gory at times the ending is incredibly bloody! I liked how the film played with clichés of the genre; notably the order in which people die and the fact that one of them might be allowed to survive. There are plenty of nods to other films but it doesn't really matter if you haven't seen those films. The cast does a fine job making us believe in their characters as they deal with their unlikely but deadly situation. Overall an enjoyable horror film with scares and humour that has plenty of interesting twists.",The Cabin in the Woods

Well, that's precisely what Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard want you to think, except that there is absolutely nothing 'typical' about this film.The initial set up will be familiar to most, but with the early introduction of a group of sinister scientists keeping tabs on events at the cabin (via some sophisticated surveillance equipment), it soon becomes apparent that things aren't as they might at first seem. As the film unfolds, Whedon and Goddard seize every opportunity to play with the conventions of the genre and mess with their viewers' expectations; the result is a whole lot of demented fun, something that I can only describe as 'The Evil Dead meets Lost'.To give away anything further about the plot would be to ruin your enjoyment, so I'll keep schtum and leave you to discover the secrets of The Cabin In The Woods by yourself. Suffice to say that the film delivers all of the standard horror movie clichés (a dark cellar full of bizarre objects, sex in the woods, a creepy gas station attendant, etc.,) but what it does with them takes the film into refreshingly new horror territory where the standard rules of the genre simply do not apply.",The Cabin in the Woods
2138,10,paul_haakonsen,It went from interesting to ridiculous...,4/10,18 August 2012,"Are you kidding? This was one of the worst horror movies I have had to sit through.The story is about five people heading out to a remote cabin in the mountains, isolated from the outside world. During the stay in the rundown cabin, a cellar door opens up on its own, and the people go into the cellar to discover what is going on. Here they find a book from which one of them reads aloud some ancient Latin words. With these words read aloud, zombies are unleashed, as is something else entirely...What? Wait, let's back it up here. Can anyone say ""Evil Dead""? This was either tribute to the cult classic or a shameless and utter rip off. It was everything repeated from ""Evil Dead"", but just added with some extra stuff.This movie's plot line and story was such a lame copy that it was an embarrassment to witness and a pain to behold. There wasn't a single scary moment in the entire movie. And when you finally are let in on what is going on, you just sit there is disbelief and shake your head at the ludicrous ridiculousness of it all.The characters in the movie were so stereotypical that it was bordering on being generic characters just copy+pasted into the movie. As in any slasher movie, you have a jock, a nerd, a virgin, party-lover, and a girl with no morals. Could it be any more stereotypical?But it wasn't all bad, there were some good parts to the movie as well. There was some really great creature effects in the last third of the movie. Plus there was zombies - anything with zombies is a notch upward in my book. And the scene when Sigourney Weaver entered, that was just the high point of the movie, the most climatic scene in the entire movie. And finally, as the movie ended, Nine Inch Nails was being played. Oh, and not to forget that in the last 20 minutes or so, there is a great amount of gore and mayhem, which almost, just almost, makes it worth suffering through the entire movie just to watch. That was actually some of the best parts of the movie all together, at least it was what caught my interest.This movie was nothing at all as to what I had expected it to be. And it was actually a rather boring and dull experience to sit through. A very anti-climatic movie, and once you are let in on what is going on there, the movie just goes from being boring to being downright ridiculous. I have nothing but respect and awe for the Great Old Gods, but this was just insulting.If anything then the creature effects would make it worth watching the movie, or the less than 5 minutes that Sigourney Weaver is in it. Or for the fact that you have references to almost every slasher movie throughout the last 30 years stuffed into this movie. The rest of the movie is just a waste of time and effort. I am giving this movie a 4/10 rating; 1 point for Sigourney Weaver, 1 point for the creatures, 1 point for the bloodshed and gore in the last 20 minutes, and finally 1 point as the base minimum score that must be given. Had it not been for those, I would have opted for a 1/10 rating.",The Cabin in the Woods
2139,11,Coventry,"Another clichéd, conventional backwoods horror . Or perhaps not?",7/10,23 May 2012,"The title, the setting, the casting of the young protagonists, the one-paragraph synopsis  All these aspects and more lead to suspect that ""Cabin in the Woods"" is just another derivative backwoods horror flick like there are thirteen in a dozen. Five of the most stereotypical college students head out to a rotten cabin the deep forests for a weekend of booze, soft drugs and premarital sex. During the first evening already, they stumble upon a cellar full of mysterious old relics and – not so surprisingly – unleash a type of evil that relentlessly pursues and eliminates them one by one. Yes, admittedly, this does sound exactly like the plot of ""Evil Dead"", so might this just be another passable and uninspired imitation of Sam Raimi's classic and a truckload of others? Oh hell no, because this is where the genius of writers/director Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard enters the scene. One brief look at the repertoires of both these men is enough to assume that they won't simply deliver such an inferior and unoriginal cinematic product. The aforementioned description may sound prototypic, but the opening sequence immediately state clear that the overall film certainly is not. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" opens with two aging men in suits – wondrously depicted by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford – babbling about random irrelevant private stuff when all of a sudden and totally unexpectedly the title torpedoes onto the screen in giant red letters! Intro's like these make my mouth water, as you know you're about to witness something very unique and unconventional. The further interactions between these men, and apparently a fully structured prominent organization behind them, run parallel with the unsuspecting students' trip. They observe and manipulate their every move and even place wagers on how the quintet will respond to a next ordeal. Meanwhile, the script also exaggeratedly puts the emphasis on how clichéd the set up, in fact, is. Each character perfectly fits into a specific category of archetypes (the jock, the nice girl, the bimbo, the stoner and the black model student), they point out themselves that they're heading to an area geographically cut off from civilization and they encounter the obligatory foretelling freak at the last gas station. The bigger picture behind all this remains mysterious and only unfolds in very small bits. Of course I will not reveal the denouement here, but you can rest assured it's something entirely innovative and unpredictable (and this comment comes from someone who has seen more than 3.000 horror movies). To evoke even more curiosity, I will still add that whenever you *think* to have figured out what's going on, Whedon and Goddard slap you around the head with another ingenious gimmick, sub plot or piece of dialog. Even though the duo accomplished most of their previous successes in the fantasy & Sci-Fi genres (""The Avengers"", ""Lost"", ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer""), they demonstrate great knowledge on horror classics as well. The similarities with ""The Evil Dead"" are evident, but there are numerous other slick and witty references to genre milestones such as ""Hellraiser"", ""Re-Animator"" and ""Ringu"".

It's really not as clever as its filmmakers would seem to think, but it does offer a fresh spin on standard horror formulas for people desperate for something different.To reveal too much would be a mistake; it's best that people go in not knowing a lot. What this review will state is that on the surface this would appear to be an ""Evil Dead"" type of film about five young people journeying to the title location and having to deal with sadistic zombies. But things aren't as they appear. Other eyes are watching as the scenario plays out.The horror doesn't work as well as one might like due to the nature of the script, written by producer Joss Whedon (creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and director Drew Goddard. Still, some genre fans may be pleased to note the level of brutality on display. There ends up being a ton of special effects and spectacle. The ultimate revelation of why this is all necessary is really rather lame, but the audience may still enjoy being taken for the ride and appreciate the way that the story resolves itself.The acting from all concerned is solid, with old pro Richard Jenkins a standout. The five main roles are clichés - including a jock, a stoner, and a virgin - but as we will see the selection of such archetypes is quite deliberate. Fans will enjoy seeing the cameo appearance by a beloved genre superstar.Some genre fans may feel that this film is condescending to them and dislike what seems to be hubris on the part of the filmmakers in terms of their cleverness. Others will like seeing what amounts to an interesting deconstruction of genre staples.

And (for once) we have good actors playing these clichés and good dialogue (with some humor that is actually pretty funny). But the fun quickly drains away. After you find out what is going on it stops being fun and just gets pretty sick and disturbing. The movie seems to think it's much cleverer than it actually is. This does NOT rewrite the horror genre like ""Scream"" did in 1996 (although a lot of critics think it does). Also, for a film that seems to praise itself for being so clever, they throw in a REALLY pointless gratuitous topless nude scene which was NOT needed. It redeems itself somewhat towards the last section which gets REALLY REALLY gory and has a cameo by a respected actress (my audience laughed and applauded when she appeared) but it doesn't save the movie entirely. It's not a total loss--it's just not as clever as critics seem to think. ALL the acting is good and you care about the characters--but that's about it.

It is done with such heaviness that the ""Black Comedy"" is drowned in a deluge of half-realized parodies and screen references obliterated by gallons of blood.It's all here in a bloated belief that the makeup, CGI, and a parade of ""monster icons"" could have fans salivating with glee as they impress each other with a checklist of terror trivia.

It understands the genre that it's being part of and uses all of its clichés and yet manage to turn it into something fun, without ever becoming a true spoof of the genre.It really uses all of the familiar genre ingredients, of a couple of friends going to a cabin in the woods (hence the movie its title!), in the middle of nowhere. You of course already know what will be happening all to them...or do you? The story manages to give some spins to its movie, that are unusual, surprising and original but above all things are also things to add to the movie its fun.It obviously got put together by a bunch of people who had a true love for the genre and also really understood it. They understood what it is that makes a great genre movie and also what annoys the lovers of the genre, which is something this movie makes perfectly and subtly fun of at times. Because yes, make no mistake about it, this movie is a horror but at the same time also really a comedy! It makes this movie perfect to watch for all sorts of people. It's a great and fun movie for the horror lover and the more casual movie goer will also surely enjoy the ride because of its comedy elements.Because the movie, despite all of its clichés, manages to become such an original one, it is already being considered to be one of the best genre movies of recent years.

Bad Stuff starts happening, and over the course of this, with its countless(seriously, I can barely believe that all that happened in roughly 90 minutes... this is astonishingly well-paced, it never slows down and yet it doesn't overwhelm) beat changes, plot twists and unexpected situations, right up to the excellent ending, this satirizes(with plenty of meta) modern horror, as in, from the 70's and to today(and thus, it fits in a lot of strong language, bloody, gory, disturbing violence, a little eye-candy, sexuality and topless female nudity), a genre that it's unmistakably clear that Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon despise. Don't get me wrong, it's an awful lot of fun throughout, but you may want to keep that in mind. A portion of the audience I saw this with didn't seem to get into this... perhaps they were expecting an entry into the genre? I don't see how, from the trailer... and yes, that shot of a bird flying out of the Animus simulation and desynchronizing makes sense, and no, you shouldn't know anything about what's really going on in this other than what the previews hint. Anyway, unlike the Scream series, this doesn't go for terrifying its viewers half of the time, or any of it(there are some decent jump-scares, and it can certainly be creepy). It is mainly pointing out the stupid conventions of the medium, and there are those that will find it overly cynical in such. The acting is great by all involved. Characters are well-developed and relatively fleshed out. The FX are fantastic, as is the referencing and creative use of... let's just say, this is a remarkably stimulating experience. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it and of this kind of thing. 8/10",The Cabin in the Woods

Or the....",8/10,2 October 2012,"A pretty insanely entertaining horror comedy that is far more interested in deconstructing the genre than it is in providing its audience with any legitimate scares.Five obligatory college kids go off to a cabin that looks an awful lot like the one from ""The Evil Dead,"" only to accidentally awaken from slumber a family of deranged hillbilly zombies. We then are treated to all of the typical conversations and actions that college kids in these kinds of movies would seem perpetually forced to go through and that we've seen a hundred times before, until the movie reveals that these kids ARE being forced through their paces and that we've seen this a hundred times before because someone WANTS us to see it a hundred times.The big reveal in this movie isn't that much of a reveal. The film is way too well written to overly rely on a gimmick. It sets the stage in its first scene, and develops its conceit through funny writing and clever plotting, not through major twists and ""gotcha!"" moments.In our age of instant gratification, it's probably pointless to try to keep movie secrets secret. Discussions with spoilers are started on message boards before the audience has even left the theatre. But if you're interested in ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" try to go into it knowing as little about it as possible. Knowing the general premise won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie, but it's still a film best experienced fresh.Grade: A",The Cabin in the Woods

After an encounter with a sinister man at a filling station, they eventually arrive at the run down cabin, and start behaving in the ways in which young people in remote cabins are accustomed to behave. But what are those men in white coats up to? Drew Goddard's first movie as director (co-written with Joss Whedon) tells us, before we sit down to watch it, that it is playing with a sub-genre of the horror movie, and that it wants us to know this right from the start. And what follows is as playful as the title. We get our fair share of cabin in the woods shenanigans, but we get a heck of a lot else, too. And I'm not going to say anything about them, because this movie has surprises up its sleeve.It also has a very good script, with some laugh out loud moments. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.",The Cabin in the Woods
2150,22,ferguson-6,What our dreams are from,6/10,21 April 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Well I was not ready for the horror genre to be turned on its ear, but that's exactly what co-writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (also director) have done here. Rest assured that your favorite aspects of horror films will be lampooned, or at least parodied. There are times you will jump and laugh simultaneously, but mostly I found myself checking off the influences/targets of the filmmakers.There is no way to comment on this film without offering up spoilers, and I will not do that. What I can tell you is that you'll be reminded of films such as Scream, Friday the 13th, Bubba Ho-Tep, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Saw, and dare I say, elements of The Twilight Zone ... you know the parts where you know there is more going on than you are seeing, but you can't quite put it all together.The movie starts out with a tongue-in-cheek assembly of generic characters from most horror films: the fun-loving jock (Chris Hemsworth, pre-Thor), the ""bad"" girl (Anna Hutchison), the ""good"" girl (Kristen Connolly), the brainiac (Jesse Williams), and of course the comic relief stoner waxing philosophical (a very effective Fran Kranz). This group piles into a borrowed RV and heads to the cabin. And yes, we get the obligatory stop at the run down gas station manned by the straight-from-Deliverance attendant played by Tim De Zarn.We learn quickly that something odd is going on and our heroes are really playthings in some kind of cosmic game being conducted at an underground lab run by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. That much is shown in the trailer and that's the end of what I can say. After that, the choice is yours ... just like in the basement.I have no idea who to recommend this to because the last 15 minutes are pure mayhem, and you will either be fully onboard with this Disneyland ride gone bad, or you will have wanted to leave for the past hour. The movie was selected for opening night at SXSW and it truly is a twisted, even demented jab at all things horror. Only you can decide what comes next.",The Cabin in the Woods

Ideas Up Front.,4/10,21 May 2015,"The Cabin in the Woods (2012): Dir: Drew Goddard / Cast: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams: While the previews spew off promises of ominous thrills of forbidden evils, the screenplay quickly unravels to reveal a total mess complete with every moron stereotype that the screenwriter could muster up. The premise seems familiar yet it works up to an extent. Five college students travel to an isolated cabin not realizing that the place is bugged and they're being watched. The viewers are scientist types cheering, betting, giving high fives, and all around manipulating what occurs to these victims. The first mistake is a venture down a dark cellar where objects are handled and the Latin spell of a book is read. This unleashes zombies that originally occupied the cabin. These victims are chosen specifically for a certain element. Chris Hemsworth is the athlete, Anna Hutchison is the sexually active, Jesse Williams is the intellect, Fran Kranz is the dope smoking fool, and Kristen Connolly is tagged as the virgin. None of them emerge with personalities but director Drew Goddard makes great references to films such as The Evil Dead. The third act is bizarre and leaves a severe sense of dread. Why these films insists on a future of hellish fatality gives one the belief that its makers have no faith in the reality of good. The special effects are inventive, graphic and pretty much steal the film. If you have the desire to watch people suffer for the entertainment of others, then this film is for you. For a superior choice, I recommend The Hunger Games. Score: 4 / 10",The Cabin in the Woods
2152,24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Weaker than it should be but still solid enough,9/10,8 December 2014,"Heading out to a cabin in the woods, a group of friends finds that their actions have stirred a dark, evil presence nearby and must try to fight for their lives only to learn of a far greater threat within.This was quite a fun and enjoyable entry that has a lot of really fun things about it. One of the better elements to this one is the fact that there's just enough comedy here to play this off as a parody yet still be taken completely seriously. Because this one is so heavily built around clichés and utilizes them to their fullest extent here really drives this one not only by partaking in the clichés but then offering a rather unique take on that need for the clichéd nature of these prototypical stories. This in turn drives up the rather ingenious storyline here where it builds on these types and then sets them into action against numerous enemies as this one kicks in with some rather dark and chilling takes on the prototypical killer-in-the-woods types. Not only is this section of the film pretty dark, creepy and packed with plenty of chilling encounters but it also runs through some rather ingenious moments to keep this one going along quite nicely throughout as there's enough action and gore here to really satisfy here. Unfortunately, what doesn't work here is everything after that point which is the last half-hour of the film as this delves into an over-developed and needless exploration of what's going on that's not in the slightest bit clever, original or worthwhile. Trying to hide behind tons of gory bloodshed doesn't help disguise the fruitless endeavor this tries to undertake all in the name of trying to be original or clever and never is all that enjoyable for it. This isn't enough to really knock this down, but it's enough to lower this slightly.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Nudity and continuous drug use.",The Cabin in the Woods
2153,25,FlashCallahan,I'm still on speakerphone aren't I?.....,7/10,21 April 2012,"Thor and his friends go for a little getaway to the titular place for a weekend of typical cheesy eighties horror shenanigans.Then good old Joss Whedon nips past and tries to do a Kevin Williamson, rewriting the whole horror genre.The twist in this is in fact that the cabin is there for more sinister reasons, Men in shirts in an underground office are watching their every move and waiting with baited breath what they pick in the cellar.It decides not just their fate, but a lot of people.I've been waiting for three years to see this movie, even Hemsworth god fed up and became a god of thunder, but was it really really worth the wait.In short no.The film is good, and has some really innovative parts (the last twenty minutes could be the craziest thing i've seen on the screen in a long time, but when every scene featuring the titular place becomes boring compared to what is happening with two old men in an office, things are not right.First you must realise is that this film is Svi-Fi. It gas horror elements to it, but it's not your average horror flick. The scenes with the cabin and the teens are just too predictable, and whether this was the intention of the writers, i'm sure they didn't intend to bore the audience.The cast are fine, but what makes tis film so watchable is the casting of Jenkins and the other guy whose name escapes me as the ones who are making it happen. These are genuinely endearing scenes and the script sparkles with wit and intelligence, then we get back to the dull teens.So all in all it's a great shame that the titular place is boring, but calling this film 'Two men in an office' doesn't have the same ring to it.An whoever thought it would be a good idea to have a bird fly into the shield near the beginning, ruined what could have been one of the best 'deaths' in the whole film.Great last twenty minutes, great in the underground office, dull, dull, dull with the kids.",The Cabin in the Woods
2154,26,Wuchakk,A slasher flick with a creative twist and over-the-top climax,7/10,13 August 2016,"Released in 2012 and directed by Drew Goddard, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a slasher flick with satirical elements about five youths who take a getaway to a, you guessed it, cabin in the woods. Everything's not as it appears, however, and total havoc ensues.Right off the bat, the movie gives away the fact that something is going on behind the scenes with the cabin, as if the kids are being set-up for some diabolical purpose. I liked the cast and the movie was decent, but I was a little turned-off by the set-up angle, which I'll leave for you to discover. I just prefer more straight-forward storytelling. But the ridiculously over-the-top climax won my respect because there's no way I would've predicted what was really going on and the motive thereof. So the movie gets points for creativity.While ""Cabin in the Woods"" is somewhat satirical, it's not a horror comedy. It comes across as one of the Friday the 13th sequels with some Scooby-Doo elements thrown in. Chris Hemsworth plays the alpha male, Anna Hutchison the (too thin) blond hottie, Jesse Williams the studious dude, Fran Kranz the burnout and Kristen Connolly the virginal main protagonist (the true hottie). Amy Acker and Sigourney Weaver have peripheral roles. The filmmakers should've taken advantage of Amy's magnificent presence, but they failed. The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in British Columbia.GRADE: B",The Cabin in the Woods
2155,27,trashgang,finally one of the hyped flicks of 2012 that delivers,7/10,11 September 2012,"What is it with the year 2012, so many flicks are hyped and most of them I just couldn't care, we had The Hunger Games which I found boring. We had Detention which was okay for the effects but just didn't deliver what I expected from it. So a bit of anger to plug in the next hype. The Cabin In The Woods. Luckily for me this flick did deliver.But I must immediately say that I can understand why people hate it. It is an ode to the horror genre and also they laughed it loud out. Why it is an ode, face it. I see things coming straight out of The Evil Dead (1981) like the zombies being awaken by a book. I see some kind of Box used in Hellraiser (1987). I do see elements of Cube (1997) towards the end and even a bit of Wrong Turn (2003). And there's even so much more like the white masks, or the way the killer zombie looked. When we go to Japan, that also rings a bell. So much of an ode.But it never gave me some jumpscene's. You can see things coming from miles away and on the other hand there are things that you say, wow, what a surprise. And even one actress is here to see as a big surprise. Naturally being filed under horror you do need like in the old school horrors the whore, the dummy, the smart ass and so on. We do have it here, we even had a bit of nudity from Anna Hutchison (Jules). And of course our female heroin.The acting did also give it an upgrade. They all looked believable but be aware that some do exaggerate because it's needed in a comedy/horror like this. On part of the comedy I didn't laughed it out that much, there's one scene with the titties that is funny but that's it for me.The effects are amazing in some scene's and the end, well, that's were people discussing about. You like it or you hate it. All horror creatures ever released are watchable in The Cabin In The Woods. I loved it and finally one hyped flick of 2012 did deliver. Never that gory at all.

I never seen a horror movie begin like ""The Cabin in the Woods"" has. I never seen a movie end like this one did! The script has a few social messages hidden into the film. One, society/media tries to control people, and fit them into typecast people. Two, there is a few people who are conscious of this, 3 d thinkers, and figure things out. 3 the movie has a low opinion of human nature and believes that we get what we deserve.

2157,29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Cabin in the Woods,10/10,19 April 2012,"One of the best ways to thoroughly enjoy The Cabin in the Woods, is to steer clear of its trailer and go in blind. Don't read any reviews because there are plenty out there who are just plain lazy and in their plot summary hint at what's to come, or tend to reveal too much - heck, if you're that cautious, skip my review altogether, though I promise to tread really carefully. A film that's usually bad gets shelved for months before a release date, and this was delayed for 3 years, though due to its battle to resist being converted to 3D. Thankfully it stayed the way it is rather than to go into yet another senseless depth of field conversion that brings little value to the table, and along the way nothing else got created that resembled its brilliance, keeping it extremely fresh when seen for the first time.Written by Joss Whedon (whose next film The Avengers just can't wait to burst onto the big screens) and Drew Goddard who wrote Cloverfield, and episodes for television series such as Lost, Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the concept for The Cabin in the Woods is so fluid and probably easy to come up with if you're smoking something, working on many levels, and gives us all a reason why horror films play out the way they do. The writing duo takes the quintessential horror film ensemble of characters, and slaps on some fictional yet logical rationale, though keeping it thoroughly entertaining, and with the usual bag of tricks up the sleeves that every horror filmmaker out there would have dipped into from time to time, packing it with plenty of strong irony that drips in every scene.Goddard also takes on directing responsibilities, and his feature film debut demonstrates a keen eye for various genres, all incorporated seamlessly into this film. Laughter and satire are always close by, and I can't fathom another film that's remotely close to its offering of thrills, spills and laughter, not by a mile. There are plenty of moments where you're kept on the edge of your seat, with surprising twists and turns popping up every now and then, even when the film established its own ground rules early on that will probably give you a whiff of what's to come later in the narrative. You may think you have all the answers, but the final act provides clear cut answers, and throws just about everything from the horror genre onto the screen in one giant melting pot.What I really enjoyed about the film is its tongue-in-cheek treatment about competition from around the world, reflecting real life and how we view horror films in general, with each subsequent viewing of a particular film, or a sub-genre, sensitizing us to anything a filmmaker could possibly throw at us, leaving us jaded, and almost always a step ahead of the filmmakers. Here, there's a deliberate flag flying attempt that pokes fun at the return of US horror filmmaking brilliance in a less than subtle sequence, and in what I thought was an overt warning was not to celebrate before the chickens hatch, a reminder to focus on the task at hand until it gets completed rather than to rest on premature laurels.So step into The Cabin in the Woods, and throw all preconceived notions you think may happen along the course of the movie. You'll get some right, but trust me there are a lot more going on here with references so fast and furious that this is firmly set as one of the rare few horror films that begs repeated viewing. Highly recommended, and a shoo-in into the shortlist as one of this year's best!",The Cabin in the Woods

2159,31,siderite,A horror fan's wet dream,9/10,2 September 2012,"It is hard to review this film without giving things away. This alone should tell you that the movie is good. There is no cliché story and then a twist, so I can tell you the story and let you discover the twist. It's all twisted, so to speak.So let me tell you what this film isn't. It is not a prepackaged recipe that you know by heart but you still like to eat the end result. It is not a cinema starfest and/or an ego trip for some writer or director. The people in the leading roles are mostly TV series actors (except for Thor) while the people in the supporting roles are people we've known and loved for a while now. The film is not a bait and switch. Even if the explanation comes slowly, it does come. There are hints of what is going on all over the film even from the start. Nobody is dreaming stuff or is actually dead and doesn't know it or all that crap. What you see is what you get (even if it is not the same for the characters). There is no gratuitous humour or gore, but there is plenty of both.Bottom line: finally something original in horror movies. In a way, this is a meta movie: it explains all horror movies ever made and then laughs in the face of their predictability. ""It's time to give someone else a chance"" is a quote from the film and, I think, it was meant for the movie makers. All in all, a very enjoyable film.",The Cabin in the Woods
2160,32,StevePulaski,"You think you know, but you really don't know. And you never will.",8/10,21 April 2012,"Cultists and horror fans rejoice. The genre is long from dead. Especially since we have people like Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon hellbent on filing the rough edges and cementing the cracks. For years we have been met with shameless remakes, lame sequels, found footage disasters, and only once in a while does a solid, tolerable horror flick break through the bleak and droning clutter. Here, we have an original, crafty, and exciting flick in the genre that resorts to not only mocking the clichés commonly used in horror films but also possibly inventing some new ones of its own.This is the last thing I was expecting to say about a film titled The Cabin in the Woods, but after months of anticipation and article after article it has finally been released. I remember the original plot that was leaked on IMDb in January; ""Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods. Bad things happen."" I thought to myself ""you already have a film with a trite, uninspired title and now you release a plot that doesn't even try?"" Little did I know I was being played. I saw the first trailer and was mesmerized. What would appear to be a stock, wooden (pun intended) exercise mixed with a heap of tired, worn clichés was what looked to be a promising and intelligent horror film. Those thoughts stay with me after viewing as well.Usually in my reviews I try and give a sufficient description of the plot. For Cabin in the Woods, I refuse. You're left with your wits, your assumptions, and that simple premise I quoted. I went in with that knowledge and the camaraderie I witnessed in the trailers. There's absolutely no reason anything else has to be said or given away. The five characters are standard horror archetypes that we've seen a countless number of times, and the film isn't shy about reminding us. The last twenty-five minutes of the film are relentless and, by then, the movie's title seemed to be practically void and nonexistent to me.There's just one issue I have; the film seems to have swapped a lot of the horror elements for cheap, slightly-amusing comedy bits that sometimes obscure direction. I've never been too big on horror comedies, but it seems Cabin in the Woods would have benefited from more thriller elements than corny comedy skits.But that doesn't overshadow the fact that this is a bold and unrestricted film, so far off the map of typical horror-fare that some newer films aren't even in sight. Some readers might remember my abashed review of The Devil Inside, but my faith in horror has become somewhat restored after watching Cabin. I recently watched a documentary called Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope, which Cabin's screenwriter Whedon was a part of. Seeing as he was a long time writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and directed and wrote the upcoming superhero film The Avengers, it seems he speaks to the group of superfans and nerds. Those who camp out at night to be the first one to see a film, buy a game/console, or those who seek to form and join a number of cults. We need more people in the business like Whedon. I'm always weary when old directors try out new tricks. What does it tell us when Goddard and Whedon's Cabin in the Woods was more subtle, fulfilling, and fun than Wes Craven's My Soul to Take? It's also a blessing to see Cabin get a substantial release in 2D. Originally, when the rights were under MGM's name, an up-conversion to 3D was proposed and thankfully abandoned. I found parts of Cabin to be a tad dark and hazy. Glasses that add an extra dimension that noticeably dim the light of a picture would've tarnished the experience. Maybe if I had some of the stuff Marty (Kranz) had everything would become clear to me. Everything except the turns.Starring: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, and Bradley Whitford.

2162,34,KineticSeoul,Refreshing take on horror...Or horror/comedy,7/10,15 June 2012,"What this is, is a refreshing take on the horror genre because of the twist in the movie. You can see the twist sort of in the beginning but you won't entirely know exactly what is going on until it comes close to the end. This takes the very generic aspects of horror slasher flicks and sort of takes jabs at it in a fun way. Even all the college students are very generic to the horror genre. The pop culture horror elements are in this but not so it can head in a very generic slasher flick direction. This has been done before but it doesn't seem outdated at all so far. But it all has purpose, well majority of it. I can't really talk much about this movie cause it can ruin it for the viewers. But what I will did find a bit shocking is how the movie is a bit more humorous than scary. It's not like ""Shaun of the Dead"" funny but some situations are so awkward it gets pretty darn funny. Now I wasn't laughing hysterically throughout this movie but the humor actually blends in pretty well with the horror aspect of it. What first leads to a generic slasher flick with all the generic slasher flick elements leads to much more. I rarely watch slasher flicks more than once but this one I might see again. It's a good thing the trailer didn't give much of anything away which is rare for trailers now a days.7.6/10",The Cabin in the Woods
2163,35,Hellmant,A horror fan's wet dream!,10/10,22 April 2012,"'THE CABIN IN THE WOODS': Five Stars (Out of Five) The best reviewed movie of the year, so far, is this B slasher film from 'Nerd God' Joss Whedon! Whedon co-wrote and produced the film and his buddy, a usual partner in crime of his, Drew Goddard directed the film. The cast features new Whedon 'Go-To Man' Chris Hemsworth (who also plays 'Thor' in Whedon's upcoming 'AVENGERS' film). The film is a meta slasher flick spoof and the best of it's type since 'SCREAM' or possibly even 'EVIL DEAD II'! The story revolves around five friends going on vacation at a remote cabin in the middle of the woods owned by Curt's (Hemsworth) cousin. Despite being warned of danger by a creepy gas station attendant (Tim De Zarn) they continue to the cabin and also investigate it's mysterious basement, which is full of strange artifacts. Meanwhile they're being watched by technicians at a government facility and we learn they're guinea pigs in some kind of experiment. The film constantly winks it's eye at the viewer as it runs through every horror cliché imaginable.The movie is brilliantly tongue in cheek and the perfect homage to B horror films. The script is clever and the directing is perfectly fitting. The cast is all perfect in their roles (especially memorable turns from Fran Kranz, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford). It's hilarious as well as perfectly gruesome (a horror fan's wet dream) and the climax is more than any monster movie fan could ask for.

2164,36,thesar-2,This Cabin Gave Me the Fever,9/10,26 February 2013,"To avoid any kinds of spoilers, I will begin and finish this review with: I loved The Cabin in the Woods. See it. Thank you. Good-bye.(Man, I probably would double my fanbase all the way to two if all my reviews went like that)There's been such an internet uproar on spoilers for movies, this one in particular. So much so, I finally avoided all podcasts and all reviews – EVEN if they stated theirs didn't contain any. (Yeah, I know I am saying the same thing, so I understand if someone won't read this. But, allow me to assure you, I will NOT give anything away. It would be wrong on many accounts, but for the most part, this movie is plain fun as it progresses and divulging any secrets would ruin someone's amusement.)On a side note, sadly, one unhappy viewer on The Facebook® gave away one of the aspects I didn't know about. I quickly stopped reading and immediately dismissed their opinion thanks to ruining one part of this great film.This movie was, in fact, great, and as mentioned, it progressively got better – which was hard for me since I ABSOLUTELY loved the intro and film's title appearing on the screen. In fact, few impress me, but this would fall in the top three next to The Silence of the Lambs and the ""changed"" one from Death Proof.Generally, I give a synopsis, and perhaps I can give a general onefive youths, all stereotypical Breakfast Club molds and usually found in these ""cabin in the woods"" horror films, travel to said cabin to party, but things aren't gonna be easy and they might have listened to the old, tobacco spitting gas attendant warning them to go no further. Sound familiar?Oh, GOD, if it were that simple, it would turn most away. I, however, LOVE those types of films – and had wished the early 2012 release of Don't Go in the Woods would have been a 1/10 of that. But, I digress, that movie wasn't and this is dozens of times more fun, original, intelligent, scary and hilarious – namely I loved the character of Pothead Marty who delivered the funniest and surprisingly deepest lines. It surely nourished all I craved growing up and so much more.I can see the reviewer's POV of giving away spoilers, despite their wrong-doing. This movie is almost 97.5% impossible to describe without spoiling anything the trailer didn't provide. But, like that remaining 2.5%, it can be done and suffice to say: This is the best new movie I've seen in 2012 and should be seen by all horror (and horror-comedy) fans, especially ones like me – who grew up with horror all the way from the late 70s through to the 1990s horror.It was so good that any down time that's usually in the (honestly and I'm afraid) overused ""Cabin in the Woods"" horror story lines was filled with interesting, funny and fresh approaches. You cannot pinpoint pacing as a fault here or unoriginal ideas, EVEN with the same 'ole plot that's actually presented here.Summing this all up: if you're a horror-comedy fan, a (typically 1980s) ""cabin in the woods"" horror buff, you will love this fresh, exciting and bright approachdespite how dark it can be.Oops, I hope I didn't SPOIL anything there.",The Cabin in the Woods

2166,38,Robert_duder,"Fantastic twist to the horror genre, a bucket load of fun!!",9/10,16 September 2012,"I had heard very mixed opinions about Cabin In The Woods but fans like me always bank on Joss Whedon. He may not have directed the film but he clearly had a very heavy hand in the film because it reeks of Whedon and it rocks!! Cabin In The Woods takes the stereo typical often tired old horror genre and kicks it straight in the jewels. You could watch this film a hundred times and see something else...an homage to any number of horror films or little hidden easter eggs in the background of multiple scenes. You can easily find a little bit of every major horror film of the last twenty or more years in this movie. But it doesn't just spoof them and toss them aside, it weaves an intricate well told almost sci-fi story with solid performances, tongue in cheek humour, and a well made very old school ending and an INCREDIBLE evil villain cameo that made me cheer out loud (yes I'm that lame.) Is it a perfect movie? No. It did cram an awful lot into one movie and the old school ending may definitely come across as hokey to some but the movie is simply fun and thrilling and extremely entertaining.When I first saw Chris Hemsworth in Thor I immediately thought he was a one note actor who would never really go beyond Thor/Avengers but I admit right now I was wrong. I've seen him now in this and Snow White and The Huntsman and it turns out he was great in both. In this film he plays the jock type teen (who isn't even close to being a teen) and he plays the role well. He spoofs the characters but still makes it serious enough. Kristen Connolly is our scream queen, the ""virginal"" pure girl who always survives. She plays the role perfectly. She is sweet and nice but toughens up when it comes down to it. Anna Hutchison is the ""hot blonde"" of the group. She doesn't last long against the killers but then she isn't supposed to either. She serves her purpose though and her and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Fran Kranz (a Whedon-ite formerly of Dollhouse) plays stoner Marty. He was probably my favourite character because he was clearly smarter than the average horror flick stoner and surprises you in the end. He has great on screen charisma too. Jesse Williams (who I enjoy a lot on Grey's Anatomy is just okay in the nice guy role. He has good chemistry with Connolly but he is very underused and background fodder when it comes down to it. And finally I very much enjoyed the performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. Their dialogue with each other is perfect and keeps the pace going and they have some of the best, funniest and most clever lines in the film. Of course you also have the big bad cameo at the end but I won't mention who that is...except I was thrilled.This was director Drew Goddard's directorial debut and I don't mean to downplay the job he did but its very clear that Joss Whedon guided him a great deal. I don't know why he just didn't direct it himself. Either way it was very well directed and written by Goddard and Whedon together. Part of the film felt like an old school slasher flick like Friday the 13th but back when the series was in its stride, when it was truly excellent. Then you have a sci-fi feel to some of it, similar to that of the Resident Evil franchise, but you also have an original unique story that is done in its own way. Do yourself a favour horror fans and check this one out now!! 9/10",The Cabin in the Woods
2167,39,richardchatten,What Lies Beneath,8/10,6 August 2018,"The presence of Richard Jenkins in the opening sequence suggested that we were going to get something classier than the usual teenage slasher nonsense; but for quite a while the ghoulish build up seemed conventional enough.The cheerful amorality of the bad guys' manipulation of the likeable youngsters chosen to be their victims at first roused my indignation; but as all is eventually revealed I became increasingly relieved that the emphasis was going to be on providing an ingenious and well thought-out resolution rather than just the usual welter of blood. For which I was very grateful.

2168,40,bowmanblue,Wow - something a bit different!,8/10,9 March 2015,"Over the last ten years or so, so many horror movies have been labelled as 'genre-changing.' And most of them have been utter tosh - simply regurgitating tried and tested formulas, filled with annoying horror clichés and even more annoying screaming teenagers.Enter The Cabin in the Woods. I picked up on the hype before it was released and deliberately tried to avoid finding out too much about it as I wanted to be surprised.I was surprised indeed. It was actually pretty good. Yes, it's horror. However, there's not an awful lot of gore or scares if that's what you're looking for. Instead, it pays homage to classic horror films like Evil Dead and rips them off in a good way, while at the same time introducing a slightly new spin on the genre.It's about five teenagers who take a trip to a deserted cabin in the woods the come to a sticky end, one by one. Nothing particularly original there, but it's the overall package that makes it slightly different to the norm.I won't say too much in case you don't know about there whys and hows of it all. Basically, if you like cheesy B-movie style horror films and you want one with a different plot which pokes fun at the many horror clichés you've become accustomed (and possibly desensitised to) over the years, then give this one a go. It may just surprise you.I really liked this film, but, after reading various Internet reviews, I've found a fair few people didn't. Their criticism was that either it wasn't scary or horrific enough, or that they didn't understand it. A fair comment on the lack of gore and scares, but I think the point of the film isn't to make you throw your dinner up or have a heart attack out of fright - but more to try and make something new out of something old. As for not understanding it - yes, this one does take an ounce more understanding that just a maniac in an ice hockey mask cutting people up with a chainsaw. Pay careful attention to the scenes in the office style environment which are interspersed with the story of the teenagers in the cabin - it should answer all questions.",The Cabin in the Woods
2169,41,MLDinTN,a comedy posing as a horror story,7/10,8 February 2013,"This is a very misleading story. You think it is going to be about some kids go to a cabin in the woods and something creepy happens, like it's haunted or there are monsters. But in reality they are in a science experiment. We learn that a bunch of betting, goofy scientists have planned their trip to the woods without them knowing. And when the 2 survivors learn the truth, it gets really bloody and blows your mind as to what is really going on. And how are the Japanese kids so smart. I liked the originality of it all.FINAL VERDICT: Different, a unique twist on a horror story. If you like lots of blood, check it out.

It's a horror film that's self-aware, but too often it seemed to just become the thing itself, a dumb horror film. The human sacrifice to the Ancient Ones stuff was weird, and came at a point when the film had more than worn out its welcome.

2171,43,Cineanalyst,The Scary Show,8/10,3 August 2021,"Before the review proper, I'm going to try out a couple bad, brief jokes, or so-called ""meme reviews.""Ahem... first joke: even for claims that marijuana is a gateway drug, this is ridiculous.Second joke: Joss Whedon must be egotistical to suggest the world will end based on whether his horror movie is any good.OK, now that I've done my part to save the world by either those jokes killing or dying themselves from natural causes--if not, I'm sure the Japanese, or more popular social-media personalities, will slay it as always--I'll try to write some actual critical thoughts on ""The Cabin in the Woods."" It's post-""Scream"" (1996) horror-genre deconstruction and post-""The Truman Show"" (1998) reality-tv spoof. The main reflexive device here is that the teenagers are in a film within the film. Aside from their other plot devices--here it's the initial mystery of the relation of the two plots, in ""Scream it's the whodunit, and unrequited love with Truman--the main difference I think between this and something such as ""Scream"" is that this is more mocking. It's not always clear, perhaps because it's not the case, that there's simultaneously a love for the films that this one is making fun of. It's perhaps more akin to something along the lines of ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974) in that sense, where one may doubt Mel Brooks likes Westerns at all, as well as in the vein of ""The Truman Show."" That's fine by me, but it's admittedly a bit mean spirited--like joking about meme reviews by writing a couple bland ones.The deconstruction may be too incisive to be otherwise, as the picture does well to get at the simplistic conventions of many such trashy scary movies: the character tropes, their stupid behaviors, the oxymoronic sexual moralism combined with gratuitous nudity, the foreboding environs, and the generic monsters. Early on, if not for the escalating meta-ness, one may as well be watching one of the numerous hacky slashers in the tradition of, say, ""Friday the 13"" (1980)--and that's supposedly one of the best of its ilk. Most potentially insulting, one might consider this a metaphorical slap in the face of fans of such genre fare--the gods placated by formulaic slop made by engineer filmmakers just carrying out the same pattern time and again. If one diverges too much from the blueprint, subverts basic expectations, Adam Smith's invisible hand will be rendered visible CGI to reach out and end the movie, or something....Once the interior film (the film within the film) collapses and those remaining enter the outer film, making once surrogate, in-film filmmakers and spectators into participants in the horrors, though, it becomes a far more gleeful experience. What happened to Truman if they never stopped trying to prevent him from leaving, and he did anyways. Before that, it's arguably too much of an intellectual exercise in looking down on the genre and overly reliant on the albeit amusing interactions between Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. Easily one of the two best movies featuring Jenkins and a merman, by the way.... Maybe that should've been my meme review.",The Cabin in the Woods
2172,44,cricketbat,Horror fans will enjoy the ride,8/10,7 July 2018,"The Cabin in the Woods is a bit confusing at first, but if you hold on tight and pay attention, you're gonna enjoy the ride. This film eviscerates slasher movie archetypes and presents audiences with a unique and, frankly, smarter horror movie -- complete with Joss Whedon's trademark wit and clever writing. Plus, the climax won me over with a horror reference smorgasbord. I wasn't sure at first, but the more I think about this film, the more I like it.

2173,45,lesleyharris30,"At Times Thriling, Sometimes Funny, Never Consistent,",7/10,19 June 2017,"The Cabin in the Woods is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It's a very interesting concept that is executed very well, it also keeps us intrigued throughout, wondering what exactly is going on, and not truly finding what out the reason for these events are until the very end. The massive selection of movie monster is very impressive, and the sequence at the end was immensely thrilling. While I definitely get why some people would love the genre mix in this movie, I was not particularly fond of it. The film is half raunchy comedy, half straight up horror, but because of that it was never really consistent. There were moments where you could be in fear, and then suddenly hit with a ridiculous joke that completely took me out of it. They are both such different brands of film that they did not work out very much together for me. The character development is poor. I think the five young adults that we follow at the beginning should have been fleshed out more, as it is them we are following on this bizarre journey. We should have cared for all of them and want each one to come out of this alive, but we are never truly given a reason to. It is certainly entertaining, albeit never engrossing. A great story and terrific suspense, Cabin in the Woods has its flaws, but it's worth the watch if you are looking for a good horror, just do not go out of your way to see it. Five teens get far more than they bargained for when they spend a weekend at an isolated cabin. Best Performance: Richard Jenkins / Worst Performance: Anna Hutchison",The Cabin in the Woods

When five friends plan a weekend getaway to a secluded cabin things start off as planned. While relaxing at night they hear a strange sound, when the go off to investigate all hell breaks loose. One by one the friends begin to get killed off, then things start to get out of control. I have to admit that based off the few previews I saw this was not what I expected. I did enjoy it and it was a fun movie to watch though. The thing that kind of depressed me though is that this type of thing may not be that far away from reality. While there is the clichéd slasher movie aspects in this it is not your typical slasher type movie. This one had equal parts comedy and horror. That combination may turn off a lot of horror fans, but to me that made it a really fun experience. If you are looking for a true horror/slasher like ""Friday the 13th"" this is not it. If you are looking for a good time and a horror you can laugh at then this is what you are looking for. Overall, a very fun experience. A comedy/horror that is worth checking out.

But for every true fan of horror, with at least a basic knowledge of at least cult horrors through the history of the genre, this should be a real joy. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a weird movie that can not be precisely genre determined. It gathers horror ideas seen countless times and turns them upside-down. Nothing in this movie is new, but the greatest thing about it is its ability to make something very original using totally outworn horror cliches. This is a parody and homage at the same time. It is a funny-scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one-liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute.

2178,50,tabuno,A Dour Cliché Breaking Sci-Fi/Horror Movie,7/10,13 January 2019,"22 February 2016. A very dark and genre breaking horror/sci fi fusion movie. From Buffy: The Vampire Slayer fame, Josh Whedon, comes this cliché aversion thriller that begins as a college prat party and transforms into a hard science fiction movie devolving into a horror drenched movie into a fusion of sci-fi and horror without the redeeming values of Buffy. The script and plot seem to have been patched together in rather sterile hotel rooms where the creators were allowed to go wild and break the traditional story lines of sci fi and horror. The end result is surprising, twisting, and is swallowed whole like Planet of the Apes (1968).Cabin has fewer elements from Buffy than it's an adult version of Cube Zero (2004) along with the horror elements borrowed from Thir13teen Ghosts (2001) and Cell (2000). Overall, it's a fun but creepy and rather dour film experience. For perhaps an even more elevated sci-fi, horror experience check out:THX-1138 (1971) Brazil (1985) Silent Hill (2006) 1408 (2007) Black Death (2010) The Awakening (2010) The Host (2013)",The Cabin in the Woods

2180,52,The-Sarkologist,What would be a boring horror film is actually a brilliant satire,8/10,9 June 2013,"I don't know what attracted this film to me, maybe it was the cover, maybe it was somebody saying that they can't wait to see Cabin in the Woods, so when I was wondering through the video shop I decided to pick it up to see what it was all about. In one word I would describe this movie as 'strange'. Actually I have two words that would basically describe this film, but IMDb won't actually let me write that, so I will simply say 'incredibly twisted'.The first strange thing I found with the movie was that it opened in some sort of top secret research facility with a couple of scientists chatting away about nothing in particular and that is what caught me at first. However, the movie then jumped to the scene with the college aged kids going away on some camping trip in the woods and that was when I groaned and said 'oh no, not again.' As the movie progressed I sort of groaned even more, especially when the zombies came out of the ground. I was sort of like the guy in the film that said 'why can't we have mermaids!' My response was 'yeah! Why can't we have mermaids.' After cruising through some of the message boards I then realised why we couldn't have mermaids, and that was because this movie is actually satirical. The thing was that despite all of the clichéd slasher horror movie scenes, we kept on jumping back to this research facility (including a scene where there is a betting pool) but the director is clever because he does actually keep you guessing about what is going on. We hear about the betting pool, but we have no idea what this pool is until after the event in which they are betting on. In fact, you have no idea what the connection between the research facility and the happy (or not so happy) campers is until about halfway during the film. Mind you, there are some hints, and the stoner character (the college kid characters are all clichéd) seems to have a better idea than most (namely because the copious amount of weed that he smokes actually counter acts the drugs that are being used on them).It is halfway through the film that it actually gets interesting, and in fact it is the purge (I won't mention what that is) that is actually my favourite part of the film. The thing is that this is a twist, and despite the fact that I have listed this commentary as containing a spoiler does not mean that I am going to give it away. You see, this is a satire, and it is a satire that pokes fun at all of the standard fare horror films that Hollywood churns out. While the cabin in the woods is considered to be standard fare (popularised by Evil Dead, where it was actually done properly) only one of the many clichés that are there. The major cliché is not only that everybody has to die (and in a particular order) but also that the who genre, the murder, killing, blood, and gore, is actually created to placate an ancient god, and that ancient god is the audience.",The Cabin in the Woods

2183,55,briancham1994,This is how to do a parody,7/10,4 June 2020,"After the ""parody"" movies of the 2000s comes The Cabin in the Woods, a lesson in how to poke fun at a genre while still telling a compelling story. It incorporates all the clichés of the horror genre but in a clever way that all ties together. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, the film goes off the rails and goes into completely new territory.

2184,56,tomgillespie2002,Very knowing of horror history,6/10,20 August 2012,"Over the past thirty or so years, the horror and science-fiction genre's of cinema have created vast armies of devotional fanatics, that they have somehow become somewhat powerful within the film making world. We now lovingly call them ""fanboys"", and as a public we view them as geeks. However, in the genre cinema world, their opinions, and attentions upon the minutia of a particular film, or film series, can sometimes alter the direction the film makers were originally going to take on the film. The horror genre is certainly one of these more scrupulously deconstructed filmic forms, perfectly illustrated with Wes Craven's Scream (1996 - 2011) films. But what The Cabin in the Woods does within this deconstructionist context, is to actually take a stab at criticising the level of involvement in the making of a film of the fanboy's, and their connection with keeping something almost uniform, such as if the ""conventions"" of a genre are changed, it becomes an issue for the gimpy-kids.Writer Joss Whedon and writer/director Drew Goddard have constructed a rather witty, and intelligent screenplay, that does everything within it's power to keep the conventions of a kids-go-to-the-woods horror movie. We follow five friends as they go to a remote cabin. They meet a desolate garage owner, who has no ""gas"". They begin acting within film- world stereotypes, and horror film images build. However, parallel to this action, we follow two white-collar workers begin their day at a production studio, pushing buttons at a console. These suit and collar workers structure, manipulate, and construct the horror narrative, making sure that every detail adheres to the set conventions.OK, so it could be argued that this is simply another criticism of reality television, and another apocalyptic view of our future entertainment. I would have to say that it is a little more complex than that notion. Whilst the films poster visualises a mechanical nature of this ""puzzle house"", the films secrets do not fully expose themselves to the climax. With many, many references to other horror films, - The Evil Dead (1982), gets the most - and a finale that will have horror fans delighted (if somewhat perplexed if they ""get"" it). The script is very knowing of horror history, and manages to maintain interest throughout, despite its more metaphysical concept. It's also good to see that Joss Whedon is finally getting the opportunity to flex his more cinematic muscles, instead of his usual relegation to television.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Cabin in the Woods
2185,57,poe426,"Doobie-doo- and Scraggy, too...",1/10,13 November 2012,"Sometimes it pays to read the fine print- but I wasn't paying attention: I glimpsed the trailer and thought that this was a remake of Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD. Which it ain't. Sorta. It's a limp-wristed attempt to cash in on the SCREAM formula, with a dash of WESTWORLD thrown into the mix. In the process, it manages the amazing feat of dumbing down the old SCOOBY-DOO cartoons- a show made for American children with Special Needs! At no point in the proceedings- not ONCE- did I feel empathy for ANY of the cardboard cut-outs; the unleashing of the cgi didn't make it any easier to sympathize with them, either. (It's yet another of those man-versus-cgi scenarios that leaves one wondering just what the **** the filmmakers were thinking when they conceived it.) Giver a pass.",The Cabin in the Woods
2186,58,filipemanuelneto,"A satire that didn't work very well, at least for me.",2/10,24 July 2021,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I was very disappointed in it, because I thought it would be a serious horror movie. I probably started from the same base as a lot of people, and I was wrong. It's not a horror movie, it actually works as a satire of genre, and if we look at it in that light, our vision of the film changes radically.The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling to an isolated cabin in the woods for a weekend of alcohol, drugs and some sex. We've seen this a thousand times, and we already know how it ends: in a bloodbath. But in this case, the cabin in question is just the tip of a large underground iceberg: a secret facility built under it, where a group of government-looking officials and scientists seem to be running a kind of international conspiracy, from which that experiment is part of it.The movie isn't particularly good, and it can really irritate those who, as I was at first, are looking for something really good to see. This is the problem with satirical films, and the horror genre is certainly the most satirized in cinema. Anyway, if we accept the film as it is, it will make it much better and more palatable, even if we have to put aside any logic and coherence: the story told by this film is surreal, to be nice, and the end is, to say the least, illogical.The movie's cast is equally forgettable. The loudest name is Chris Hemsworth, who will reach consecration in the ""Thor"" franchise and in the movie ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". However, the actor is frankly average here. Anna Hutchison is just a pretty face and a nice pair of bare breasts, in a brief segment of a hotter scene. Fran Kanz and Jesse Williams have nothing in particular to add, and Kristen Connolly is obviously the one who has been destined from the start to survive it all. In the lab, Richard Jenkins (the Walter from ""The Visitor"") and Bradley Whitford are the most outstanding actors, but they don't do much.Technically, it's a film that doesn't have much to offer either, as it was made on a limited budget. The cinematography is within the standard in use, the sets and costumes are fine, with an evident emphasis on the house and laboratories that underlie it. The CGI used was good, but the harshest and most violent scenes are emptied of emotion and look cold on closer inspection.",The Cabin in the Woods

Finally a worthy horror film with elements of comedy that's in a class of its own. I held off for a long time to watch this because most of my friends said they didn't like it. But they saw it with blinders on, and expecting to see something done before, and this film is not that. This film has redefined the horror genre.Mad props to the writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard for what I think is their best work, including outstanding directing in his directorial debut for Drew.The imagination that went into this film is what kept me on the edge of my seat. Sure there was your typical horror monsters you've seen in other horrors - ALL other horrors, but it doesn't stop there. A Unicorn as a killer?! Outstanding! I don't want to give any more away, but if you're going to see this, see it with open eyes and an open mind. This will rock your senses and sense of sensibility. And you will laugh your AO!All the actors where perfect in their roles, and I do mean all... I can't think of any role that could have been cast better.To all the haters comparing this to that, or what should have or have not happened... relax, take a deep breath and learn to enjoy. Appreciate a new level of horror/thriller/comedy... I did. THIS, is how it should be done! I hope this film has a long lasting following and becomes legendary in what I feel is a new modern twist to the horror genre.Bravo to all... a well deserved perfect 10/10!",The Cabin in the Woods
2189,61,Tweetienator,In the Woods Always Hell Awaits,7/10,19 October 2018,"The Cabin in the Woods seems to split the audience in people who like it and people who dislike it. But a rate of 1-3 of course is total nonsense: the movie is a comedy and therefore (like some reviewers stated) can't be ""abysmal"" to the horror genre, well, it's no horror movie but a horror-comedy (even a parody)...What we get is a very pro production, a lot of references to different more or less iconic movies of the horror genre, a pro cast (Hemsworth, Connolly) and some indeed unique and funny ideas - how one can ""hate"" this movie or give it a rating below 4 is really beyond my imagination.If you like horror-comedies, this one is certainly going to entertain you in a good way.

2190,62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"'The Cabin in the Woods' Meets Your Expectations, Then Destroys Them",9/10,21 April 2012,"The horror genre clings onto and feeds off of audience expectations. From a fan perspective, horror-lovers tend to flock to films that appear as if they will evoke the feelings of previous successes, even to the point of supporting blatant mimicry. From a filmmaking perspective, a horror director's go-to card is expectation—the audience recognizing those classic audio and visual clues that create the anticipation of a scare.The entire horror genre is built on the foundation of what we think will happen, so when ""The Cabin in the Woods"" comes along and utilizes these expectations while also blowing the roof completely off them, it makes for a wildly entertaining success.Sure, some folks will want a run-of-the-mill ""cabin in the woods"" story, the one we've seen a thousand times thanks to paragons ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Evil Dead"" among others. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" might let down those purists who rank the scare factor as top priority, but for fans of parody and satire, this is a must-see.The minds behind the film suggest a certain intelligence you won't find in horror offerings from amateurs. Drew Goddard, writer of ""Cloverfield"" and on TV's ""Lost,"" and Joss Whedon, one of the most revered names in geek culture, team up on a script that delivers a great deal of wit and at the same time a strong mystery, a combination that makes for an irrepressibly exciting movie.""The Cabin in the Woods"" requires a certain amount of aversion to spoilers in order to be fully enjoyed, though so many unsuspected twists crop up that a few details won't actually ruin anything. Essentially, five college kids head to a remote cabin for the weekend and predictably ignore some tell-tale signs that something's amiss. The catch is that despite seeing this setup before, we as an audience don't even quite know what's going on this time around. The fact that the film doesn't open on a cabin, woods, or college kids is your first hint.Perhaps the biggest surprise has nothing do with the plot: the young protagonists are somewhat likable and the actors portraying them have a good deal of talent. Nearly everyone will recognize Chris Hemsworth (Thor himself) as Curt, but the highlights are unknowns Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz as Dana and Marty, one an attractive bookworm and the other a clever stoner. The characters fit your horror stereotypes, but each with a bit of a twist that makes them more respectable. Even the ""dumb blonde"" (Anna Hutchison) isn't that dumb as she cares about her friends. Heck, the fact that these five would all be friends is kind of a jab at stereotypes.Strong writing reinforces the fact that these are more developed characters and shows Goddard and Whedon recognize that even though the goal is to turn the genre upside down, their film still needs to do the things good horror films do right in order to succeed.Without giving anything away, the central idea behind the movie is basically to give a mythology to a typical horror story motif such as the cabin in the woods, to weave it together with a science-fiction yarn that allows us to look at the genre both with humor and a greater reverence.""The Cabin in the Woods"" provides pure entertainment of a brilliant sort, an absolute rarity in any genre, let alone horror. With some pitch-perfect casting in roles best kept a secret, Goddard and Whedon sell their twist with great effectiveness. In hindsight, the whole operation could have backfired had there been just the slightest reason not to stay interested or care about the characters.Anyone with a keen eye for or love of satire and a familiarity with the horror offerings being played off of will find themselves on the exact same page as Goddard throughout the film. Consequently, these folks will simply love ""The Cabin in the Woods."" It's one thing to poke fun at a genre—anyone can do that, especially in horror. This movie does it without flopping into silly mindless spoof territory, instead entertaining us exactly as a traditional horror riff would.Although you won't see critical accolades because genre films get no love, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" will get its due when it appears on countless Best of 2012 lists—unless more and more 2012 movies that aren't supposed to be this good soar beyond expectations.~Steven CThanks for reading!

2191,63,Vartiainen,Absolute blast,9/10,8 January 2014,"Five college kids - the jock, the party girl, the innocent girl, the hippie and the nerd - all decide to spend a holiday on a remote cabin, swimming, grilling, drinking, all around partying. Yet all is not as it seems.Sound familiar? Yes, it's the done-to-death, classical B-horror movie plot about young adults getting into trouble, with lots of gore, screaming and the dumb blond always dies first. Am I right? And dare I guess that you honestly couldn't care less about another one? Luckily for you, this film is not just another B-horror movie. It's all that and more. With The Cabin in the Woods, director Joss Whedon delves into one of his all time favourite genres, yet he's not content just directing a really good scream fest. He knows the genre inside out, he knows all the tricks, all the clichés, all the conventions, and just like with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he wants to take all these and turn them upside down while still staying true to them.I cannot really say it otherwise, this movie is amazing. It plays all the clichés right from the very start, except when it suddenly veers into the exact opposite direction, only to immediately pounce back when you least expect it. It's a constantly surprising, constantly thrilling and constantly exciting roller coaster of jokes, hidden meanings, lampshade hangings and parodies. And yet it's a fine horror movie in its own right. It's that and more.And that's pretty much all I can say about the movie without spoiling your fun. On the technical side of thing, I have no complaints. It's well-acted, well-shot, well-produced film, but its biggest value lies in its vision, its idea that's all Whedon. Trust me, if you're a fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to watch this film. You've never seen anything quite like it.",The Cabin in the Woods
2192,64,gwnightscream,"""Pretty Good Horror Flick!""",6/10,5 October 2012,"Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Fran Kranz, Anna Hutchinson, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford and Amy Acker star in this 2012 horror film. This film tells of 5 teens, Dana (Connolly), Curt (Hemsworth), Marty (Kranz), Jules (Hutchinson) and Holden (Williams) heading to a cabin in the woods for the weekend and become attacked by zombies and creatures. That's not all, they soon discover they're part of a sacrificial test ran by technicians, Sitterson (Jenkins), Hadley (Whitford) and Lin (Acker) preparing for the end of the world. This is a pretty good horror flick that pays homage to popular horror flicks like, ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead."" There's great make-up effects and Sigourney Weaver also appears. I recommend this.",The Cabin in the Woods
2193,65,billcr12,Average Horror Movie,6/10,24 August 2012,"Five college students; three boys and two girls take an RV to a cabin in the woods to get away from it all. You have the jock, the pot head, the scholar, the slut, and the virgin. They get to the cabin and find strange things in a cellar, including a diary written partially in Latin. In the meantime, a group of people in a high tech place are watching TV monitors tracking the five unsuspecting kids. They can control the conditions of the environment, and Oscar nominated Richard Jenkins(for The Visitor) is the head of this mysterious experiment in terror. While in the woods, zombies appear, making the boys and girls stay rather unpleasant. The Night of the Living Dead meets The Running Man as more blood thirsty creatures arrive on the scene. The young victims are standard horror movie fodder, and Jenkins is well above the rest of the cast and the material. Sigourney Weaver also makes a brief cameo, thirty plus years after Alien. Overall, a little better than average.

2194,66,BeneCumb,"Decent acting, mediocre plot",5/10,8 December 2012,"I am quite selective in watching zombie movies, I like a few of them, but all from 1960-70ies or their later remakes. But The Cabin in the Woods... Hm, combining manhunt for money, zombies from the recent past and medieval dragons does not necessarily mean that all categories of viewers fond of them separately would be fond of them together in one. The outcome is at times funny, then stupid and the total summary is a ""porridge"" of this and that... Not impressive.Actors-actresses were also nothing special, even Sigourney Weaver's character was too briefly on screen. Well, it can still be that I do not belong into a target audience, that the movie is meant for teens and twinks - as all the main actors are in their 20ies. Nevertheless I know that there are better horror movies out there. Just search IMDb.com!

2195,67,dfranzen70,"Cabin in the Woods, that is where we are...",8/10,4 November 2012,"The Cabin in the Woods is never quite what it seems, which is precisely, exactly what you want a suspense-horror movie to be. You don't show the slashing! You don't show the thing that's coming at you! You hide things in shadows, under layers, beneath covers, physically and, more importantly, psychologically. Consequently, the movie messes with your mind, annihilates any preconceived notions you may have about the genre, and the invites a cataclysm of morbid monstrosities into your living room. It's an honest-to-goodness scary movie.Cowritten by Joss Whedon, the movie follows a pretty standard premise: a group of five stereotypes journey to a remote cabin for the weekend, and bad things happen when they venture into the basement on a dare and read from an ancient tome. Now, if you're not in on the joke - that is, no one's spoiled it for you - you're probably nodding right now in recognition. This is what happens in these movies. This is not new. To add to that, your characters are straight out of central casting: a jock, a pretty girl, a wallflower, a stoner, and a smart dude. It seems too trite to be true, and it most certainly is.The movie intentionally deals in tropes from all kinds of scary movies. Zombies. Zombie families. Ghosts, blobs, redneck hillbillies with chainsaws. Cave-ins. By now, you're reading this and, still naive to the actual plot, are starting to catch on. You see, this is what the Scream movies should have been. You remember those, right? They loudly and proudly proclaimed they were ""in on the joke,"" but with every known horror-movie rule they explained to a knowing audience, the characters in that movie broke another one. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.But not here, oh no. Our characters are never in control of anything. They aren't wiseasses; they're just caricatures, symbols of certain archetypes. They make their choices and deal with the consequences. If a game is being played, it's not rigged in their favor; it may not, in fact, be really rigged at all.It isn't long into the movie that we learn the cause of our heroes' distress. It would be unfair to detail it here, but let's just say that others can see every move they make and that there is apparently plenty more at stake than the lives of five measly young adults. In addition to the thrills that the movie offers, there's a great contrast between what the characters experience (as mere victims) and what goes on behind the curtain. When the audience realizes this, the movie...well, it's a whole new movie. Suddenly it's not about the fate of those five, it's about a heck of a lot more than that. Or less than that, if one doesn't buy the given premise at that turning point. There are few recognizable names in the cast. Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, and even Sigourney Weaver show up. They're not the focus here. What will be recognizable are the monsters, the breadth of which cannot be overstated. The action at its best is so frantic it might take a DVD pause to spot a particular baddie. There's mayhem, there's a lot of bloodletting, there's gore, and there's a visceral sense of satisfaction that cannot be simply slapped together by amateurs playing movie makers.For me, Cabin in the Woods was terrifying, and in the gleeful, do-it- again way. I don't think it means to be realistic, even in its created environment. It's scary in the jolts and the surprises and the smack- you-in-the-face action. Does it seem like I'm gushing too much? Not half as much as blood gushes in the movie. Okay, that was a cheap shot, but it was fun to type. This is an essential scary movie.",The Cabin in the Woods
2196,68,dee.reid,Just when you thought you'd seen it all... you hadn't,9/10,12 October 2012,"""The Cabin in the Woods,"" directed by Drew Goddard (screenwriter of 2008's ""Cloverfield"") and co-written by himself and Joss Whedon (""Firefly""), is a crystal-clear example that you truly haven't seen it all from the horror genre. I'm sure we've all just about given up on horror movies these days, but ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is the proof we need to shake us out of our delusion.""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a delightful send-up of ""dead teenager"" movies, using the Cabin in the Woods set-up that's so popular in movies like ""The Evil Dead"" (1982), Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" (2002), and even ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978); I'm actually quite certain there's more - OK, a lot more - but it's 11:00 at night and I can't quite think of horror movie names right now. It also throws in heavy elements of zombie movies and slasher movies for good measure. (Who said original horror movies are a lost art these days?)The story follows five college students (Kristen Connolly as Cute Virgin Girl Dana, Chris Hemsworth as College Football Jock Curt, Fran Franz as Bleary-eyed Stoner/Paranoid Conspiracy Theorist Marty, Jesse Williams as Stalwart Nice Guy/Scholar Holden, and Anne Hutchison as the Slutty Dumb Blonde Jules) as they take a break at a remote Cabin in the Woods; note that they're all blatant horror movie stereotypes being lined up for an imminent slaughter. A night of bloodshed and terror ensues. In a parallel - yet brilliantly, brazenly inter-connected and constructed, and also equally important - plot-line featuring faceless bureaucrats, things quickly become a witty essay on Hollywood horror movie narratives. To divulge any further details, destroys the surprises in store for you.It's amazing the way that ""The Cabin in the Woods"" cuts between its two parallel story lines; witnessing this in action, I savored expert classical craftsmanship on the part of both Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon and their equally talented young cast members and film crew. Both are alive & kicking, and one directly influences the actions of the other (this aspect of the picture is later flipped on its head late in the film). And did I mention that this is pretty funny, in addition to being occasionally gripping and scary?""The Cabin in the Woods"" is genuinely scary in an old-school fright-fest way. It's also funny in a uniquely self-aware, post-""Scream"" fashion that doesn't threaten to drift into full-blown camp territory. Even though it still exists in the post-""Scream"" void of self-knowing horror movies, the movie actually reminds me a lot more heavily of Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me to Hell"" (2009), which also went straight for scares/jump scenes with a sly sense of humor under-cutting the action. And ""The Cabin in the Woods"" does have some impressive scenes of gory violence featuring - what else? - dead teenagers.""The Cabin in the Woods"" is a unique breath of fresh air for a genre that definitely needed a huge breath of fresh air.9/10",The Cabin in the Woods

A typical group of American Horror Movie victims is placed in a scenario where they have to inadvertently pick their monster and be killed in order to appease ancient gods, all organized by a corporate bureaucracy who are competing to make sure that they beat their competition, who are staging a parallel Japanese Horror Movie.(A funny line, ""How hard is it to kill a bunch of nine-year olds?"" when their Japanese counterparts fail.) The victims escape the trap involving zombies and encounter werewolves, Cenobites and other ""not quite violating someone else's copyright"" monsters before Sigourny Weaver shows up to provide exposition.Josh, I love you man, but I never cared about any of these characters.

Part self-referential tongue-in-cheek a'la the first Scream and part identity crisis horr-edy in the same ballpark as Shaun of the Dead, it adds a bevy of original salts and spices and emerges as something completely different. I was told to avoid spoilers like the plague, and I'd strongly advise you to do the same - it's not a premise that translates well to explanation, and half the fun lies in the viewer's slow internal realization of where it's headed. Brilliantly paced, unrelentingly funny, thoroughly unpredictable and boldly written, (with an ending so ballsy and appropriate, I wanted to stand up and cheer) this is one of the most bright, daring, original efforts I've seen in years. Great fun that may be directed particularly at hardcore fans of the genre, it's just opaque enough for casual viewers to have a ball, too.

The whole thing is rather adorable in how it seems to think it has something to say beyond ""these are horror tropes"".People keep mentioned a ""twist"" but there isn't one.

2201,73,estebangonzalez10,A rare and unpredictable horror film,7/10,24 September 2012,"¨They have to choose what happens in the cellar. Yeah, we write the game as much as we have to but in the end, if they don't transgress they can't be punished. ¨ I'm not big on horror films since I generally consider them to be very predictable and cliché. I can't remember what the last horror slasher movie I enjoyed was since the few I do enjoy have to do more with psychological scares. All these movies are the same, but to my surprise it wasn't the case with Cabin in the Woods. I had no idea what direction this movie was moving towards and despite not being a fan of the genre I was able to appreciate Cabin in the Woods thanks to the unpredictability of it and some interesting performances. The less you know about this film before watching it the better. Like the tagline of the movie suggests, this film works as sort of a satire of all the slasher films we've grown up with. ¨If something is chasing yousplit up, ¨ is one of the taglines that is so cliché about these movies and it's addressed in this film as well. There are several elements that are sort of dissected in this movie and analyzed through satire and that's what I enjoyed the most about Cabin in the Woods. I didn't care for the scares (which aren't here) or the gore, what I really liked was that this film was making fun of the genre while at the same time paying homage to it so that fanboys would also enjoy it. It works almost in the same way that Scream did in the late 90's by making fun of the stereotypes of the genre. This film has an ending every fanboy will enjoy. It was a little too much for me since I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I still have to admit I was really surprised by this film. It is definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time.Despite the fact that the trailers give away a lot of the movie I will only give away the basic part. You have the five typical teenagers you see in most horror films decide to go spend a weekend at an old and mysterious cabin in the woods: the jock, Curt (Chris Hemsworth), the slut, Jules (Anna Hutchison), the stoner, Marty (Fran Kranz), the nerd, Holden (Jesse Williams), and the virgin, Dana (Kristen Connolly). The five play characters we are all familiar with in this genre. On their way to the woods they even run into an old gas station with a weird owner named Mordecai (Tim de Zarn) who really only lacks a sign in front of his forehead saying ¨Do not go into the woods if you want to live.¨ Once the teens arrive at the beautiful place they begin to party as they usually do, but later strange things begin to happen and they realize that they might not be alone in that place. You probably have seen this scenario a million times before in these films, but it takes a totally different turn and if you're a fan of the genre you will be in for a treat. Character actors Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford also give some strong secondary performances as they usually do.Cabin in the Woods combines a lot of gore with laughs. I can't say scares because there is hardly any. I like the way the film poked fun of its usual stereotypes and played with them while at the same time paying homage to several classic horror films. This was Drew Goddard's first film as a director and he really delivers. He had the credentials necessary considering he wrote and produced several Buffy, Angel, and Lost episodes as well as Cloverfield. He also co-wrote this brilliant and bizarre script with Joss Whedon, one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood (The Avengers, Toy Story, and Serenity). The script is smart although I must say that it was bizarre as well, but in a good way. Fans will have a terrific time with this movie, and those of us who criticize most slasher films for their predictability will be surprised by the twists taken here. It is a very original film which isn't afraid of taking risks or making fun of itself. The highlight of the film for me was Fran Kranz's performance. Most of the characters in this movie were really likable, as opposed to most horror films where they are hateful and forgettable. Cabin in the Woods is a very interesting and unique film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Cabin in the Woods

2203,75,jimbo-53-186511,The most frightening thing about this film is its absurdly high IMDb rating,2/10,20 December 2013,"Oh dear! Cabin in the Woods is so bad I hardly know where to begin. The film combines elements of other films such as Night of the Living Dead (the zombies), Saw 2 (cameras hidden in the house). Unfortunately, the execution of this film is nowhere near as good as other films in the same genre.The biggest issue for me was that the whole film was completely predictable. The use of cheap jump tricks throughout - there wasn't one occasion when I was shocked/scared throughout the entire 95 minutes of the film. This film has clearly just gone for shock value to try and get cheap scares rather than focusing on a well constructed and creepy story.The dialogue was painfully bad for the majority of the film (particularly the first 15 minutes) which consisted of mostly inane and meaningless conversations between 3 of the protagonists.Speaking of the protagonists we have 5 walking clichéd 1 dimensional cardboard cut outs Dana (the goody goody virgin) Curt (the jock) Jules (the whore) Holden (the intellectual) and Marty (the stoner/fool). That's about as much as I can say about them as we learn nothing else about them through the rest of the film. This didn't bother me that much as they were all uninteresting characters anyway.Once our 5 protagonists arrive at the Cabin, we learn that 4 out of the 5 have been marked for death. Jules (the whore) must die first as she is corrupted and the others die by whatever method they have selected for their death. The only one that has the option to live or die is the Virgin, but the director wants the Virgin to live and for the other 4 protagonists to die as part of a ritual sacrifice in order to appease the Gods beneath. The director (in a brief appearance by Sigourney Weaver) tells us that the reason that the protagonists are selected for death is because they are young. I found this to be a bit preposterous and lacking in sense, but I suppose it was at least somewhat original.As I said in my summary, the most frightening aspect about this film is its current IMDb rating of 7.5. It is a mystery to me why so many people liked this film so much - it has every horror cliché in the book, zero scares, dreadful dialogue. The film seemed to get worse as it went along and the final 15 minutes were just embarrassing. What a waste of 95 minutes!!",The Cabin in the Woods
2204,76,davispittman,Mixed feelings....,6/10,22 March 2015,"This movie starts out like any other, with the clichés and typical horror movie stupid teens, but then takes a complete 180!! They resurrect a bunch of zombies, that office people are controlling, and making sure that everyone dies when they are supposed to, and so on and so forth. I didn't like how light hearted they felt about killing innocent people, I found that to be offensive. Although it is original and rather clever. Then 2 of them figure out what the heck's going on, but wait, then Sigourney Weaver shows up, and explains how the gods of the earth must have a sacrifice of stupid teen blood in a certain order, or the world will END. And Of course the world ends up ending, which I don't Really like it when a movie ends with the destruction of the entire earth, I feel empty about it, since the world ended, although thus film was entertaining and very original. Also I love how those 2 office guys died, and I adore Sigourney Weaver, so I was happy to see her! 6/10!",The Cabin in the Woods

Th whole concept of people faking cabin in the wood killing with real monster just to please gods is interesting, sadly it could have been so much better.

Learning what's going on as the story unravels was a lot of fun. It's well cast, with a good script and some cool effects. It feels more like a comedy than horror, but pays tribute to the horror elements of film history. I think some of the people giving it negative reviews were expecting it to be scary. They might also have a problem with the ending, but...go big or go home, right?

2207,79,3xHCCH,I'm Buying Whedon's Wild Theory,8/10,2 May 2012,"""A Cabin in the Woods"" had received so much critical praise as an excellent horror film, so this horror movie fan could not resist a bait like that. I did not read anything about the plot nor have I seen the trailer before going into the theater this morning. What can I say, this must be one of the most convoluted horror stories ever put in screen!It starts with a couple of old guys in an unspecified company talking about their mundane lives. Then, the focus cuts to some college kids who were about to go on a road trip. It is only later when you see the connection between these two disparate sets of characters. We would then see a situation seen in countless horror flicks where the characters are trapped in a lonely cabin in the God-forsaken woods where they are killed off one by one by zombie rednecks. But is that all there really is to it?The five college kids are stereotypical of what we see in practically every horror movie we had ever seen before: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. Cliché you say, but this literally multi-layered script by wunderkind writer Josh Whedon (who just gave us the masterpiece called ""The Avengers"") would actually attempt to explain why these five characters should be present in all horror movies all over the world. I know that sentence probably made no sense, but that is the main premise of this over-reaching screenplay. You would never imagine what the bigger story would be, and who actually gets to deliver the explanatory lines towards the end. Acting is not a focus here, and it may actually be intentionally bad as a send-up to most horror flicks. Chris Hemsworth does not really act or look like Thor here, and could actually be played by any jock actor and would not make a difference. The computer-generated effects were excellent especially in the grand mayhem scenes where practically all the horror creatures of movie lore make a gory appearance. This ambitious conceit would be the main bone of contention of those who like and dislike this complicated film: do you buy Whedon's wild theory or not? I certainly liked it and I'm buying it.",The Cabin in the Woods
2208,80,TdSmth5,Genius,9/10,23 September 2012,"The Cabin in the Woods is just the kind of horror movie that has been sorely missing for years. The horror genre tends to play it too safe. There's the slasher era, the torture porn era, and now we're suffering through the awful lost footage era, unfortunately the zombie TV fad never really made it to the movies. Horror and comedy has often been combined and the result has usually been embarrassing. This movie has a bit of comedy and zombies and just breaks through these subgenres to create something fresh and unique. I've been waiting for a movie like this, a movie in the spirit of The Return of the Living Dead, a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but respects the audience.We initially meet some 60s style scientists in some large facility who are taking part in some sort of international contest, the only contenders left are the US and Japan.Suddenly we switch to a group of horror-movie-stereotypical kids. The guy who goes everywhere with a football, the guy who goes everywhere with a bong, the slutty blonde, the pure girl, and the nerdy guy. They're going for a road trip to a cabin in the woods. On the way they meet the stereotypical backward gas station attendant who warns them. Once they get there it all seems nice and fun enough until they go to the cellar, find all sorts of creepy objects among them a book and start reading incantations in Latin from it. Then one of the scientist in control pulls a lever to release the Buckner family- a family of zombies. The zombies go after and kill some of the kids in gruesome ways.When only the virgin is thought to be left, the entire staff at the science project celebrates their victory over Japan. We also get hints of what is behind all this. But it turns out the celebration was premature. The remaining kids not only escape the Buckner family but also make it into the science facility and what they've find there is just wild.The Cabin in the Woods successfully combines plenty of elements/references from other horror movies into something new and unexpected. It succeeds in all its different aspects. The horror element is very well done, with the truly scary zombie family. And these zombies look and act the way zombies should. They don't look like people with some pasty mascara on and don't run around like toddlers on a sugar high. The look more like 80s Italian zombies, the best kind. Skinny, rotten. Well except for a big rotten zombie. The funny bits are truly funny, and our dopey guy gets the funny lines and he sure delivers them well. Acting all around is excellent. Then there is a crazy fantasy aspect to the movie as well as a more serious mythology to it that is interesting. And of course the scientists add a bit of deception and conspiracy. While a sequel would be difficult to make, I sure wouldn't mind some prequels.",The Cabin in the Woods
2209,81,drystyx,Better to die like a soldier than live like a coolie,9/10,18 November 2015,"Whedon and Goddard changed my mind about all Hollywood writers being hacks. These two knew their craft.There is much to this film, and one has to stick it out, because it begins with as big a cliché of horror as one can get, and that's intentional because of the story here, which is actually many symbolic stories rolled into one.I probably wouldn't have continued watching had I not intended to critique it, and that's why I'm not a fan of modern story telling. In order to be produced, one must do as these two writers do, ""unfold"" the story. I don't like being manipulated, and Christianity dictates not to ""manipulate"", and that's why this story is as Christian as one can get, albeit a more Gnostic Christian story than usual. It shows up ""manipulation"".How to tell of this film without spoilers? I think some things need to be said. But I won't reveal any ""real spoiler"", other than a lot of what you see that you think is off subject, is actually right on target.There are allusions here to many films, but mostly to THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The evil Japanese commander in that film states:BETTER TO DIE LIKE A SOLDIER THAN LIVE LIKE A COOLIEAnd our five young people do that. They encounter danger, and of course the first fatality has no idea of the danger, just as if five people walk through their football field, and suddenly one steps on a mine. The first one can have no clue as to the reality, and so the others learn more and more as they go along.Remember that quote from KWAI. It has meaning. Because the surface of the story is about five young people who are the usual five who enter the horror story, so much so that we can almost sense the writing team has something else in mind, if they're truly writers, and they don't disappoint us.I don't give this a 10/10 yet, because before I give a film that, it must digest and pass a test of time with me.This film will be relevant as long as we have IMDb bubble boys, and those are the ones who are put down most by this film.The film is ""anti-horror"" instead of ""horror"".There are many levels of symbolism here. For example, there is an ""army symbolism"" here. The five young people are ""sacrificed"" in a way by the ""officer characters"".And the writers are careful to show that of the main ""office"" characters relegating the action, only two are ""officers"" who have the ideology of the Hellish game, while the others are symbolic of the squadron clerks, maintenance, mechanics, the support people doing their job. One girl, maybe the closest of the ""enlisted"" to the ""officers"" even states that while the officer characters are ""celebrating"", she is ""drinking"". That line, among others, has more significance than the casual observer might realize.The ""sacrifice"" angle is shown for what it is, too. We see the officer characters demanding to be in complete control, even of the order of fatalities.And the five young people do their best. They are given labels of ""nerd"", ""virgin"" and other labels, labels which for one of them proves to be the ultimate irony.We see other cultures playing the same control game with young people, but not to the degree the Americans do. Again, there is more being stated here than meets the eye. The modern American, in a worship of evil, in considering cannibals immortal, serial killers undying, homicidal maniacs gifted, the bubble boy horror fan who worships this idea, is the exact opposite of the American revolutionaries Patrick Henry and Thomas Payne. The exact opposite.Back in the 1960s I remember kids playing make believe, and there would always be the older control freak kid who made each invisible door release an even bigger demon to defeat, just to torment the other kids. And I've no doubt that there were such control freaks in 1960 B.C. doing the same.According to the film, people have been subjecting themselves to this for ages. And it became a religion to those who have the worst outlook on good and evil. ""Fair is foul and Foul is Fair"", except these maniacs take it to mean spiritual ""fair and foul"" being the opposite.A lot of this is explored. And pay attention to the Japanese girls. Because there is more symbolism here. They represent the total opposite of what the American ideology is. Again, I refer to the quote in the classic war film given above.In the end, I won't say if it's some of the original five young people, or some of the other characters, but two of them are given the choice to continue playing the game, and they fall for it for a while, because they believe the lies that it will save humanity, when in fact, all it does is keep humanity in slavery.I hope I haven't ""spoiled"" anything. I would rather a first time viewer just keep an open mind throughout, and wait till the end.",The Cabin in the Woods
2210,82,aidanratesmovies,"Not Great, but a Fun filled Horror movie that makes the best of its absurd premise",9/10,8 February 2020,"Although the film may not hold together as much as it thinks it does, Cabin in the Woods is a smart enough twist on the horror genre to provide some genuinely good scares and fun thrills. The film does drag for about the first third, but once the plot begins to move and we move past the cliche setup is when things decide to get interesting. What provides for the next to acts of the film, is something not like any films before it, which is not only a great lesson for horror movies in general, but films as well, in order to prove their material less lacking. Cabin in the Woods, for the most part, makes the most out of its absurd although interesting premise. The performances are nothing too special here, but the standouts are, by far, film veterans Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins. The script for the most part, is well written, and the cinematography is not too outlandish, but interesting enough to provide some thought. In the end, The Cabin in the Woods is not a great horror movie. But a fun filled twist on the genre, that makes better use of its premise than films attempting to do similar works, like Scream.
My Rating: 8.5/10",The Cabin in the Woods
2211,83,ferbs54,An Over-The-Top Thrill Ride With Too Few Explanations,8/10,19 June 2020,"When ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was released in April 2012, it almost immediately became something of a sensation, a hit both with the critics and the public, ultimately going on to gross around $67 million at the box office, after having been produced for $30 million. Despite all that, however, and despite the fact that I am an old fan of a good horror movie, well told, I managed to miss the film when it was first run, and only caught up with it very recently, at home. And now, I am most regretful that I did not run to the theaters back when, as this really is a film that would have benefited from being seen on the big screen. It is an eye-popping film, loaded with suspense, action, scares, laughs, and amazing special FX; one that would have been ideal for seeing with a good audience. Not since 1996's ""Scream,"" perhaps, has a motion picture so knowingly and winkingly toyed with the conventions of the horror film, and to such winning effect, all the while adding something fresh and new to the conversation. As I say, a perfect film for watching with others in a theater, and yet, so good is the film, that even at home it managed to stun and leave this viewer slack jawed, although not entirely satisfied. More on this in a moment.The film is one that will undoubtedly leave the viewer feeling more and more puzzled as he/she watches. It opens inside what looks to be a highly advanced and scientific installation of some sort, where we see two men, Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford), casually joking around while making small talk about how the Swedes have just botched their end of the operation, leaving only the U.S. and Japan in the game. What ARE they talking about? We jump to five attractive college kids who are about to go off for a long weekend in the country. These students are athletic Curt (Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, who had just started playing the role of Thor for Marvel Studios one year earlier), his blonde hottie girlfriend Jules (New Zealander actress Anna Hutchison), the bookish but buff Holden (Jesse Williams), stoner dude Marty (Fran Kranz), and sweet Dana (Kristen Connolly, who many will recognize from television's ""House of Cards"" and ""Zoo""). The five are horror-film archetypes - the athlete, the slutty girl, the scholar, the fool and the virgin, although Dana is admittedly hardly the latter, strangely enough - and before long, we are made witness to any number of other horror film conventions. They encounter a creepy gas station attendant en route to the cabin of Curt's cousin, where they will be staying, while the viewer is made increasingly aware that things just aren't right here. The men in that scientific installation are keeping constant watch on the five, and, even more startling, a bird that flies high over the quintet's van en route to their destination suddenly hits a force field of some kind and is puffed out of existence! Once at the cabin, a party gets started, while we see Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the proceedings from afar, changing the outside ambient air temperature, altering the moonlight (!), even allowing puffs of pheromone vapor to arise from the ground to increase Jules' already primed libido. But matters really start to take off around the film's 30-minute mark, when zombies arise from the earth, in response to some Latin words uttered by Dana from a creepy old diary that she had found in the cabin's cellar. These zombies proceed to butcher several of the teens in a most ghastly manner during the film's central third section, while another is killed during an escape attempt. Finally, in the film's most flabbergasting sequence, the final half hour, the two students who are left (don't ask me which ones, please) manage to discover the secret of just what the hell is going on as they penetrate that mysterious scientific facility, leading to monstrous mayhem the likes of which you have rarely seen on screen....""The Cabin in the Woods"" is the type of film that grows increasingly wacky and more amazing as it proceeds, and indeed, its final half hour really is one for the books, mixing in as it does not just those hideous zombies, but also (take a deep breath) a hideous werewolf, a skull-faced wraith, a girl in a tutu whose face is a gaping cavity of fangs, a dude who might just be Pinhead's cousin from ""Hellraiser"" (1987), giant snakes straight out of the pages of Robert E. Howard, winged creatures that beggar my poor powers of description, macabre doll people, a killer clown, monstrosities that spout green blood, a homicidal unicorn, a lumbering whatsit that tears its victims apart while spouting their blood out of its blowhole, and more ... so many more. This monster mash in that scientific installation throws so very much at the viewer that it will be a sequence you will want to rewind and rewatch over and over again. And indeed, the entire film is one for which you might find the need to experience again immediately after your first viewing. During that first watch, while you are attempting to figure out what is transpiring, and why these scientists are doing what they're doing, you'll just barely hang on and go along for the ride. A second viewing will allow you to better appreciate how all the pieces kinda sorta fit together and make some kind of sense. And I say ""kinda sorta"" only because, unfortunately, the film hardly gives away all its secrets, and that is a pity.""The Cabin in the Woods"" has been directed in a very impressive and stylish manner by Drew Goddard, a former writer on television's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Alias"" and ""Lost,"" as well as the films ""Cloverfield"" (2007), ""World War Z"" (2013) and ""The Martian"" (2015). As with ""Lost"" and ""Cloverfield,"" the film astonishes the viewer with its mysterious incidents and set pieces but ultimately fails to answer all our legitimate questions. Goddard, who wrote the film along with Joss Whedon (another ""Buffy"" screenwriter, as well as the screenwriter for ""Toy Story"" and the director of two Avengers films), seems to delight in stunning the viewer while withholding all but the sketchiest of rationales as an explanation. Here, that explanation comes from The Director (played by a surprise guest star whose name I should perhaps not reveal, although he/she remains a horror and sci-fi favorite), who fails to explain how these scientists have been operating in secrecy for so long, how these monstrous creatures have come about, why their, er, higher-ups insist on these proceedings, and many other bothersome questions. Thus, this is a film that works best as long as you don't think about it too deeply, but rather, just go along for the undeniable thrill ride that it is. And in truth, the film is well acted by all concerned, and is gripping and altogether dumbfounding. It is also extremely gory and violent, with a very high body count ... actually, with what I should call a practically universal body count, as things turn out. It is thus decidedly not recommended for the squeamish viewer or those who are averse to the red stuff. The film, as mentioned, also contains much in the way of humor, both as far as amusing one-liners are concerned and in the sly acknowledgment of those hallowed horror conventions; thus, the five student archetypes, that gas station dude who serves as a sinister portent, the pot- and booze-fueled party in the cabin, the Latin reading and the rising of the zombies, the clever nods to the Japanese J-horror films of the early 2000s, etc. Interestingly, it is Marty here, the perpetually zonked stoner dude, who is the first to perceive a glimmering of what is going on, and who turns out to be something of a hero by the film's end. And the sight of him fighting off those zombies with a drinking cup that instantly transforms into an oversized bong certainly is one to cheer.When ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was initially released, its promotional poster sported the tagline ""You Think You Know The Story."" It is a clever come-on, indeed, referring both to the fact that the film subverts and has fun with its horror film tropes, and the fact that the film does indeed pull the rug out from under the viewer's expectations. It is a difficult film to write about without giving away any of the picture's manifold secrets, and so I am currently trying to be coy here as I skip around the central conceit and attempt not to reveal any spoilers. Let's just say that this is a film that has never even been considered for a sequel, despite its huge success, and I for one could not even imagine how a sequel would be possible, after the ending that we are given. One and done, but what a ""one"" this film is! You might walk away from the film scratching your head, but you are surely not likely to forget it....",The Cabin in the Woods
2212,84,aharmas,The Ultimate Treat,10/10,24 April 2012,"One of the best compliments a horror picture can get is that the suspense worked, and it was really spooky. It has been ages since this has happened in a film like this, ""Cabin in The Woods"" goes a step further than some of the classics, whether it follows a straightforward narrative or it approaches its main themes in an innovative way. This film will probably end up pleasing most of those who see it because it has a lot to offer to just about any member of the audience.It all starts in the expected way, with five college students spending some vacation time in an isolated location, doing every little thing that can get them in trouble, and most of the plot for the first half of the film follows the expected pattern, with an interesting subplot slowly developing in the background. Soon, ""Cabin"" begins to show how impressive it is.What makes the film so good is that it keeps surprising you, even when you think you have figured its angles. Stereotypes soon turn into something else, minor characters begin to resonate in unexpected ways, and the jolts are genuine, as we see them in a refreshing perspective. It'd be cruel to reveal some of the developments in the last third of the film, but here is where most of the fun is.The audience is in for a treat as myths are revisited, some story lines are spun in, well, cool ways, and there is even a special appearance by a beloved figure near the end of the film. In the end, be prepared to relish a visual feast, with many a chance to enjoy a good scare, a good laugh, and to appreciate that as long as people have imagination, we will be pleasantly surprised.",The Cabin in the Woods
2213,85,TheOneThatYouWanted,Smart and Original Horror,9/10,3 July 2016,"This is the perfect horror film. It has gore, horror, action, comedy and an actual plot that is very clever. It is about a flock of teens going to a cabin in the woods but something isn't right, as you see from the backdrop. The best thing about this film is how it keeps escalating. I mean, it delivers and builds up to more and then delivers and the builds up to more yet again. And ultimately it climaxes into total insanity. It reminds me of the original Scream in how it breaks all the rules and uses that as part of the movie. I watched this film literally a few hours ago. That was my second time viewing the film because I was lucky enough to first see it when it came out back in 2012. And I'm sure I'll be seeing it a few more times and loving it more and more with each viewing, but there just isn't anything like experiencing this film for the first time and doing so without knowing anything about it. I'm going to end this review by just saying one word. Merman.

2214,86,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Excellent Meta Horror Film,10/10,4 April 2019,"This is an interesting film that takes a very meta look at the horror genre, while being a horror film on its own as well. This is one that I took home from Family Video and hated it. I did watch it with an ex and that probably effected me. Since then I've seen this a handful of times. I've come up from that first viewing by quite a bit. The synopsis is five friends go for a break at a remote cabin, where they get more than they bargained for, discovering the truth behind the cabin in the woods.This film I found to be quite amazing. There was a great blend of horror and comedy in this one. It develops two different types of things going on. We get two guys that are going to work in a concrete building, similar to that of a power plant-esque. Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford) have such great banter back and forth it. It definitely makes me feel like something I would do with guys I work with.Then on the other side, we have a group of college kids that are going on a vacation for the weekend at Curt's (Chris Hemsworth) cousin's new cabin. Coming with them is his girlfriend Jules (Anna Hutchison). Her best friend Dana (Kristen Connolly) is fresh out a relationship with one of her professors. They are being joined by Marty (Fran Kanz), who is a pothead, and Holden (Jesse Williams), who is quite smart and also a football player.On there why they encounter a creepy guy who runs a gas station, played by Tim DeZarn, who warns them about what they're going. The interesting thing though is that we learn the men in the inside of the building are controlling what is happening. They direct the teens to do certain things and which influence what comes after them. There is a reason for this, which I absolutely love. It is definitely Lovecraftian.I'm trying to go a little bit vague here as I don't want to spoil anything. I've probably given more than I should of, but that gives the jist. Something I wanted to bring up, which I can't full credit is a way to look at this. The process of running this can be looked at like we, the viewing audience, are like what the sacrifices are for. The studios and those making the films could be the men running the experiment and the movie is what is happening to our college kids. I found this theory to be quite interesting. The other way is just that we have horror fans making a horror film for us fans for sure.The editing of the film is great for me. It blends these two different stories seamlessly together. Once the two collide, it gets even crazier. The film is constantly building tension to the climax, which I love. I also was a big fan of the ending and I thought it was great. It really brings a moral dilemma to figure out what you'd do if you were in their place, face with this decision.Acting for this film is something else that is great. I really enjoyed Connolly as the 'virgin'. I thought she brings an interesting combination of fear and strength. She comes into her own and I like the character arch. Hemsworth, Hutchison, Kranz and Williams are all good as well. What I really like is that it establishes who they are, but in the cabin they become the stereotypes we know from horror films. It is amazing to do this. Jenkins and Whitford were really good as well. They play it so well that they have mundane jobs, but the fate of the world rests on them. I thought the rest of the cast round this film out well.The effects for this film are an interesting blend of CGI and practical. I thought the zombie redneck family that attacks the cabin was great. They looked amazing, in how they walked and looked. There are a few scenes with CGI that actually looked great as well. I thought they put a lot of attention and detail. I had no issues there. There is a bit of it that doesn't hold up, especially after this last viewing. There isn't any other way to do it though, I will say that. The blood and gore looked great. This is definitely strong in the film.I would recommend seeing this film. It definitely is different, but I found it to be one of the best horror films I've seen in awhile. If you don't like comedy blended in with your horror, you might not like this one then. I think it has a definitely deep story that looks at not only us the viewer, but how we see the films we love. In the story, it blends the two different worlds together. It also has a great Lovecraftian feel. The editing definitely keeps the film moving to the climax and the ending, which are both great. I thought the acting is solid across the board. The effects, both practical and CGI are also great. The soundtrack didn't stand out, but it definitely fit for what it needed. I would say give this one a viewing if this sounds interesting, because I don't think you'll be disappointed. I think this is an amazing film.Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",The Cabin in the Woods
2215,87,lastliberal-853-253708,Let's .get this party started.,7/10,19 July 2013,"Now, what do you think you will find in a cabin in the woods. It's just like those idiots that get off the highway and take the back roads. Either way, you'll get what you deserve.I couldn't figure why there would be three guys and two girls going to the cabin, but I guess the stoner is only interested in one thing.Zombies! It has zombies. Yeah.But, Drew Goddard (writer and director) and Joss Whedon (writer) have surprises in store for us. Technology geeks (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) are part of a whole crew that is behind the scenes manipulating what is going on in the woods. Why? A reality show? Some weird science experiment? It's a cinch that this is not your daddy's zombie in the woods flick.Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz make this film work, especially at the end, which we totally did not see coming.",The Cabin in the Woods
2216,88,jadepietro,Monster Mash-Up,4/10,17 April 2012,"This film is not recommended.You've heard the one about the jock, the hottie, the intellectual, the stoner, and the virgin who decided to go have some fun at a remote cabin in the woods. Five go in, and...Well, you've certainly seen variations on this horror theme before, including Friday the 13th, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few examples from this overworked genre. Let's face it, whenever nubile teenagers go for a quiet getaway in the deep dark woods, there's got to be danger a mere step or two away. After all, it's not called the WILDerness without good reason. Now I do enjoy the synthetic scare of sitting in a darken theater and jumping in synchronized midair movement along with my fellow moviegoers, as long as the film follows these three basic rules of suspense: Rule No. 1. It builds suspense. ( Usually this is the case in many films, an easy accomplishment with sound effects, sudden staccato music shifts, and darkness all around. ) Rule No. 2. It stays logical until the end. ( Rarely does the end achieve that goal since its beginning phase sets up the heightened tension and higher expectations only to disappoint by the film's gruesome finale. ) Rule No. 3. It doesn't glorify gratuitous gore for violence's sake ( Never happens nowadays, especially if the filmmakers want to see any possible profit ). So, I decided to kill some time and went to see what I thought would be another predictable slasher movie, with perhaps a bit more wit and spine-tingling tension, since it was penned by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame. Well, the film wasn't so much predictable as it was forgettable.Yes,I can now report that The Cabin in the Woods doesn't meet many of those criteria. ( In fact, it only manages to register with the first rule of horror films. ) But the film is still a noble, if disappointing, effort to expand the realm of this genre. It is a spirited diversion and when it stays within its own terror-filled perimeter of the horror school of filmmaking, the film stays effective. Too often, the filmmakers continually undercut the elements of suspense by relying too much on the contrasting images of sci-fi technology.Co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, The Cabin in the Woods brings together the collective teenagers as the typical sacrificial lambs. The lambs for the slaughter are played by Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, and a younger Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth, all who have since achieved some fame in television and motion picture projects. ( The film, made in 2008, has been held up for release due to MGM's bankruptcy issues and has finally made it to the big screen after much delay. ) Also in the film are Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, both fine accomplished actors who may bring some stature to the film, but essentially are wasting their talents here. The multi-purpose script shows no real purpose at all. The screenplay tries its darnedest to be hip and innovative in its approach to elevate the horror genre with some comedic moments and action segments. The Cabin in the Woods contains many plot twists and turns ( too many ) which will be more effective for your filmgoing experience with less prior knowledge about the film and its tiered structure. So you'll hear no spoilers from this reviewer except to saw that I was more shocked by the film's positive reviews by the critics that from the antics on display.As the film rambles to its forgone conclusion, Whedon and Goddard throw every possible horror cliché at their movie-going audience, making the film becomes more laughable than scary, particularly with an uncredited cameo that makes the whole enterprise seem even more absurd. The Cabin in the Woods wants to be seen as a clever send-up to all the horror films past, a cagey deconstruction of the splatter film brand of filmmaking. But due to its multi-layering of convoluted plot devices and an uncanny knack for pop culture insights, it just doesn't work. When doing a mash-up of horror and sci-fi staples, both styles of film suffer under their own weight and individual identity. The Cabin in the Woods becomes a bit of a bi-polar mess, a sad little parody of itself. Unfortunately, the joke is on the moviegoers who become the sacrificial lambs that pay full dollar to see this kind of anticlimactic junk. GRADE: CNOTE: The movie poster shows off the gamesmanship and mystery that are an essential part to the film's success. With a side wink to the Rubik Cube phenomenon and a deep appreciation of the work of M.C. Escher, this marketing conceptually targets the right film audience and becomes intriguing art as well. The poster far exceeds the movie's overall effect. Checkmate!NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",The Cabin in the Woods
2217,89,onepotato2,A 4 star Groaner,1/10,22 April 2012,"This got such uniform good reviews, I knew I had to see it fast, before the buzz turned it into an over-hyped beast. No such luck. It IS an over-hyped beast. I should have known better. All the reviews I skimmed suggested a boffo trick ending or reveal... and I hate those movies. The script is not clever. If I had walked out as I was inclined in the middle of the tiresome set-up, I'd have missed nothing.The plot of this stinker involves slowly disclosing several nested narrative devices, and invokes higher and higher scales of society, until you know the ending will just HAVE to be the piece of full-scale idiocy that they came up with. But the writers offer not not a peep of explanation for why the sacrifice has to take the form of a clichéd, glacially slow, horror movie; which makes the movie convoluted, and the entire premise quite costly. Couldn't you just kill the 5 types in their homes, or better still in a way that introduce a new type of horror movie? But no, the writers paint themselves into a corner, thinking (as TV talent does) that sensation is even better than thought, and will save this overextended premise in the end. There has never been a movie that builds to a CGI monster that is worth a damn. The movie got some kudos for its references to previous movies (The Shining, Alien 3, The Ring), but it's also so dumb it just lazily rips most of them off: The Truman Show, And then there were None, Army of Darkness, Halloween 3, Cube, 13 ghosts, Rosemary's Baby, Hellraiser, etc. No matter how you mash 20 old movies together, it will not produce ""new.The movie poster (a house exterior turned into a rubik's cube) rips off the poster for Deathtrap; another bit of drivel - with a terrible, terrible twist ending - that received scads of undeserved rave reviews. If you've exhausted yourself today sitting at home watching vapid TV, and you need a break, Cabin in the Woods will take your tired thoughtless mind even dumber places. But there is zero purpose in seeing it. This movie will be forgotten in 5 years (see also: Identity).",The Cabin in the Woods
2218,0,CinemaSerf,A man who found Christ - but on his own terms...,7/10,15 November 2021,"Delivered by way of an over-arching monologue, Max McLean, Nicholas Ralph and Eddie Ray Martin take us on a well written and delivered exploration of this author as he grows up and evolves from a hardened man of no faith through his gradual acceptance of the premiss of deism, then ultimately of the Christian faith. McLean is on great form delivering the narrative - and it is full of allegory, humour - even a little bit of lust! We hear of how this young man and his brother grew up in a home with his Welsh father and, after the tragic death of his mother to cancer when both were young, of his education and his WWI experiences before returning to academia at Oxford where he engaged in heated, though always enjoyable, debates with the likes of Barwell and Tolkien. The occasional use of action scenes, especially involving Ralph, oxygenate the script. They allow us to take a breather from the barrage of words that do require our concentration - his use of language is complex yet entertaining and not in the least abstruse. It was also great to see this in a full cinema - a testament to this fellow who wrote some of the most wonderful of escapist literature.",The Most Reluctant Convert
2219,1,joeyford-55342,"got a sneek peak, amazing",10/10,4 November 2021,"This movie will take the world by storm if it gets out. Christian movies usually don't get much play. Passion of Christ showed that to be a big mistake. If churches come out it will succeed. C. S. Lewis was an atheist at the start of his journey. I had no idea. I read the Closet series and loved it as a kid. It influenced my life. His discussions with other brilliant minds of the time both Christian and not are legendary. Great movie and great man!

2220,2,dan_slentz,Interesting Production... But S-L-O-W Story!!,3/10,21 November 2021,"I see many movies and I try to rate them fairly and honestly. I've helped with the making of movies, so I know the incredible effort put in by everyone involved, so giving a movie a low rating is painful.Production values are good, but for a period piece, the budge apparently didn't allow attention to detail (like Yale locks on doors that were modern.. and even a non-existent lock that the foley artist added a click and keys to (though the actor had no keys in his hand and the door clearly had the deadbolt lock removed. When the details become apparent and obvious.. taking the viewer out of the story, it's a problem.The style of production was interesting, and the crew deserves a lot of credit for putting together an well edited piece, but the most important aspect of ANY store IS the story. And this just dragged on and on. It's extremely rare that I ever doze off during a moving, but this one did it to me! After an hour of watching this, I finally gave up and paid to see something else.The trouble with IMDB ratings is I often wonder if the reviews are done by production crew, family, friends, and relatives to falsely raise the number. This is showing a 7 star rating as I write this.. and there is simply NO WAY the rating isn't being skewed by bogus reviews. It's NOT ""the greatest thing ever"".. nor ""inspirational and astounding"". It's a very dry story telling of a kid who gave up on God, then found God, then became a successful writer. It was apparently produced by a religious company who sat on a slide announcing who their founder is and their address for the first 30 seconds to minute of the movie.. then 15 minutes telling us how they made the movie (before the movie ever starts).Nope. Not worth watching.. not a great nor inspirational movie (though some movies like the kid who fell through ice or the musician who would die of cancer positively were beautifully told, this movie is NOT interesting or entertaining).",The Most Reluctant Convert
2221,3,catwantsin,Honesty and Inspiration that Astound!,10/10,8 November 2021,"THE MOST RELUCTANT CONVERT - 2021Tagline: The Untold Story Of C. S. LewisNote - This movie wasn't given an MPAA rating, but it is definitely suitable for all audiences.This is the dramatic retelling of the true story of C. S. Lewis from his youth to his unlikely conversion to Christianity. It covers his traumatic childhood facing his mother's death at an earlier age, his distant father, his experience in The Great War, his friendship with J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson and more.First off this movie just covers a ton of stuff I never knew about C. S. Lewis and its 93 minute running time left me wanting to find out more. I mean millions have read and been both moved and entertained by C. S. Lewis who is essentially a crossover legend for both Christian and secular fans of fantasy and theology. His books are both wildly entertaining and challenging without exception. So to see something like this that deals completely with his early life and really doesn't broach his writing excellence at all was pretty fascinating.If you read my reviews a lot you know I don't just go running to bibliographies with open arms. I actually run from them a lot like C. S. Lewis did the concept of anything outside the material world. I for one am fairly skeptical of most ""faith based"" films. Sadly the production and quality acting in one is about like trying to find a real needle in a stack of fake ones. I wish this wasn't the case because the messages are almost always mind-blowing or at the very least inspiring. This is not to say there are not a handful of newer productions and even some older ones that seem to fly well above the production subfloor. This is one of those films.I loved how this thing was put together and the storytelling method was extremely engaging. It was almost like having C. S. Lewis telling you all this and you are standing right there with him in the movie. Max McLean plays the elder version of C. S. Lewis like someone who has been in Hollywood for decades. His performance is superb and unforgettable. Turns out he has only done a small batch of faith based films, but wow. I would love to see more of McLean's productions. Just his acting alone is worth seeing this movie, but the width and breadth of the script is rich and thought provoking in regards to value, purpose, and pondering your own place in the universe as anything you will see on screen in the next decade or more. I also really liked Nicholas Ralph as kind of the ""college age"" C. S. Lewis, but he wasn't as funny as the elder C. S. Lewis who did all the narration, often along-side the other versions of himself, but never interacting. Eddie Ray Martin is also very solid as the younger C. S. Lewis in the film. Tom Glenister is brilliant as J. R. R. Tolkien and gets more screen time than David Shields who played Hugo Dyson. David Shields has been acting for a while and was even in an episode of ""Doctor Who"". I should also note that Amy Alexander (who plays C. S. Lewis's mom) stands out in this but her time on screen is extremely brief.Execution wise and in regards to the pacing, this movie is near perfect. I really didn't feel there were any lulls and the injections of humor at just the right time helped lighten up some of the struggles we see Lewis face in this film. If you have never seen the stage play, all I can say is expect the unexpected. I can't say enough how much I love this thing and how it brought out the very real challenges of meticulously and fervently combating the obvious truth of Jesus Christ and the ultimate acceptance that the I AM is the I AM.My only critique of this thing is that I wanted a longer movie. I really just wanted to know more. Actually I do have a second thing to point out, we also get a bit of a ""making of"" this movie before the movie. I felt that was oddly placed. If you want to tell us how you made it and what went into it, do that afterwards. I can't wait to get the DVD or BLU RAY of this thing. It's something I see myself watching often.Overall this is a very powerful film aimed at everyone. It is full of inspiration and honesty and I can't give it anything less than a 10 out of 10.",The Most Reluctant Convert

2223,5,jllyrk,Very well done but still has so much potential,8/10,15 November 2021,"I am a fan of CS Lewis and of the Fellowship for Performing Arts. I have seen The Most Reluctant Convert on stage. It is an excellent stage play. The movie version is faithful to the stage production. But when utilizing a visual medium, I think the script could have been augmented to be less monologue and have more of an emotional connection through the interaction of the actors. I believe the other actors are probably excellent and I would love to have seen more. But otherwise the production quality was very high and Max McLean did a beautiful job reflecting CS Lewis' spiritual journey.

2225,7,ragmuffn,An Enjoyable Evening with a Mentor and Friend,10/10,23 November 2021,"C. S. Lewis has been a significant influence in my own spiritual formation. As someone who shared a childhood akin to his which left me hating God, I was also a hard sell on Christianity. Lewis' writings gave me the freedom to ask hard questions - and how to search properly for the answers, think in unique ways and chase after non-fiction written with spice, imagination and thoroughness. Having said all this, walking with Lewis on his journey in this film was a gift. The cast's stellar performance, the rhythm of his recollections, traveling in the actual locations - it was a gift beyond hoping for.

Quite funny in many places. Stunning cinematography of Oxford especially.

2228,10,erinjkahn-15027,"An engaging, beautiful film about my favorite author",8/10,19 November 2021,"As CS Lewis' biggest fan I think my opinion counts for something, and I absolutely loved this movie. I've also seen the play it's based on (twice) and thought the filmmakers did a wonderful job transforming it for the screen. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is great, and everything is very faithful to Lewis and his world. It was fun seeing Tolkien and The Great Knock portrayed on film, and I loved seeing Oxford and the Kilns. If you're a fan of Lewis' fiction but don't know much about his personal life, this is a fantastic introduction; and if you've read Surprised By Joy twice (which I have), you'll still find it delightfully surprising and informative. My only criticism is that I would have liked a little more dramatization instead of so much monologuing, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was an incredibly well-made film. It feels like an intimate conversation with Jack himself, and Max McLean brings him to life so beautifully, what's not to love?

2231,13,sharonjjones-40274,Belfast viewing,10/10,20 November 2021,"Beautifully shot, largely in Oxford, the film opens up C. S. Lewis's spiritual journey from atheism, to theism, and ultimately to faith in Christ. Cambridge also played an important role in Lewis's life, but given that the focus in this film is his conversion, Oxford takes centre stage. McLean's energetic and sustained performance as Lewis is lucid, engaging and warm. He brings to life the great writer's sharp sense of humour, as well as the depth of his thinking. In bringing us closer to Lewis's inner world, the film as a whole does not disappoint. His is a story that lifts hearts and minds from the vicissitudes and darkness of our contemporary world. Under the shadow of conflict and personal loss, as the film recalls, Lewis's own day was troubled too. But his spiritual biography directs our attention to 'news from a country we have never yet visited'. Good news. It is important for us that this story is told, not only in London and Oxford and Cambridge and New York, but here in Belfast, the city of Lewis's birth. It is a homecoming that we treasure.

2233,15,mattjl-14353,Absolute brilliance,10/10,24 November 2021,"Absolutely brilliant movie about Lewis' eventual conversion to Christianity after which he wrote so many amazing books such as the Narnia series, Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity, The Great Divorce, A Grief Observed, and others. It was extremely true to him as a very intellectual and philosophical movie, it really felt like his writing Mere Christianity was coming to life by seeing how the way he wrote intellectually and apologetically was also the way he approached these theological questions from his time as an atheist and agnostic to eventual theist and Christian.Obviously if he's not a favorite author of yours or if you haven't read his work or aren't interested in theology and philosophy then this probably will go over your head or won't interest you. But for those that enjoy this, it's a master-piece.

2236,18,victor-161,Top notch cinematography and well put together,9/10,8 November 2021,"This feature movie is a top notch production, well acted, filmed and cut. The score accentuates scenes emotionally very well, without getting the front stage. The scenery is gorgeous, so there is a lot of visual appeal.The mood is a bit melancholic and the story telling breaks a few rules in an unexpected way. The main character strolls in and out of his own memories and in the beginning and the end of the movie, literally in and out of the movie set.Should you take your kids to it? Maybe. There is not much violence, although there war scenes. The word sex is mentioned a few times, but nothing more than that. I was more concerned with little ones being bored of the monologue, but unlike the one man stage play, the visuals keep the story very interesting, but still at slow pace.In conclusion.... I think the closing conclusion drawn by the main character brings the whole thing together very well, if not triumphant.Bravo!",The Most Reluctant Convert

This documentary is great both cinematically and educationally. The detail and effort put into this documentary is seen throughout the film.Julia is a new documentary about famous cook, author and television personality, Julia Child. It follows her through the struggles of being a woman in the film industry, her 12 year struggle to publish Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and her fight with breast cancer. This film talks about how Ms. Child changed the cooking industry, and America in general - forever.This film takes an extra deep dive into Child's life, going from where and when she was born all the way through her cooking career, up to her tragic death. It has great detail, exceptional archival footage and sound bites, which add to its interest. Some of the information about Julia are so fascinating that I really just had to learn more. She really was a hilarious person! Julia was such a character and that is what makes this film really fun to watch. My favorite part is when it talks about Child's love life, because I really love learning that Julia was such an independent woman. She didn't get married until she was 35! I thought that was really cool.The message of Julia is that dedication and hard work will help you achieve your goals. Julia had some struggles as a woman in the television industry, but with her hard work, she was able to overcome all of it. There are a few sexual references in this documentary and a very small bit of profanity to watch out for.I give Julia 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters November 19, 2021. By Kendall B., KIDS FIRST!",Julia
2239,1,gregorymannpress-74762,People wil leave cinema hungry! It provides an extra oomph!,7/10,5 November 2021,"""Julia""Julia was more than a cook. She was a cultural force. That summation of cooking and TV phenomenon Julia Child begins an exploration into how one of America's most unique television-era and literary figures jump-started a food revolution. ""Julia"" brings to life the legendary cookbook author and television superstar who changed the way Americans think about food, television, and even about women. Using never-before-seen archival footage, personal photos, first-person narratives, and cutting-edge, mouth-watering food cinematography, the film traces Julia Child from her well-to-do childhood in Pasadena, California, to the 'Far East' during 'World War II', where as an OSS worker she met her future husband Paul Child. One of the few women to attend Paris 'Le Cordon Bleu' school, Julia Child became a bestselling author in her 50s thanks to the seminal cookbook 'Mastering The Art Of French Cooking'.An appearance on Boston public television led to her mega-successful public TV show 'The French Chef', decades of celebrity, and a dedication to teaching Americans the joys of cooking. ""Julia"" is the story of a woman conquering the male-dominated food world, but it's also a feminist love story; Paul Child served as his wife's fiercest advocate and loudest cheerleader. ""Julia"" unwraps how one of the modern era's most entertaining and vibrant personalities sparked a re-evaluation of the culinary arts and a love of food in the United States as she seasoned her days with romance, curiosity, and a recipe for living life to the fullest. It's the empowering story of a woman who found her purpose, and her fame, at 50, and took America along on the whole delicious journey.The love of cooking is now central to American culture, with an appreciation for the artistry of preparing delicious cuisine filling 'Instagram' accounts, 'Twitter' feeds, airwaves, blogs, and bookshelves. It's a complete generational shift from the way Americans used to see food, which in the 'Mad Men' era of 60-plus years ago ran the gamut from blood-red meat and potatoes to unimaginative processed food. That's, until one woman changed American palettes; Julia Child brought continental recipes and an excitement about the experience of cooking to kitchens across the United States with her bestselling 1961 book 'Mastering The Art Of French Cooking', and then brought her playful and unique personality and her love of food into homes with her groundbreaking syndicated program 'The French Chef', which ran from 1963 to 1973. ""Julia"" shows how the standard at the time for local television programs was low-budget academic shows, with stiff and academic hosts seemingly. We're going to be comprehensive here and do a magnum opus of French cooking as it had never been done before. It was a big, serious book by a woman, an encyclopedia of food from another culture.The book meant a lot to people and symbolized something in the culture and especially to American women. And when she bursts onto the airwaves in the 1960s, it was a time people thought there was a certain way a woman on TV was supposed to be, they should have a quiet voice, be demure and petite, preferably blonde, certainly young, and either a sex bomb or a quote-unquote housewife type with every hair in place. Julia was the opposite of all of that, and it was because she became a television star by happenstance. She was a real human being with a great wacky personality, and it turns out, people really liked that. She brought a very French philosophy that food is sensual, and eating meals isn't a boring thing you have to do; it's one of the great pleasures of the world. That's a fairly new idea for a lot of Americans. We take it for granted now that we've all of these cooking shows, but before Julia, there wasn't much. She was unique as a personality in the '70s, and then in the '80s, as cable television took off and the 'Food Network' and other channels began to see people responding to cooking, the genre grew. It cut across generations to people who aspired to cook and who enjoyed watching other people cook. In 2004, Julia Child succumbed to kidney failure, passing away at the age of 91.When you think about the great food personalities on TV now, Julia's idea about cooking is very much a part of it. Food is not just a series of steps to prepare a meal. It's about making a festive, pleasurable experience for us all to share. The emotional impact of food is huge. When you're looking at food, it's as a combination of all the senses: The visual, how you're smelling different ingredients, the way they dissolve on your taste buds, the texture of it. When you're cooking, it's about anticipation and understanding how you're building the meal. Through the macro food photography, the film brings the audience up close and personal in order for them to see the steam, see the bubbles bursting in gravy, see mmmmmmmm slowed down, gives us inspiration. It's amazing how alive those food sections feel, partly because of the sound design. Something about seeing those dishes being made just bring to mind a delightful, rolling river.Written by Gregory Mann.",Julia
2240,0,MartinHafer,"Well, it's certainly no ""Give My Regards to Broad Street""...thank God!",6/10,15 June 2011,"In the 1980s, Paul McCartney made a film that was obviously inspired by ""A Hard Day's Night"". However similar in structure, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"" was clearly NOT the same quality movie. So, if you saw this much later film and assumed ""A Hard Day's Night"" is also a boring, bloated and enormously long-winded music video, think twice! Despite having practically no plot and TONS of Beatles songs strung together instead of a story, there is something likable about ""A Hard Day's Night"" and it gives you the next best thing to a backstage pass to meet them--albeit heavily scripted and plasticized.The plot, for what it is, is a visit to the hectic life of the Beatles--making it not much of a stretch for the boys. And they essentially play the public roles each played--Paul was the sweet and nice one, John the clever smart-aleck, George the quiet one and Ringo the goofy one. Whether this is exactly as they really were is pretty doubtful, but they did play the parts the public expected and loved. The film includes them being chased by fans (A LOT), riding trains, making eyes at girls, cracking jokes and singing. Along for the ride is the somewhat irrelevant 'grandfather' of Paul--who was actually actor Wilfrid Brambell from ""Steptoe and Son"" (a precursor to ""Sanford and Son"" in America). He mostly just sits there and looks serious or chases young women. In the MANY times when the film breaks into seemingly spontaneous music videos, he mostly sits there and looks bewildered. I am sure back in 1964, anyone in the theater older than, say, 35, looked pretty much the same way!! As I said, the plot is VERY thin and mostly it's just a chance to pretend to see the Beatles as they are in real life (sure) and hear a lot of their songs...LOTS. In fact, it seems like the songs often take the place of plot. Now this would suck if it was, say, the Bay City Rollers,The Ohio Express or The Starland Vocal Band. But, considering almost every song is among the group's best, it's hard to hate the lack of plot--unless you are a crazy young whippersnapper who hates the Fab Four! As for me, I found the film very forgettable but fun...with nice tunes. I did NOT see it as brilliant cinema and cannot understand all the votes of 10--which, to me, seem more like votes on how much they like the Beatles instead of the overall merits of a film. That's because it just didn't seem like a movie--more like an extended advertisement for the group in order to satisfy their insanely devoted fans and convert others to the cult! And, in that sense, it is a successful film---but oddness in style and the group not taking themselves too seriously don't, to me, make it a great film. Many of their jokes fall flat, the songs seem about as spontaneous as a moon landing and the lack of structure make it a niche film. A must-see? Well, if you love the Beatles, yes. Otherwise, just a strange and occasionally humorous 'anti-film' that tries hard NOT to be a movie.By the way, not matter how kooky the Beatles may or may not have been, who wears a hat and underwear in the bathtub, shaves a mirror or draws on TV monitors?! Also, watch Ringo when he plays the drums. Often his motions aren't even close to him really playing the drums and the sticks often don't come close to touching the drums!",A Hard Day's Night
2241,1,bkoganbing,"""It's Been A Hard Day's Night And I'm Working Like A Dog.""",8/10,2 February 2008,"I first saw this film way back in the day. Saw it, didn't hear or understand much of it, what with all those pubescent young females screaming their lungs out in the audience. When the young females were resting I had to contend with the Fab Four's Liverpudlian speech patterns which were as yet unfamiliar to me. Still very few soundtracks produced as many hits as did A Hard Day's Night.As much as The Beatles themselves revolutionized popular music, A Hard Day's Night also was a revolutionary film of its own. What you're seeing here is nothing less than the first music video, albeit a rather lengthy 90+ minute one.Director Richard Lester wisely eschewed the idea of a plot and basically did a docucomedy with songs about 12 hours in the life of John, Paul, George, and Ringo. They gave Paul a grandfather, played by Wilfred Brambell who when he wasn't getting into mischief on his own was influencing Ringo to spread his wings so to speak. Will Ringo get back to the studio in time for the big Broacast? Actually 32 years before that in Paramount's The Big Broadcast the same was asked of straying Bing Crosby. Of course you know the answer.A Hard Day's Night is must viewing for anyone who's trying to learn about the sixties.

I tend to like other contemporary artists better and in some cases I prefer the careers that McCartney and Lennon had after the group split. Therefore I wasn't particularly fussed about watching this drama-documentary-comedy-musical that follows the fab four around at the height of their fame. It's short in black and white with an on-street vibe by Musketeers director Richard Lester, but what comes across to me is just how unpleasant the group members are. They make constant wisecracks and jokes, but a lot of them seem to be sarcastic and mean-spirited, which I didn't find appealing at all. The songs are great and break up the rest of the tedium, and casting proper actors like Wilfrid Brambell in support was a great idea, but the rest is merely inconsequential - unless you're a fan who can't get enough of them.",A Hard Day's Night

They bring along Paul's grandfather as well as their various entourage on the trip as they have fun misadventures.This is simply fun and its success suggests the coming marriage of pop music and video imagery. The dry British humor is fun and it's all about the lads' charm. They sell the material better than any experienced actors. They seem to be really enjoying themselves. In that sense, director Richard Lester is lucky and he's also smart enough to let them go at it. And the music is so great. It is a pop icon of the 20th century.

2244,4,Hitchcoc,It Seems a Million Years Ago,10/10,17 March 2015,"I was a male teenager in the 1960's. To me and my friends, the Beatles and the British invasion was so important. We were normal kids with all kinds of other things going on, but whenever a new album came out we were there. There was so little footage of the guys because other than the news when they came to a new city, it was non-existent. Videotape was minimal. There was some film of their concerts but the screaming drowned out most of the music. When ""A Hard Day's Night"" came along it was gift. We had the ""Ed Sullivan Show"" and that was it, so to see all those songs being performed and hearing them talk and act. Fantastic. I couldn't afford to go to the one concert at the old Metropolitan Stadium (home of the Twins in Bloomington, MN) because we were a very poor family, but my friends told me they were unable to hear anyway. Still, it would have been a great experience. The wonderful thing about this film is that it is funny and intelligent and works so well. It is about the Beatles as it should be, and yet there is a surreal element that is so precious. So much has been written about Richard Lester and what he did, but he deserves it.

I was never a Beatles fan back in the day, I thought they'd be a passing fad and all the screaming girls at their concert appearances convinced me that too many people had simply lost their minds. So it's fifty years later and whenever an early Beatles tune comes on the radio it gets my feet pumping in time to the beat. My appreciation of the Fab Four has obviously grown over time, and their staying power in popular music seems likely to continue forever.I had some interesting observations while watching this flick the other night. For starters, their hair really wasn't all that long! Mop-top, yes, to be sure, but otherwise they looked to be exceptionally well groomed. Virtually every closeup of the boys looked like it could have been a cover on the next issue of Teen Beat or 16. The frantic double and triple timed speed-ups in the filming with the odd camera angles was an early precursor to shows like 'The Monkees' and set a new standard for portraying zany antics in movies.In as much as there really is no story to speak of, what most viewers should enjoy is a hearty helping of the group's early popular songs. If you're a fan you'll recognize them all and find yourself singing along. You get the impression the Beatles didn't take themselves too seriously at this stage in their careers, and it was a hoot to see a particular scene where an old man in a closet has a fan mag with a picture of Elvis on the cover.",A Hard Day's Night
2246,6,gavin6942,Beatlemania!,7/10,12 September 2014,"A 'typical' day in the life of the Beatles, including many of their famous songs.What is this film? Well, basically an album with footage between songs. If you want something with a good plot and characters, this may not be it. But if you like Beatles music and want to see some innovative film techniques, this is your movie.Bosley Crowther noted the film was a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likable young lads who are constantly amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing more than a little peace and quiet; however, they have to deal with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them.The film is credited as being one of the most influential musical films of all time, inspiring numerous spy films, the Monkees' television show and pop music videos. Having grown up in a world where MTV style is prevalent, the edits here may not be obvious to the current generation. But the Beatles and Monkees connection is clear -- indeed, the Monkees seem to have based their show almost entirely off this film.",A Hard Day's Night

Naturally, it wouldn't be a Beatles movie without their music. And the music always fits the scene (unlike so many musicals). My favorite scene was on the train where John, Paul, George and Ringo meet a middle-aged man, and...well, let's just say that it did a really funny job showing the generation gap. In short, you can always count on the Beatles to do something great, as every one of their songs showed. They may have had a ""hard"" time making this movie, but they would have to agree that it was worth it; people could easily spend ""days"" and ""nights"" watching it.

What makes this movie so special and enjoyable is the way it vividly captures the Fab Four when they were still pretty fresh, dynamic, and even fairly innocent; by having the Beatles wisely just be themselves this film manages to astutely nail the charming effervescent quality that made them stand out as a group. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all display a winningly natural rapport and a tight camaraderie that's a joy to behold. Moreover, they all deliver a slew of sharp snappy one-liners with cheeky aplomb. Wilfrid Brambell nearly steals the whole show as Paul's mischievous grandfather. In addition, there are amusing supporting contributions from Norman Rossington as long-suffering manager Norm, John Junkin as hapless lackey Shake, Victor Spinetti as a pompous TV director, and Kenneth Haigh as a pretentious advertising executive. Alun Owen's sly script pokes wickedly hilarious fun at everything from the media -- the press conference sequence is a riot! -- to television to the Beatles themselves. Directed with tremendous gusto by Richard Lester, exploding with infectiously anarchic energy, and further galvanized by a bunch of wonderful songs, there's a vibrancy and spontaneity evident throughout that's downright impossible to either dislike or resist. A total treat.",A Hard Day's Night
2250,10,ccthemovieman-1,"Plays Like An Early Music Video, But With Better Sound",6/10,30 September 2006,"This is a silly and stupid at many times but still almost something that could by now be a collector's item just to have so many of the early Beatles songs on one film. They permeate this movie and sound great in digital stereo, as opposed to how they first sounded on records when they were released decades ago. I say that just off hearing the VHS. I imagine the DVD with 5.1 surround sound makes this even that much better!The story is really nothing but showing the Beatles traveling to do a concert and quirky behind-the-scenes goings-on. This is a good period piece because of the dress, songs and British expressions of the day (i.e. ""Grotty,"" meaning ""grotesque."")This movie almost has the look of an early music video.

2251,11,ma-cortes,Joyous and fun romp dealing with a semi-documentary version of life on the road with the Fab Four,6/10,10 January 2019,"Here The Beatles in Their First Full Length, Hilarious Action-Packed Film . This is a very entertaining and funny romp with a sharp and ironic storyline by Owen and nice direction by Richard Lester , shooting without speed limit . A day and a half in the life of the Fab Four (Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr , George Harrison and John Lennon offering a few welcome moments of his acerbic , dry wit) leading up to a studio , in flight from the fanatic fans , managers (Norman Rossington) , and televised concert gig . It starts with the known rock and roll band travelling from their home town of Liverpool to London to perform in a television broadcast . While Paul's Grandpa (Wilfred Brambell) serving as a linking device to connect scenes of the Beatles. Ringo however is arrested and still isn't in the studio half an hour before air time. Soaring in their first, full-length, hilarious, action-packed film! 6 exciting new songs! Their first full length hilarious, action-packed film. The greatest rock & roll comedy adventure .The Fab Four's first movie is a joyous musical comedy through an ordinary ¨Day in the Life¨ of the Beatles, being their distinguished debut feature with an agreeable line in witty lunacy . Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style with great fair-play and noted as the first movie containing video-clips . Here the Beatles make like Max Sennett with a touch of Marx Brothers , including a paper-thin screenplay about difficulties with their manager and Paul's grandpa on the loose and delivering antics , craziness and mayhem . The boys seem to be constantly on the run and showing a lot of example of wry sense of humor , while escaping from their crazed fans and from their manager, who is constantly trying to rein them in. All 4 flopheads show a deft touch with throwaway joke here and there . The surrealist frames , slastick images and hilarious scenes are legion . The charming best scenes are a chaotic press conference , and a wild as well as wacky fling as the Beatles escape from it all for a few minutes in a field with likeable scenes filmed in relaxed music video style . The popular and wonderful group performs a dozen or so songs. And adding Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's unconventional grandfather who is available for additional comical relief, giving a very sympathetic acting along with Ringo Starr , as the band must rescue them from various misfortunes and misadventures .
The motion picture was originally directed by Richard Lester providing attractive images in its own right , being filmed in his peculiar style coupled with typical surrealist comic touches , being well accompanied by a brilliant cinematography in black and white by Gilbert Taylor . Richard Lester's gimmicky camera-trickery , fast and slow-motion , jump-cuts and it has dated badly . At the beginning Lester directed various Beatles vehicles as ¨How I won the war¨, ¨Help¨ and subsequently made known comedies : ¨The knack¨ ¨A funny thing happened on the way to the room¨, ¨The Ritz¨, ¨The mouse on the moon¨, a satire : ¨The bed sitting room¨ , Adventures : ¨Royal Flash¨ , ¨Robin and Mariam¨, Western : ¨Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid : the early days¨, and drama : ¨Petulia¨ , ¨Cuba¨ . He got a big success with ¨The Three Musketeers¨ (1973), which he shot simultaneously with ¨The Four musketeers¨ (1974) for producer Ilya Salkind , resurrected his career . When the Salkinds (Ilya and his father Alexander Salkind) were in the midst of filming ¨Superman¨ (1978) simultaneously with its sequel, Lester was hired as a supervising producer, then took over the filming of the sequel, ¨Superman II¨ (1980), when original director Richard Donner was fired . The sequel was a financial and critical success , and he was hired to direct the far-less successful ¨Superman III¨ (1983). At the end of the 1980s, Lester returned to the storyline that had revitalized his career back in the early 1970s, filming a second sequel to ""The Three Musketeers"" titled : ¨The return of the musketeers¨ . However, after his close friend, actor Roy Kinnear died during the shooting , Lester seemed to lose heart with the movie-making business , he has not directed another film.",A Hard Day's Night

2253,13,blanche-2,"Influential, like the Beatles themselves",9/10,4 June 2014,"I was part of the Beatles generation, a freshman in high school when they came to America. You couldn't help but get mixed up with them whether you liked them or not. They were everywhere. Everything about them was special to teenage girls: their accents, the British colloquialisms, their clothes - it was indeed a British invasion.The Beatles would go on to have many peaks of popularity because they and their music evolved. A Hard Day's Night was done at their first ""peak"" (but let's face it, they didn't have much non-peak time). Frankly, it's a work of genius, as far as I'm concerned. The Beatles here are the '60s version of the Marx Brothers and completely natural, funny, crazy, strange, and uniquely talented. The movie is a day in the life of the Fab Four, with lots and lots of their music intertwined. The writer, Alun Owen, followed the Beatles on their French tour and put the script together based on his observations. He tagged John as a smart aleck, Paul as cute but practical, George as quiet, and Ringo as kind of slow. He also worked to get their speech and daily routines into the script. When they went to film it, the Beatles did a lot of improvisation, some of which was incorporated after the film.It's a black and white movie, using jump shots, which were quite new, and it really set the stage for other musical movies to come.Seeing A Hard Day's Night today, it was an innocent time in general and for the Beatles, who were still pretty provincial. They were exuberant in their fame; that would change later. Unlike some other groups, where people played in a band and went their separate ways, the Beatles were always together, it seemed, at least in the beginning.One piece of trivia: On the night they appeared on Ed Sullivan, John Lennon appeared in the dressing room of Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, who also performed though they couldn't hear a word the other was saying because of the screaming fans. The Coke machine was in the Brill-McCall dressing room. John came in, got a Coke, and sat down and talked to Charlie Brill. As he talked, he drew something on a napkin and signed it. Then he left. ""What a pompous jerk,"" Brill said -- and tossed the napkin in the wastebasket.Charlie Brill now knows that was a big mistake. They were no flash in the pan. They were the Beatles and they just got better and better. This movie captures them and London at a moment in time with the screaming fans, the music, and the excitement about the Beatles that I'll always remember.",A Hard Day's Night
2254,14,Quinoa1984,Ladies and gentlemen - THE BEATLES!,10/10,2 March 2008,"You know em, you love em, cant get enough of em (depending on the voracity of the particular fan, current or nostalgic), the Beatles are two things at once: a nifty rhythm and blues band that can play (at least in this 'Fab-Four' early era) all sorts of cool three-minute songs dedicated to loving this or that girl, lamenting some loss, and solid blues and rock standards. And they're also a pop phenomenon that unlike boy bands or other pop acts of today aren't made from conglomerated formations. The brilliance of Hard Day's Night is that director Richard Lester takes on the Beatles phenomenon for what it is, makes it an exuberant feast of rock and fun and screaming girls, and at the same time makes of the funniest British comedies of the last fifty years. He mixes documentary style with some of the New Wave techniques from France and elsewhere with a zany rhythm that is distinctly his own. Lester's next Beatles film, Help!, might have more laughs per capita, but it's this film that marks him as something of a minor genius.There isn't much need for plot, and it's a good thing too- plot, unless if it's the kind from Help!, gets in the way of the Beatles natural riffs and jabs and of course the music. It follows one day in the life of the Beatles as they escape from hordes of screaming pre-teen/teen girls, gear up and practice for their upcoming show, and bits of wackiness in-between. Most of this involves Paul's grandfather (played in such a fine toss-up between deadpan and insane/senile by Wilford Brammell), who wanders off or tempts Ringo with the ideals of ""parading"" instead of drumming and reading, or just minor technical issues with the Beatles' managers and organizers of the event. There's no nonsensical plot to thrust our stars into like with Elvis; it's if anything probably closer to the madness of that time and place for them than anything else (i.e. the press room, where, according to the Beatles Anthology documentary, THOSE kinds of questions really were asked).Meanwhile, as Lester delivers some usually clear-cut scenes edited without much fuss or muss he also digs into creating Hard Day's Night as a fantasy mixed with this strange reality of Beatle-mania. Seeing the Can't Buy Me Love scene, in its own rough-hewed way, is as joyous as anything in Signin' in the Rain. And then it shifts to being funny while also going for an underlying sense of loneliness with these guys, like Ringo's walk along the riverside contemplating what to do with himself. And then there's just general hilarity that more than likely inspired Monty Python, like when George is thrust into a questionnaire about fashion, or just getting a crazy look at John in the bathtub. And let's not forget the music... OK, lets. Seriously, even if it's not your favorite period of Beatles music (and, for me, they would hit their peak and run with it two years later with Rubber Soul and Revolver), it's still a gas to see them play and enjoy themselves all the while doing it. They don't over-do their theatricality like bands of today, and they never look like ""oh, it's just another gig."" On stage, as with the film itself, energy rollicks it all the way through. You want your classic Beatles, here it is, packaged like a a crispy and nutty chocolate bar of rock and 60s hipness. A+",A Hard Day's Night
2255,15,sunwarrior13,Dated But Still A Great Musical Movie,10/10,15 September 2012,"A Hard Day's Night is a British black-and-white comedy film directed by Richard Lester that features the The Beatles — John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr — at the height of Beatlemania. It was written by Alun Owen. The film was made in the style of a mockumentary, describing a couple of days in the lives of the group.Using a variety of techniques cribbed from Hollywood slapstick comedies, the French ""new wave"" movement, and his own experiences as a TV- commercial director, Lester fashioned an exhilarating study of a ""typical"" 36 hours in the lives of the Fab Four. Onto a plot about getting to the Big Show on time are hung a series of instant-reaction gags, character vignettes, and musical setpieces. Much of the humor arises from Paul McCartney's efforts to keep his grandfather, a ""clean old man,"" from getting into mischief. Also good for several laughs is the hookey-playing Ringo Starr, whose mistimed declaration of independence lands him in jail. We are also treated to a war of nerves between the unflappable John Lennon and an uptight TV director, who worries that, should the Beatles not show up at broadcast time, he'll be demoted to ""News In Welsh."" George Harrison stars in a sequence in which he is mistaken for an auditionee by the producer of a superficially trendy, teen-oriented TV weekly. Then there's Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers, who carry on a battle royale simply because one man is taller than the other. The supporting cast includes comedienne Anna Quayle, cartoonist Bob Godfrey, TV host Robin Ray, dancer Lionel Blair, Harrison's future wife Patti Boyd, and director Lester himself. The songs include ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""Tell Me Why,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and the title song,""A Hard Day's Night"".This humorous mockumentary of the Beatles had a huge impact, forever changing the definition and limits of the musical movie genre for it captures the Beatles when they still looked like they were having fun, back before drugs and psychedelia and Yoko Ono took effect.The result still seems fresh and different decades later.",A Hard Day's Night

2257,17,Doylenf,Beatle mania when it was at its peak in the crazy '60s...,6/10,13 February 2008,"First, let me say, I've always been indifferent to the Beatle craze so I'm not the most reliable or objective reviewer you're likely to find. However, wanting a good look at the '60s era that created them, I watched the film dutifully and these are my comments.The girl screaming thing gets the film off to a jaunty start with the Beatles dashing for a train--and the joyride goes on for the length of this very frisky tribute to the four lads with the cheeky and rather quirky sense of humor, British style. The songs are nicely woven into a plot full of Beatle antics, never stopping the action but instead providing a good background for the visuals.I didn't get the bit about Paul's grandfather being constantly referred to as ""a very clean man""--just one of the jibes that was over my head, but the humor is abundant everywhere, extending to lines like: ""Stop being taller than me!"" A lot of the humor misses the mark if you don't catch the drift, so I watched it with the caption feature on my remote to catch the full flavor of the lingo.The songs are an enjoyable bunch, especially ""And I Love Her"", and the film itself is diverting enough for even non-Beatle fans to enjoy.Entertaining fun.",A Hard Day's Night
2258,18,CinemaSerf,Loads of charm and great music...,7/10,27 January 2021,"Who says there were no pop videos in the 1960s? This is an example of one, two, three - indeed, possibly five - all loosely connected via a daftly enjoyable storyline featuring old ""Steptoe"" himself - Mr. Wilfrid Bramble. It has a plot, not that it remotely matters: the fab four are heading to London to do a television show and poor old Ringo gets separated - much to the chagrin of the programme's director. What ensues are various enjoyable escapades interspersed with some dapper performances from the band. The thing is riddled with charisma - the band are clearly having a whale of a time, Bramble looks like startled rabbit - as only he could - and the scenes with the screaming fans contribute well to the overall sense of adulation in which this band were held. It makes no pretence to be a film of great cinematographic worth - which is just as well 'cos it isn't - but as 90 minutes of almost fly-on-the wall fun and games, it's well worth a watch.

They have to deal with Paul's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a neurotic TV director (Victor Spinetti), their long-suffering managers and tons of screaming fans.No real plot, just a lot of very lively sequences overflowing with one-liners and non sequiturs. The tone of the scenes go all over the place--one is full of verbal puns, the next visual gags, then absurdity reigns, THEN surrealism! It's a credit to director Richard Lester that he manages to keep all these various shifts in tone flowing smoothly. It's great to see that the Beatles are obviously enjoying themselves every minute. Some of the jokes are obscure (the ""clean"" jokes were based on remarks made about the Beatles back in 1962) and the accents are sometimes difficult. But it's great to see the Beatles so young and full of life and when they sing the film becomes magical. Also they have a good cast backing them up--Brambell and Spinetti are just great (and very funny). If you don't like the Beatles or their music, you might want to skip this film.

2261,21,Boba_Fett1138,Comedy with The Beatles.,8/10,20 April 2011,"This is a rather special and unusual but fun nevertheless, movie.It's really not a typical movie and it doesn't necessarily follow a plot or anything. You could say that this is basically like one big marketing video for The Beatles. It shows the four Beatles, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon as themselves, having lots of fun with partying and girls and doing lots of other very immature stuff. And yes, occasionally they of course also perform some of their songs. It probably sounds like something negative but no, I actually like this movie very much. It's simply so much fun to watch throughout!It's a real comedy, that shows The Beatles from their funny sides and the movie does actually feature some fun dialog and good silly comical situations. It stars The Beatles as themselves but please don't think they are not acting and they really lived like that. It's no documentary by any means and it allows The Beatles to show themselves from their funny and artistic side.It's a movie that dates back from the early Beatle years and got made at the verge of their big breakthrough. In that regard this already is a special and musically significant movie to watch. All of The Beatles were still in their early 20's and the movie showed them as rebellious young boys, all doing their own thing and already having their unique sound and style. Even almost 50 years later the songs are still catchy and you don't necessarily have to be a familiar or a big fan to enjoy listening to their songs in this movie. But it's a movie from the early days of The Beatles, so don't expect to hear all of your favorite Beatle songs in this movie. It features some well known songs but most of them just aren't that well known, which is not saying that it are horrible songs though.It by no means is a great done movie though. I mean, stuff is happening really very random in this movie and it obviously was a cheap one to make as well. The movie really thrives on its charismatic 4 leading men and their chemistry together.Not that any of The Beatles were great or natural born actors though. Their acting performances really aren't great but what saves them is that they basically are simply playing themselves, which did not require an awful lot of acting skills obviously.Great fun promotion for The Beatles, from their early days.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Hard Day's Night

2263,23,neil-476,One of the very best,10/10,4 April 2012,"From the opening, with that iconic chord, to the very end, A Hard Day's Night is a celebration of The Beatles hitting their stride.The episodic non-story tells of a day in their hectic life, being shunted from pillar to post as they travel to do a TV show, Ringo goes missing between rehearsal and performance, and then they leave for the next engagement. In between this (which, allowing for artistic licence, was probably not an unfair representation of the unrelenting pace of their lives throughout 1963 and 1964), there are opportunities for each of them to have a little bit of their own and, fortunately, some songs.Filmed documentary style in black and white by American Dick Lester, this is the film which took him up into another league. He was helped immeasurably by a strong script from Liverpudlian Alun Owen which captured the essence of the public face of The Beatles, and a strong supporting cast. The Beatles themselves, of course, were at the heart of the film's success: despite the fact that they weren't always able to hide their inexperience as actors, their sheer force of personality carried the day.

2264,24,AlsExGal,The Beatles were not actors...,9/10,6 October 2016,"...but they were great entertainers, and this film is great entertainment. This is the best of all of the rock and roll films that feature the actual performers. This picture demonstrates The Beatles at the peak of their popularity in the Summer of 1964- wandering about London- with the ultimate soundtrack in the background. A fascinating homage to Beatlemania when viewed now- over half a century later. The inventive boys from Liverpool are displayed at their sarcastic and witty best in this natural setting. A Hard Day's Night is a great example of the early Beatles musical ability, and work product, being that the title tune was written in about 20min between finishing an American tour, a European tour, a plethora of television specials, recording an LP in Paris in German for the Deutschland market, writing and recording the Hard Day's Night LP as well as making this film all within the same year, and before May of that year. After which, they all went on a month long vacation, recorded another album and began work on the next film. These guys were driven workaholics at this time, and their collective creative synergy has never been seen again.There wasn't anywhere The Beatles could go without being mobbed, thus they spent years boxed up in hotel rooms together to the point where they knew each other so well they often finished each others sentences during interviews. As a group of young men going through that type of stress day in and day out, they had to develop coping skills in order to keep it together, it seems they chose humor as their main tool. This movie shows us a little bit of that. Genius casting is evident in Hard Days Night with the inclusion of Irishman Wilfred Brambell as Paul McCartney's incorrigible Grandfather. Brambell was only 52 at the time but looked 82. At the time Brambell was very well known to British audiences due to the popularity of his television character named Albert Steptoe in a show called Steptoe and Son. Brambell's 1960s character Steptoe was the basis for the Fred Sanford character played by Redd Foxx on the 1970s American TV show ""Sanford and Son"". Look fast for a 13 year old Phil Collins in the audience as a screaming fan and look even faster for 20 year old Pattie Boyd as a schoolgirl on the train ride.",A Hard Day's Night
2265,25,ferguson-6,I'm a Mocker,9/10,16 July 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 50th anniversary and what a treat to see the re-mastered, restored film in a crowded theatre - many wearing their Beatles shirts. The quasi-documentary, cinema verite' approach from director Richard Lester may not fit the traditional idea of a great movie, but at a minimum, it's a fantastic pop culture artifact showing a world on the verge of change.This is The Beatles first film and this is the most innocent and fresh-faced we ever see them ... it's just a few months after their first appearance on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"". John is the most guarded, but his quick wit and distrust of the establishment are obvious. Paul is at his cutest and least arrogant, but still managing to pose on cue. George comes across most open and full of joy - before he became the most publicly withdrawn. Ringo is self-deprecating and in full hang-dog mode.For a stark contrast, watch the four lads a year later in HELP!, also directed by Mr. Lester. The luster of fame has clearly tarnished and they are quite aware of the power they wield. Still, during this shoot, we are almost ""on set"" as the boys are first experiencing Beatlemania! In addition to the Fab Four, British actor Wilfrid Brambill plays Paul's Grandfather. The recurring gag of him being ""very clean"" is a play on Brambill's long-running role as Albert Steptoe in ""Steptoe & Son"" where he is referred to as ""a dirty old man"". Victor Spinetti plays the very anxious TV director wearing the infamous sweater. Mr. Spinetti also appeared in HELP! (1965) and The Magical Mystery Tour (1967). Richard Vernon played the grumpy old man sharing the train car with the boys. Mr. Vernon also appeared in Goldfinger that same year. Another James Bond link occurs when Ringo is invited to the Le Cercle Club ... the same club James Bond first appears in Dr. No (1962). Lastly, Pattie Boyd is one of the giggly schoolgirls on the train and appears in 3 different scenes. 18 months later, she was married to George Harrison ... and a few years later, she proved her attraction to lead guitarists by marrying Eric Clapton.I was caught off guard by the frenetic pace of the film ... it has been 3 decades since I last watched it. But mostly, I was stunned at the clean look of this restored version and was awed by the terrific sound, especially of the song restorations completed by Giles Martin, the son of Beatles record producer George Martin ... who was nominated for an Academy Award for his film score.The film inspired the 1960's TV show ""The Monkees"", and of course, the soundtrack was a massive seller. ""If I Fell"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs and it's a nice segment in the film, but the real climax is the performance of ""She Loves You"", replete with terrific crowd shots. The impact and lasting impression of the film is every bit as recognizable as that stunning opening chord to the title track that opens the film.",A Hard Day's Night
2266,26,anaconda-40658,The Ultimate Beatles Film.,10/10,21 July 2015,"A Hard Day's Night (1964): Dir: Richard Lester / Cast: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Wilfrid Brambell: A tremendous tribute to the Beatles regarding the height of their career where the seemingly normal becomes out right bizarre. They are John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison and together they deal with screaming female fans, nagging management, and Paul's grandfather who has his own agenda when receiving all four signatures on a photograph. Directed by Richard Lester with many hilarious moments and great musical numbers. It celebrates the reality that The Beatles became the biggest band in history. At one point it was claimed that they were bigger than Jesus himself although such claims must be taken from an amusing standpoint. The year that this film was released The Beatles made their now classic appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. This film is shot in appropriate black and white and more or less follows each member of the band particularly Ringo who goes off on the town with Paul's grandfather where they are arrested. Wilfrid Brambell is quite funny as McCartney's grandfather whose ideas are best left forgotten in terms of his influence. Hilarious documentary style comedy that simply plays out the humorous nature often associated with one of the most famous and celebrated bands in music history. Score: 10 / 10",A Hard Day's Night
2267,27,Wuchakk,Shut Up and Sing,6/10,15 February 2017,"Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a musical comedy starring the Beatles at the initial explosion of 'Beatlemania.' The movie focuses on several days in the lives of the members while in England, including recording music and a concert at the end with the requisite screaming pubescent girls.While the Beatles were before my time, they were indeed great. There was something about the chemistry of the members that produced catchy hit after hit during their decade together from 1960-1970. When ""A Hard Day's Night"" (the movie) was released in the summer of '64, simultaneously with the album of the same name, they had only three albums of material released in two years, 1963-1964. The producers wanted to get a movie out before their popularity waned, like practically every other pop rock artist or group. But their fame was not to decline, as their appeal spread to young and older alike. They would release four more movies before breaking up, if you include the animated ""Yellow Submarine."" ""A Hard Day's Night"" is considered a cult movie, and I can see why. It captures the group while they're not much more than kids, still in shock about their skyrocketing success. The best parts, of course, are the music numbers, which play like what would later become known as music videos. Seriously, any time one of their hooky ditties starts playing your attention perks up and your feet & hands start moving in delight. It's the in between scenes that are problematic. You might enjoy these sequences more than me if you're enamored by the members. I'm not; I just like their music. I suppose it doesn't help that these episodes are plagued by mumbling dialogue with the corresponding English accent, not to mention British humor from the time period that I mostly don't 'get.' The film runs 87 minutes and was shot entirely in England.GRADE: B-",A Hard Day's Night
2268,28,christopher-underwood,it seems unfair that Paul gets lumbered with the awful Brambell,7/10,4 December 2018,"Its some considerable time since I had seen this and still had fond memories, particularly of Richard Lester's iconic b/w look. Well, the b/w look is still there and looking even better in wondrous Blu-ray but you have to wonder about some of the performances, the material and the script. I know at the time not much was expected of the film and the general rush was so as to get it out before the lads lost their popularity. Not much chance of that in hindsight but the songs are really somewhat lacking and in truth it really is only the title track that has any zing. Time may have been unkind to the dialogue but it strikes me that apart from the odd aside (ad-libbed?) this is rather embarrassing. Also, I realise that Wilfred Bramble was big at the time as 'the dirty old man' in Steptoe but boy did they push that 'clean' joke that was never funny, even at the time. Norman Rossington is completely wrong in the movie and is given the role of some bossy schoolmaster type and as he over acts it, again this becomes embarrassing. Generally the Beatles acquit themselves well enough but it seems unfair that Paul gets lumbered with the awful Brambell when the other three at least get one decent moment each. In this respect that of Ringo seems outstanding, particularly with regard to his chat with the young lad by the river. Overall the film remains important as a showcase for the four lads but perhaps even more importantly for the dynamic and influential way that this is shot helping to change the face not only of pop music videos but British cinema as well.",A Hard Day's Night
2269,29,JamesHitchcock,The Beatles in their Springtime,8/10,27 August 2008,"""A Hard Day's Night"" (a title based on a remark once made by Ringo) was made to cash in on Beatlemania while it was still in its early days. The film's plot, such as it is, concerns the group catching a train to London where they are due to take part in a live TV broadcast. They are accompanied on their trip by Paul's elderly grandfather, and are constantly pursued by screaming girls (something, of course, which frequently happened to the Beatles in real life). There is some consternation when Ringo goes missing, and ends up getting arrested, after Paul's grandfather suggests that he should get out and enjoy himself more, but all ends happily and he makes it back to the studio in time. The role of the old man is played by Wilfrid Brambell, an actor today best remembered for his role in the television sitcom ""Steptoe and Son"", in which he played Albert Steptoe, an elderly rag-and-bone man. In that series Albert was constantly referred to by his son Harold as a ""dirty old man""; hence the many references in the film to Brambell being a ""very clean old man"". In reality Brambell was only in his early fifties at the time, considerably younger than the characters he played both in the film and the TV series. The film was, of course, a great commercial success; given the enormous popularity of the Beatles at the time it could hardly have been otherwise, especially as it features many of their best-loved hits from this period. It was also critically well received at the time, and has continued to receive praise from the critics, largely because of its influence on later films. Leslie Halliwell credited the film with ""leading directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties"". Roger Ebert stated that its director, Richard Lester, had created a ""new grammar"" of film because of its apparently spontaneous, mock-documentary style. Lester would go on to become a major Hollywood director; he also directed the Beatles' second film, ""Help!"".The trouble with ground-breaking films is that, with the passage of time, they can come to seem of limited interest to all except cultural historians and obsessive film buffs. What does ""A Hard Day's Night"" have to interest the general viewer more than four decades after it was made? The look of the film seems very dated today. Halliwell's comment has always struck me as being wide of the mark, as ""kaleidoscopic"" is not the first adjective that comes to mind to describe a black-and-white movie. I cannot see any obvious influence that ""A Hard Day's Night"" might have had on the likes of, say ""Blow-Up"" or ""The Ipcress File"". The film's improvisatory look probably had less to do with any deliberate attempt to create a ""new grammar"" than with the need to make the film as quickly and cheaply as possible to cash in on the lucrative Beatles fan market. None of the Beatles nurtured serious acting ambitions, although Ringo was later to give a good performance in ""That'll Be the Day"". After making his only non-Beatles film, ""How I Won the War"" (also directed by Lester), John Lennon was to brand acting a ""silly"" profession. Here, however, the Fab Four are all essentially playing themselves in roles which call for naturalness rather than sophisticated acting techniques, and all four come across as both likable and amusing. The script is, for the most part, not great, and the comedy is fairly inconsequential, although there are some occasionally sharply witty parts that stand out. I particularly liked the scene where George is being interviewed by that dreadful phoney TV producer, and puts him firmly in his place. This exchange may have been motivated by a concern that the youth culture of the sixties was being deliberately manipulated for financial reasons. (It is also said by some to contain the earliest recorded use of the word ""grotty""). I also liked the strangely poetic scene where Ringo is wandering by the canal. What the film does have for the modern viewer is some wonderful music. In 1964 ""Sergeant Pepper"" and the band's other more innovative work still lay in the future, as did long hair, psychedelia, drug experiments and transcendental meditation. The Beatles were not yet a four-man cultural revolution; they were just four ordinary Liverpool lads with an extraordinary musical talent, producing some of the most wonderful, melodic, heart-lifting love songs ever written. We do, of course, get to hear a number of these; not just the title song but also ""She Loves You"", ""I Wanna be Your Man"", ""All My Loving"", and several others. (I know any serious Beatles fan will have all these in his or her music collection, but it's still worth hearing them in another context). As a comedy the film deserves perhaps 5/10; as a record of what Ebert aptly called the Beatles' ""lovely springtime"" that rises to 8/10.",A Hard Day's Night
2270,30,MovieAddict2016,Classic Beatles film,8/10,30 January 2006,"A study of a day in the life of a mega-popular UK rock band in 1964, ""A Hard Day's Night"" does nothing to disguise its performers: they may be playing characters, but they're the Beatles.This is essentially just a movie that follows them around as they lead a day of their ""ordinary"" lives - packed with raving female fans, musical jam sessions, and comic mishaps.This isn't as ""great"" as some people (mainly Beatles fanatics) would lead you to believe -- if it weren't for the Beatles' presence, nobody would even be watching it. I'm not saying it's a poor film -- I'm saying without their presence, it wouldn't be as engaging or interesting because it would just be watching actors playing musicians.

Lester and the Beatles are among the high points of his career. This movie and Help! were film works which made the Beatles a solid hit world wide. This movie presents them at their height. The sad thing about the amount of talent this group had is that it ended so soon. Their success made them huge for about 6 years after this film. Then all that success made the group fall apart in 1971, never to get back together again. One can only imagine what music might have resulted if that success had not shortened things. Even as single acts after the break up, they all had success. The Beatles led the way to modern rock music and this movie documents it.",A Hard Day's Night

2273,33,cherold,often brilliant comedy with great songs,8/10,16 September 2019,"A Hard Day's Night is a largely plotless romp with the Beatles telling jokes and running around. It's also a hugely influential work by Richard Lester that brought New Wave ideas into a more entertaining framework and created much of the grammar for future music videos. The film represents one of the few times a rock band movie had a genuinely talented director in charge, and it's a must-see for anyone who likes the Beatles or is interested in film history.Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style, not much happens. Paul's uncle gets in trouble, Ringo gets out of sorts, and girls scream. The Beatles' Liverpool accents and breezy personas were unusual in films of the time, and while you can't necessarily say any of them can act except Ringo, they are utterly charming.A youth-against-the-man theme runs throughout the movie, starting with an encounter with an obnoxious train passenger (who is probably in the right) and reaching its apex in the movie's best scene, where George gently mocks a corporate trend manipulator.The songs are, of course, wonderful. Some musical numbers are little more than the Beatles sitting and playing, but the opening of Hard Day's Night is an extended chase and Can't Buy Me Love is a lot of joyful hijinks that is a classic of its kind.The weakest part of the movie is the last section, in which the Beatles perform in a studio before an audience of screaming girls. The hysteria is somewhat entertaining, but for the most part this is just the Beatles performing songs that were already played earlier in the movie.If you like this movie, check out other Richard Lester films like The Knack and How to Get It.",A Hard Day's Night
2274,34,Lejink,A Day In Their Lives,7/10,23 July 2014,"Just passed its 50th anniversary now, ""A Hard Day's Night"" remains a fresh and exuberant film capturing the energy and spirit of the young Beatles as they get through a typical day of travelling, press-conferences and musical appearances. Interspersed are several of the group's numbers, some are from past singles and albums while most are from the newly- minted soundtrack album and containing such new classics as the title track and smash single ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""And I Love Her"" and ""If I Fell"".The movie is slightly fleshed out by the ten minute concert at the end but before that the boys are given ample acting opportunity at which they acquit themselves surprisingly well given it's their collective debut. Yes, there's a touch of stereotyping in their respective personae, the rebellious Lennon, romantic Paul, deadpan George and sullen Ringo, but it's also possible to detect some likely improvisation by them, which only adds to the overall spontaneity. Writer Alun Owen has a good ear for the Liverpool vernacular and inserts some neat jokes although I could have done with less of Wilfred Brambell's meddlesome role as Paul's grandfather. The running joke about him being very clean wouldn't have been lost on British viewers who knew Brambell better as the ""dirty old man"" Steptoe Senior character from TV's ""Steptoe and Son"".Director Richard Lester does his task with invention and vigour, his camera rarely standing still and employing several tricks to play up the gags and boost the story. Even unintentional goofs, like George falling over in the initial scene which has the group escaping their Beatlemaniac fans and later backing into his amplifier on a later song only add to the fun. Quite what John Lennon's wife of the time made of his woman-chasing screen-demeanour is anyone's guess however.What's good for me as a fan though is to see the Beatles as near as possible in their natural environment, obviously enjoying their success and each other's company at the same time. The group harmony wouldn't last but it did long enough for them to ultimately ditch both the outlets of cinema and live performances in pursuit of musical excellence, the right choice of course as things panned out.",A Hard Day's Night
2275,35,ElMaruecan82,"Loved every bit, and every beat, of it!",9/10,10 April 2021,"Now that I think about it, reviewing is all about verbalizing emotional reactions, it's an exercise that involves both our intellect and our affect and sometimes finding the exact word to describe this or that feeling is such a struggle the review stops being spontaneous, and worse, being fun.And so, for the sake of embracing the happy, genuine and positive spirit of ""A Hard Day's Night"", I will simply relieve my mind from such torture and describe it as it caught me and as I caught it. And I will say that I just loved every bit and every beat of it (that's for the title). As soon as the unmistakable guitar riff announces the titular song and that Ringo, John and George start running from a group of hysterical groupies, I felt like Marge Simpson being caught up in the ""You don't win friends with salad"" Konga and felt the need to run with them (funny that it made me think of the episode with Paul McCartney and wasn't Marge Ringo's number one fan by the way?).Anyway, there was just something so exhilarating in these four, sorry, three well-dressed young lads with semi-long hair having so much fun as they gallop right to the train station, a sort of ode to youthful insouciance and a nice warm-up to the iconic ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence. The energy brought up by the film's first minutes amazed him me and so did the gentle chemistry between John, George, Ringo and Paul. Paul is first seen wearing a false bread which is such a desperately risible attempt to anonymity it's revealing about the good-natured humor of the film.To contain the battery of exuberance within the quartet, there are some nice supporting chaps: the long-suffering road manager Norm (Norman Rossington) who's first introduced in a one-to-one battle with an orange juice pack and there's his poor well-meaning assistant Shake (John Junkin). Norm keeps blaming Shake for being taller than him, heightism adds nothing to the plot but it's enjoyable precisely because it's random and plausible despite its bizarreness.Many aspects of the film are beyond reality but with still a realness of their own, not saying Richard Lester tried to emulate surrealistic directors like Bunuel but the laws of cinema are impenetrable: many artistic achievements ensue from projects that didn't mean to be revolutionary. Well, it doesn't always work, but here it does, and how!Getting back to the supporting cast: there's an odd presence in the form of an old man who's referred to as (Paul's) Grandfather. He's played by Wilfrid Brambell who's got an angular face that seems to belong to a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. ""Who is he?"" is so repetitively asked it becomes a running gag, the answer comes later when the troll-faced old fruit brings with his malicious grin an unexpected zest of anarchy making the Beatles look like boy scouts, being as good a hell-raiser as a conversation-starter, a spicy seasoning to an overall delicious meal.Of course, it's a musical film and there are extended sequences where we enjoy songs fullys, among them ""If I fell"", ""Can I be Your Man?"" or (my favorite) ""All my Loving"". These moments offer us some great close-ups on the Beatles' face as their most youthful (no moustache, no beard, no hippie-look yet) and so I was startled by how young and boyish John Lennon was. Paul McCartney had the cutest baby face and most expressive eyes, George Harrison struck me at the most serious and moody of the four but with the sexiest side look, and there's Ringo.Ringo has always been the most underrated Beatles, being more distant from the creative process, the film gives him a unique opportunity to reveal the touching insecurity he could hide behind his sunny smile, he looks passably grumpy when his friends teases him and you can tell he's the group's punch bag but not in a mean-spirited way. He's just adorable in his punctual sadness before he unleashes these illuminating smiles of his. Ringo is the film's unsung hero, he who inspired the song's title through a malapropism and got his own sequence that shows him as a tender misfit.Actually, each Beatles seems misfit and uncomfortable outside their bubble. You can tell they're tired by the same questions asked by journalists: ""are you a mod or a rocker? I'm a mocker"", replies Ring"". Constantly pressured by society and harassed by herds of squealing fans, they're rather introverted when they're alone. They read, wander and wonder, and only together, they find that communicative energy, between each other and with their audiences, whose screams are almost part of the experience, but the film shows many closeups of the crying adolescents, allowing them to be substantial characters to understand the Beatlemania.So those were the Beatles, four young boys who revolutionized music with simple lyrics whose form transcended their content. Four lonely souls with an energy within themselves that could finally implode in the ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (another staple of music imitated by the Simpson), a sequence of pure improvised zaniness in a playground that inspired countless parodies and that could be perhaps the most emblematic sequence of the baby boom generation. Now, I'm a 80s baby, I grew up with music clips and in my video projects, I just enjoy watching sequences mixing acting and music, making the human body as instrument to music as drums or guitars.And in that very film project I cherish for years, I had two scenes that are totally inspired by that extraordinary ""Can't Buy Me Love"" clip where random improvisation makes one with the music, and I had never seen the film before. Richard Lester did influence film-making by connecting the New Wave to the premises of video-making.And ""A Hard Day's Night' is a funny, witty, energetic, heart-warming, subversive without being controversial, cinematic whirlpool of emotions; a product of its time that is still cinematically relevant today, yeah, yeah, yeah!",A Hard Day's Night

2277,37,ericstevenson,So feel good,10/10,3 February 2018,"What I love about this movie is how authentic it is. I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of it and how interesting it was to learn that he was born on the same day as Paul McCartney! Anyway, what's amazing is how utterly realistic this movie is. It really does seem like a documentary. Most of this movie is just hanging out with the Beatles and them cracking some jokes and being interviewed. We of course get all their greatest songs.You could simply listen to those at day. It's such a relief to watch a good movie after being subjected to all these stupid films I've seen lately. It's funny how they're listed in the credits not as themselves, but as uh, themselves. Anyway, this is a really soft moving film. At first, I thought I would be mad that it was too short but instead the running time made it perfect. I guess you could call me a Beatles fan even if I'm not the biggest one.To a certain extent, this does seem like a really long music video. It does have a steady plot and it makes you feel like you're right there in on the action. It's hard to even believe that these people are acting. Well, they are playing themselves so it's technically not acting. There's tons of quotable dialogue and I especially like, ""It's an in-joke!"".

This movie doesn't have much of a plot, but the story isn't important, it's all about seeing John, Paul, George, and Ringo interact with each other and play some great songs. Many of the jokes may now feel a little dated, yet it's still infectiously entertaining to see the Fab Four have fun in this film.

2279,39,secondtake,Platinum Music on the Silver Screen--and so joyous!!,8/10,30 September 2009,"A Hard Day's Night (1964)I've loved the Beatles for as long as I can remember, and I love this movie because of that. I also really groove to the black and white photography, and Richard Lester's jittery, cutting edge camera style (influenced I suppose by the realistic films of Tony Richardson). The mix of mad cap energy and straight ahead songs is fun, and it goes places Elvis movies never did just for creativity and fun. The Beatles are way more edgy but they come off as not a bit jaded or spoiled, none of the bad-boy rocker stuff that gets old fast. In fact, A Hard Day's Night reminds you just how fresh and light the Beatles were in those first couple of years.There, that is said. Now for the truth about the movie as a narrative film, which I think it has some vague idea it wants to be (music aside). It bumbles around and plays with old (even then) tricks of picking on the old fashioned Britons in a comic way. I sometimes found myself trying to let one scene lead to the next, and really that's not the idea. The happy zany inter- scenes between songs are just inventive, fun, craziness. That probably enough, but if you've seen the movie a couple times already like I have, or if you don't automatically like the Beatles enough just to watch them for who they are, you will probably find your mind drifting. Not that it's not exciting. It's just aimless excitement.There, now that is said, too. So back to the start. What a fun, uplifting, non-conformist, sharp movie. Nice to see a genuine sense of humor are work, and a bunch of not-so-clean lads letting 'er rip.",A Hard Day's Night
2280,40,atlasmb,Entertaining And Significant,9/10,2 October 2021,"This mockumentary about the budding careers of The Beatles has much to recommend it.As a piece of entertainment, it offers some enjoyable performances by the Fab Four and the actors surrounding them, especially Wilfrid Brambell, who plays Paul McCartney's grandfather with a sure, comical expertise. Even more importantly, the freewheeling style of the film gives us a new genre that would be imitated many times. It owes a debt to the Marx Brothers, but it is so much more.The soundtrack includes many of the Beatles' early hits, which would become a blueprint for the future of rock music. Those songs are primarily ballads and rockers, written with seemingly simple lyrics that belie their originality and obscure the transformative future they would forge. As their creative talents matured, the four would unify the fabric of pop music, challenge the authorities of convention, explore the technological limits of instrumentation and recording, dominate the charts, inspire thousands of musicians who would follow, and produce a fan base that transcends age groups and time.Those fresh faces of 1964, not yet marked by experience, would quickly change. In just six years, the arc of their ensemble career would be complete.

There isn't much of a plot - just a series of vignettes that appear spontaneous and unscripted. Lester, making only his second feature film, uses a hand-held camera much of the time, conveying a sense of urgency. It still feels fresh four decades later and is a precursor to the music videos that became popular two decades later. John, Paul, George, and Ringo show themselves to be natural actors. Musical highlights include ""All My Loving,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""She Loves You,"" and of course the title song.

In fact this is the first full length Beatle's movie, and is also in black and white, which shows you how old it is. Actually, I quite liked it, especially the scene right at the beginning where John Lennon is given a bottle of coca-cola and he starts snorting it (gee, they even have subtle drug references back it in sixties – but then again this is the Beatles).The film is basically a day in the life of The Beatle's, and is about how they travel from Liverpool to London to perform a concert. Mind you, it opens with them being pursed by a mob of adoring fans, and has them trying every trick to outwit them. They even throw a few more of these in when they arrive a various studios. Also, Paul's grandfather (the other one – he is entitled to have two you know) is coming along for a ride, and while he is supposed to be 'clean' he is anything but – including disappearing for the night to go and play bingo at an exclusive French casino.There are even a couple of jokes about the drummer, Ringo, who by the way is challenged about how he spends all day sitting inside reading a book, so goes off for a wander which causes the others all kinds of grief. The other thing that I noticed (or somebody else did, I just picked it up) is that there is a theme about since they are now the Beatles they actually don't have time to themselves anymore. Even at night they are dumped with a huge number of fan letters that they are told that they have to answer everyone.However, the main thing about this movie is the music. It is basically their earlier pop songs, so if you are looking for the psychedelic rock of their later years then unfortunately this isn't the film for you (maybe you should try Yellow Submarine, or Magical Mystery Tour). It is still quite a fun movie that got an applause from the audience at the end (but then again it was showing at Melbourne's cult movie cinema – the Astor).",A Hard Day's Night
2283,43,Dr_Coulardeau,Half a century later it's a pure diamond,10/10,23 November 2008,"When you are dealing with a myth you have to look for what was new at the time when that myth appeared. And the Beatles are such a myth. This film reveals the fabric the myth is made of. Pure cinematographic and even photographic silk. The four boys have to be running because at the time everything young and new was on the run since it was chased by the establishment in order to be pilloried and exposed. But it also had to show how these four young men had to be able to capture the attention of other people and bring them into the running, first of all young people, particularly girls, and second the best representatives of the establishment, coppers. The film also had to be in black and white to be out of time, eternal because looking old, even odd or oddly even. Then and but their music did not have to convince their audience. It was new, fresh, lively, light, slightly rocky and rather smoothly rolly, with some drums but not too much, and a lot of harmony and melody, but the main attraction was the use of simple catch phrases to express love, freedom, desire, alienation and yet liberation in a mellow and sweet wrapping, like the cute title of the film taken from one of the songs. Finally the film had to satisfy the audience on the lifestyle of the Beatles and on their surrealistic reality. That is done with a plot based on their real life as musicians, etc, and at the same time with constant reference to impossible, at times absurd, breaches in this realism into some impossible meaningless or humoristic pranks. In one word the film is so real that it reaches beyond reality and even the virtuality of a life imagined as being out of logic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",A Hard Day's Night

Lots of Beatle music and zany antics kept the action moving along nicely. It wasn't long on story, but played well anyway. Fun movie.

Instead, this is a surprisingly sophisticated film, driven by a popping comedic script, fantastic camerawork, and an anarchic spirit. It's a basically plotless hangout movie, and I'm totally down to hangout here for as long as possible.

2286,46,l_rawjalaurence,A Valuable Representation of Mid-Sixties London,8/10,8 July 2014,"Looked at in the cold light of day, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT has dated badly. Many of the gags fall flat on their face, while the visual style seems artificially jumpy, as director Richard Lester makes a labored attempt to emphasize the Beatles' liberated life. In terms of film history, however, the film occupies a seminal position; not only does it provide a record of the Beatles in performance, but it makes a conscious attempt to explain the Beatlemania phenomenon. The Fab Four not only introduced different musical styles into the Britpop world, but they were representatives of a new, swinging way of life that contrasted starkly with what had gone before. They were happy-go-lucky, free, not frightened to express themselves, and hedonistic - as seen, for instance, in the ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence where they gambol about on a school playing-field, shot from above by director Lester. In historical terms, the film offers a valuable portrait of mid-Sixties London, especially the contrast between 'old' and 'new' values. In one sequence the Beatles get into an argument with a city gent (Richard Vernon), who tries to stop them playing their transistor radio in the belief that, as a regular traveler on the train, he is somehow superior to them. Needless to say John Lennon immediately exposes the stupidity of such claims. The film is full of experimental visual styles, from the speeded-up chase sequence as the Fab Four are pursued by the London constabulary, to the rapid intercutting between the Beatles in performance and their adoring fans in the audience screaming themselves hoarse, And then there are the songs, which remain as fresh and original half a century on as they did when they were premiered. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT demands to be watched by anyone interested in social and popular music history, as well as Beatles fans young and old.",A Hard Day's Night

Asides from the original Ed Sullivan's show aired in February of 1964, I don't think there's a video that captures the godly wonder of the Beatles better than the Hard Days Night, and the songs are just fantastic as well. You'll know how great this movie and the Beatles as living entity are (were) when you compare this movie to the likes of ""Having a wild weekend"" by Dave Clarke Five which was made in similar vane around the same time. The latter absolutely didn't age gracefully as the Hard Days Night did.The movie is still great to watch, and is an important milestone in cinema history. Just fab(4)ulous !

2288,48,ackstasis,An Enjoyable Little Film From The Beatles,7/10,10 January 2007,"I've never really been a fan of the Beatles. This is not to say that I don't enjoy their music, but I'd simply never been exposed to much of it. However, in the past year, I'd started to listen to many of their songs, and I instantly understood why they were so popular. Back in 1964, the band's growing popularity had spawned numerous best-selling albums, and the next step was a natural one - a Beatles movie. And so 'A Hard Day's Night' was born.This modest-budgeted 1964 black-and-white film allegedly documents a ""typical"" day in the life of the Beatles. Whilst I'm aware that much of it was greatly exaggerated and dramatised for its portrayal on screen, I'm fairly certain that one thing has remained fairly accurate - the vast hoards of incessantly screaming teenage female fans who flock around the four performers, either during performances or in public. At the height of Beatlemania, I wouldn't be surprised if such scenes actually occurred on a regular basis.The four young actors of the band, who I, quite obviously, don't need to name, are not the most talented of actors, but they perform adequately. The screenplay simply calls for them to act as themselves, and this they do quite well. Norman Rossington is good as Norm - the Beatles' manager - and Wilfrid Brambell is hilarious as Paul McCartney's ""other grandfather,"" who has joined the band's travels for a ""change of scenery."" 'A Hard Day's Life' is an interesting little film, full of moments of joy and laughter and drama - and let us not forget the excellent soundtrack of (you guessed it) Beatles songs! It is not, in any real way, a groundbreaking film, though I've heard that the performance scenes greatly influenced how music videos were filmed at the time.However, if, like me, you were unfortunate enough to have missed out on the 1960s, and you've been wondering why the Beatles were as big as they were, this is your definitive answer!",A Hard Day's Night
2289,49,tadpole-596-918256,"How the ""Baby Boom"" went bust . . .",6/10,3 June 2014,". . . is much easier to understand when you watch A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). Everyone knows that the Baby Boom population explosion ended in 1964, the same year the Beatles boys' band spearheaded the so-called ""British Invasion."" This was no coincidence, as you'll see if you watch A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Every female pictured in this flick of child-bearing age--and there are thousands of them--is caught up in a frenzy of teary, screaming, energy-sapping mass hysteria. Their male peers are nowhere to be seen. At this time, self-styled demographers were freaking out about a ""population explosion,"" and the most explosive figure in the movies was the shadowy British intelligence operative James Bond. When you see A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, it becomes obvious that the ""British Invasion"" was a real-life Bond-like CIA\MI6 plot to curb the further arrival of ""excess"" American babies. In Colonial America Paul Revere may have warned us ""The British are coming, the British are coming!"" but this was something the flower of American youth no longer could do regularly once the Beatles came. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT resulted in a Lost Generation, which is why America is so badly out-numbered by Asians in today's world.",A Hard Day's Night
2290,50,st-shot,The Beatles as Marxists,7/10,26 November 2010,"The idea of putting pop stars and their band in movies goes back to Rudy Valle and his Connecticut Yankees in early sound. With a fan base and popularity already established a large audience capture would be inevitable even if the story line was tepid. As long as you injected a half a dozen songs or more into the plot it was a recipe for success. Vallee didn't take off but Bing and Elvis did and while Crosby had better scripts the lame Elvis vehicles killed at the box office.The Beatles phenomena was only a couple of years old when they released Hard Day's Night in 1964 and it predictably did excellent box office. What wasn't predictable was with the ease the Fab Four, albeit playing themselves, were at Marxian comedy. Under the stylishly hip (part mod, part nouvelle vague) direction of American ex-Pat Richard Lester, Night has an infectious energy that is bouyed by the comfortable impish charm of the quartet. Lester wisely avoids joining the boys at the hip allowing each his own space away from the other much of the film and they all comport themselves (especially Ringo) surprisingly well; though truth be told Wilfrid Bramble as Paul's rebellious grandfather steals every scene he is in. There's an album's worth of great tunes (still selling millions 45 years later) that make the film an even better listen but the band's brand of dead pan and anarchic humor (Marx Brothers light) is more than enough to sustain this very amusing little film on its own.",A Hard Day's Night
2291,51,robfollower,A Hard Day's Night (1964),8/10,10 April 2021,"""The Citizen Kane of jukebox musicals,"" The film surprised critics and film-goers alike. Previous rock-and-roll movies had been little more than showcases for the latest music, aimed at exploiting the youth market, cheaply made and melodramatic. Then along came A Hard Day's Night, one of the most finely crafted films ever made about rock-and-roll.Despite the seeming spontaneity of A Hard Day's Night, just two scenes-John in the bath) and the press conference -were improvised. The film's realism was a masterpiece of cinematic illusion, natural lighting, and tight cutting.Helping spread the ""Beatlemania"" that raged worldwide in the mid-1960s was A Hard Day's Night (1964), a semi-documentary comedy about 36 hectic hours in the life of the Beatles -- George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. This was the British pop group's first film; many still consider it the best.Director Richard Lester later acknowledged that A Hard Day's Night was put together quickly because it was thought The Beatles might be a passing vogue with little staying power. The movie was made in six and a half weeks, on a budget of only $500,000, and aimed primarily at English audiences. Premiering in theaters only three months after shooting began, the film became an international sensation and an instant classic.""A Hard Day's Night"" was written by Lennon, with McCartney's help. The songs include ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" ""Don't Bother Me,"" ""All My Loving,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You,"" ""This Boy (Ringo's Theme),"" ""Tell Me Why,"" ""She Loves You"" and the title song.",A Hard Day's Night
2292,52,rooprect,It's been a bo-ring movie... I should be sleeping like a log.,2/10,2 August 2006,"Listen up, you mindless, brainwashed Beatles fans. Just skip reading this review and click the ""did not find this helpful"" box at the bottom. Go on. I ORDER you to do it, you lemmings. I ORDER YOU NOW.Are they all gone? OK, let us proceed.I'm a Beatles fan, but I don't mindlessly applaud everything they've done. The Beatles I admire were the guys who wrote their own music, blended styles and philosophies of Eastern cultures, arranged symphonic movements, challenged our musical conceptions... and HAD PERSONALITIES. These qualities wouldn't surface until the 2nd half of their career after they had achieved sufficient confidence to dump the record company ""charm school"" that had made them.The first half of their career, up to and including this movie, they were just prettyboy pawns of the record industry. And that's exactly what we get. We get some record producer's lame idea of a Beatles movie, NOT a Beatles movie. They act like, talk like and look like what a record producer would portray. Nothing human, nothing passionate, not even funny. Just reading lines and lip synching their catchiest tunes (somewhat poorly, I might add... Paul gets a few lines wrong, but the cameras just keep on rolling).Maybe some folks will laugh at the fast-motion antics of the fab four running around a football field and acting like clowns, wrestling and hitting each other. But I'd just as soon skip over that and get to the heart of it all. Surprise. there's no heart. This is just an endless parade of predictable gags and goofiness that becomes downright embarrassing after the first 20 mins.I repeat: THIS IS NOT THE BEATLES. It's a carefully packaged dress rehearsal of what fans wanted the Beatles to be back in the early 60s. Fans loved it back then, I'm sure. But in retrospect, it's no more interesting than watching a 1964 commercial for Comet Liquid Soap.Skip this one, folks. Proceed directly to YELLOW SUBMARINE.

2293,53,JoeKarlosi,A Hard Day's Night (1964) ****,10/10,17 February 2006,"The Beatles' first classic movie is a nostalgic time capsule that manages to embody a very special age of innocence from the early 1960's, when four young men from Liverpool England practically took over the world with their marvelous music and charismatic charm and wit. Director Richard Lester is to be commended for successfully capturing all of the excitement and joyful hysteria of these times for historical posterity. For anyone new to The Beatles who's looking to discover what they were all about, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the perfect place to start. It showcases the four at the height of their early powers, before the psychedelic experimental period began and the latter breakup took its toll.Screenwriter Alun Owen spent some time with the Fab Four in late 1963, when a phenomenon christened ""Beatlemania"" was descending all across Great Britain. He began to get a good idea of their individual personalities and what he wanted to write for a proposed film which would start production sometime in March, 1964. Even more appropriately, the Beatles' world-astounding popularity soared still further in the interim, after they set foot on American soil in February of '64 and became household names. The market was ripe for this film, which it was decided would show the rigors of a typical day in the life of the band at the peak of their stardom. The resulting motion picture was funny, clever, delightful and of course, musical. John Lennon and Paul McCartney penned several songs for inclusion in the film, all of them winners and two of which easily became #1 hits (""Can't Buy Me Love"" as well as the title tune, which was actually made-to-order overnight after producer Walter Shenson asked for a song called ""A Hard Day's Night"" which could run along with the credits). The film is very British, and the decision to photograph in black and white nicely compliments the aura of England. The Beatles are shown traveling from gig to gig, performing music, doing interviews, trying to outsmart legions of adoring fans, and generally trying to have a good time amidst all the insanity. While the Beatles themselves were not professional actors, they hardly had to be as they were essentially just being themselves, albeit exaggerated caricatures: John the sarcastic and witty one, Paul the professional lady's man, George the quiet cynic, and Ringo the lovable but mistreated clown. Elder British comedian Wilfrid Brambell was also cast as Paul's meddling ""very clean old grandfather"", and is often humorous to watch, getting involved in all sorts of mischief, though perhaps the necessity of his character being added to the formula would be open to debate.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a special account of a very wonderful, if fleeting, moment from our entertainment history. We are very lucky to have this record of those special days to take us back and enjoy throughout the many different times yet to come.**** out of ****",A Hard Day's Night
2294,54,slokes,Pipers At The Gates Of Dawn,8/10,26 October 2004,"What can you say about the film that started it all? Where popular culture as we know it took shape in a ""let there be light"" Genesis kind of way? Where pop rock became worth listening and not just dancing to? Where John, Paul, George, and Ringo became firmly established as individual personalities as well as the premier entertainment troupe of the 20th century?Only this: ""A Hard Day's Night"" is good, yes, and significant, but it's fun, too. Still, and above everything else, it's a lot of fun.""A Hard Day's Night"" is probably more responsible for the Beatles' enduring image in our culture than any single song they made. It came out in 1964, within a few short months of the Fab Four's sensational appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that truly launched them globally, though they had been making great pop music for more than a year which was all the rage across Europe. ""Hard Day's Night"" captures the band when they were still relatively provincial and innocent, not yet in the ""marijuana for breakfast"" phase they were well into the following year when they made the zanier ""Help!"" LSD, Yoko, and the Maharishi were not even on the radar, nor was the psychedelic era the Beatles would usher in less than three years later. Finally ""Hard Day's Night"" clicked not only with the kids but the adults, who previously viewed the band as a motley band of overplayed haircuts. It gave all the generations of the time something they could agree on. These guys were good.The story of ""Hard Day's Night"" is thin by design. We see the Beatles in slightly fictionalized form, with a manager named Norm and a roadie named Shake, traveling by train across England and ducking into a studio to make a TV appearance. Paul has his grandfather along, a codgy old troublemaker who nevertheless is ""very clean."" The irony of the movie is that the old guy, played by British TV star Wilfrid Brambell, is the one that continually ruffles the feathers of society while the Boys themselves play things fairly straight and legal.Grandpa has the best take on the meager storyline: ""I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery, and so far I've been in a train and a room and car and a room and a room and a room!"" Brambell works very well in the film, a needful focal point in a film that requires some bearings in order to work. Of the Beatles themselves, Ringo makes the strongest single impression by showcasing his vulnerable side while John probably has the best moments with his wacky, caustic humor. George shines, too, in a scene with a trend-happy fashion maven, and married one of the girls on the train in real life, so he did pretty well here, too.Is it the best Beatles film? I think ""Yellow Submarine"" is better for what it's worth, but ""Hard Day's Night"" is the best film actually featuring the Beatles for who they were and what they were about.Great music, too. The sequence on the train with ""I Should Have Known Better"" still works as a video, with all the baggage-car bric-a-brac thrown in for ambiance. Then there's ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" which shows the Beatles in full-tilt boogie mode after momentarily escaping their studio confines. ""And I Love Her"" has some of the film's greatest camera work, very moody and intense in its focus on how well the Beatles worked in a TV studio setting.As a film, ""Hard Day's Night"" lacks a bit of heart. Not that it's cold or cruel, just a trifle too detached to get enveloped by, the way one does with great cinema. I don't really miss the fact that ""Help!"" wasn't a true sequel; ""Hard Day's Night"" works for its 90-plus minutes but doesn't leave you wanting more. The relationships between the band members, and with Grandpa, Norm, and Shake, are left unexplored, and you don't really miss that as much as you maybe should.But as a collection of small, witty moments interspersed with great music, ""Hard Day's Night"" is a pleasure through-and-through. Like the scene where John cuts the tailor's measure (""I now declare this bridge open"") or has that absurd corridor chat with Anna Quayle (""She looks more like him than I do."") Or when Ringo tells the crotchety train passenger who complains he ""fought the war for your sort"" that ""I bet you're sorry you won!""",A Hard Day's Night
2295,55,TOMNEL,Not much plot...but this really didn't need any.,8/10,1 October 2007,"""A Hard Days Night"" really is just supposed to be a day in the life of the Beatles. Of all the Beatles films, this one by far had the best dialog, and the most realistic plot. It's a chance to show off a few of their best songs at the time and make a fun and sometimes funny movie to go with it.I'd like to write a plot synopsis, but there really is very little plot. Most of the subplots in the film involve not the Beatles, but Paul's kooky grandfather, who's out to make a buck whether through gambling or selling fake signed pictures. Like in their next film ""Help"" the Beatles all have an odd acting style. They sort of act like little kids, playing with toys in the bathtub and such. Surprisingly it comes off well, and makes them seem innocent and likable. Plus, the songs are enough to get anyone hooked.This is by far the Beatles best film, and it was a real joy to watch.

Almost 40 years later, they are still as young as ever. Timeless, beautiful, true. A Hard Day's Night is perfection!

2297,57,onepotato2,A breath of fresh air,8/10,31 December 2007,"I'm not so naive as to think that money, production and marketing aren't operative in the presentation of the Beatles, but the wonderful thing about this movie is its simplicity; the enjoyment comes from personalities and a good natured put-on, not an enormous budget or overwrought thrills. The boys are very good at delivering some unusually funny scripted nonsense. Here they're almost restructured as the Marx brothers and the transformation is a pleasure.This movie is the kind of reminder Hollywood needs every once in a while that CGI, explosions, forced thrills, luscious eye-popping color cinematography and conventional thinking are all markedly less interesting than simple dry wit and honest effort. It's the film equivalent of the White Stripes; stripping a format down to it's essentials and sounding like a revelation. Only the standard straight boy bugaboo (terror of an effete man - Here, a TV producer) is stale. It's here the movie begins to lose some steam. And Lennon, apparently lacking charm, is a too desperate for laughs and tries too hard.But even after all these years the movie feels fresh and unforced. You do not have to like the Beatles (I'm indifferent) to really enjoy this movie.It's a trifle, but it's fricking terrific.",A Hard Day's Night
2298,58,Movie-ManDan,It Has Grown On Me.,8/10,11 April 2021,"The Beatles is arguably the best band ever. How many other bands can rival them? Led Zeppelin? Rolling Stones? Pink Floyd? Not very many. They were the biggest band of the 1960s, with the Beach Boys and the Monkees being their arch-rivals. When they released their first album in 1962, it was evident that they were destined for greatness. By 1964, they were on top of the world. They did a memorable performance on The Ed Sullivan Show and a movie was made to capture this band at the height of the their fame.Believe it or not, there were lots of people back then that didn't like the Fab Four. But when ""A Hard Day's Night"" came out, even its biggest haters were shocked at the wit and brains this movie had. Decades later, it is still being studied by film and music scholars.I absolutely love the Beatles. Every time music is played in this, greatness erupts. But in order for the movie to resonate with everyone, it can't be just the music that is great. Take the opening scene when they are being chased through the streets by fans. That remains one of the best and most iconic openings in film history.There was a time where I didn't like this, and for good reason. The movie is about shenanigans that the guys face while on tour. There isn't much of a story, other than Paul's grandfather disrupting things and Ringo having an inferiority complex. But really looking at the film, each character is fully developed and alive. Each scene, no matter how trivial, is enjoyable. There was just a time when I was expecting a story so original and so life-changing. A masterpiece isn't presented here, but it's still fine.Not sure how true this is to reality, but each man has memorable traits. George is an intellect, John is a jokester, Paul is caring and Ringo has low self esteem. As mentioned, the major of the film deals with Ringo and Paul's grandfather. They tangle through a couple of days on tour where they must deal with their own problems.If you are a fan of the Fab Four, go see this. If you aren't, go see this anyway. This wasn't the best film of the 60s, but it was the most influential in terms of styling and trendiness.3.5/4.",A Hard Day's Night

My mother as well as my father had a lot of records from what might well be the best-known pop/rock band ever and that's how I learned to appreciate their music at a very young age. I also knew that The Beatles had played in a couple of movies, but until now I never had seen one of them. Not really knowing what to expect, I hoped for the best and was willing to be surprised by it.This movie tries to show us what the 'average' day in the life of the Beatles looks like. Traveling through the country from one TV-studio to the next hotel room, they meet a lot of people, but also take their time to have a lot of fun together, much to the despair of their manager and crew who don't always know where they are at the times that they need them. And to complicate things a little bit more, they also have to take the grandfather of one of the guys with them and all he likes is to play little mind games with every person that he meets...Even though I didn't know anything about this movie in advance, I hoped that it would be some kind of documentary, showing how they had to deal with all the success and the crazy fans. In a way this movie does show that, but it wasn't exactly the way I hoped it would be. Realism clearly wasn't the first concern and too often you feel that some of the jokes have been staged. They just try to make you believe that this is a documentary, but the natural feeling of the documentary style is sometimes very far away and that's too bad. Does that mean that this entire movie isn't any good? No, certainly not. The music really makes it all worthwhile and it's nice to see some actual concert footage in between the staged performances.This film will be loved most by the fans of the first hour who want to see their idols once again, but in my opinion this isn't the kind of movie for the people who want to learn more about The Beatles. But even when you don't know much about them and you just love the music, than I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try. I know I didn't and I liked it a lot. I'm sure that many others in my situation will love it too, just don't expect to see reality. I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10. I loved the music, but wished for a little bit more of realism.",A Hard Day's Night
2300,60,begob,Still fresh!,10/10,8 October 2020,"A band manager finds it's like herding cats to get his defiant musicians ready for a concert recording.Aaaah! A satisfying time capsule, fresh as the day it was sealed up. Everything is slightly: slightly whacky, slightly subversive, slightly sexy. And yet quite a strange quality delivered by the grandfather, played by the endearingly off-putting Wilfred Brambell, with his horsey teeth and fish-hooked lip.The band members do a good job, but for me there were two unexpected revelations. First, John was not a dominant influence, either in personality or musicianship - he certainly had his way, but not so as to overawe anyone else. Second, Ringo is the heart of the drama, and his walkabout episode is completely charming.The look of the film is really crisp, with plenty of energy through the editing and the busy sets and locations. The girls in the cast all look sweet or glamorous. The only pang of nostalgia I got was from what possibilities there were for outsiders in London at the time, all now buried under commercial cynicism and financial big-dickery.There's one interesting exchange, between Paul and his grandfather, in which Paul judges him for missing his chance to go to America, where his deceitful nature would have led to his success. The grandfather shoots back: ""At least I'm clean!"" Plus there are several scenes that satirise the pseudo intellectual pigeon-holing of the media and marketing industries. But there's also a lot of sweetness and mischief in the humour, with two big moments from Brambell, as he swindles his way to a couple of betting chips, and gets whisked off stage after popping up unexpectedly.Overall: Energy still fresh after half a century.ps. It has the first recorded use of the word ""grotty"", and the title comes from Ringo's surprised comment when he woke from an exhausted snooze to find it dark outside - the titular song was composed eight days before the end of shooting, with lyrics from a birthday card John sent to his son.",A Hard Day's Night
2301,61,LeonardKniffel,Rather Tame Compared to Beatlemania,8/10,29 April 2020,"Even when it was released in 1964, this black-and-white oddity was not what anybody expected from the sensational Beatles. As a result, it is much more interesting years later than anyone could have expected. Instead of adding to the Beatles mythology, it brings the boys down to earth in quirky and eccentric ways, presenting some great songs in the process. Early Beatles was all about silliness, and this is a fine example, although it may leave you wondering what all the fuss was about. It takes forever to get to the songs, so this ends up less a musical and more a study, or a long and rather tedious music video. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013

2302,62,sme_no_densetsu,Lighthearted fun from Dick Lester and the Beatles,8/10,19 November 2010,"""A Hard Day's Night"" was filmed in early 1964 when Beatlemania was still in its relatively early stages. In the film the Beatles play themselves as they go through a typical 'day in the life', as it were.Though the boys had no previous acting experience they managed to do an admirable job of playing themselves here. That is, their on-screen personae seem to capture the appeal that made them successful entertainers off the screen. Apart from the Beatles the acting is pretty decent but nothing to get too excited about.While entertaining, the script is fairly inconsequential but that's not necessarily a drawback. The film's main strength is it's soundtrack, which prominently features about a dozen Beatles tunes, including the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"". Meanwhile, Richard Lester's tirelessly inventive visuals keep the action interesting throughout.In the end, the film offers a fascinating time capsule of the Beatles circa 1964. The fact that it contains excellent music and accomplished direction only makes it all the more palatable.",A Hard Day's Night
2303,63,Cosmoeticadotcom,Solid,5/10,21 June 2012,"It was many years ago that I first saw the Beatles' 1964 debut black and white film, A Hard Day's Night, on PBS. It had to have been during the 1980s, possibly during a pledge drive. Given that I was not a Beatles fan growing up, I didn't think much of the film, however, perhaps this was my bias, the wan rift of memory, plus the fact that I have become a much more acute critic of all things, including cinema, clouding my memory. Then, a couple of years ago I watched the band's second film Help! It, too, was not a good film. In fact, it was quite a bad film. However, most critics state that the second film was not as good as the first, and this includes Roger Ebert and virtually every other online critic for, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating in terms of favorability.Yet, the truth is, if Help! is, as I describe it, a 'bad' film, its 87 minute long predecessor is a flat out terrible film. That anyone would find this appallingly poorly executed, unfunny, hodgepodge of ill acted swill remotely entertaining is a testament to the depths human enjoyment can plunge. Yes, the songs from the bands' early era are good, but there isn't a single joke told in this film that garners even a mild teehee. That some critics suggest this film is equal to the great classic comedies of the Marx Brothers shows how addled some minds truly are. While it's true that, as Ebert suggests, this film had a profound influence on the music video industry that arose in the 1980s, it's had a negligible impact on film, itself. Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, and Ingmar Bergman, among others, were already far more visually sophisticated and daring than anything director Richard Lester tossed into this film, along with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. In fact, despite Ebert's claims that the film is 'strikingly original,' the very opposite is true- it is derivative to the core (think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, the Bowery Boys- need I continue?); so, unless one wants to claim that being almost wholly and shamelessly derivative is perversely a 'strikingly original' thing to be, Ebert's statement is doomed to go down as one of the greatest examples of his tendency to cinematically brain fart. The screenplay, by Alun Owen, is simply abominable. The film consists solely of songs with a few poor comic tidbits in between. These tidbits consist of the boys running away from female fans, engaging in pseudo-blue banter with Paul McCartney's supposed 'other' grandfather, a man who seemingly undermines and embarrasses the boys at every opportunity, and arguing over petty matters with their band manager. The film ends with the boys titillating a television studio full of screaming young females.Several things are apparent in this film: 1) it was designed merely as a moneymaking venture for, despite the brain dead criticism this film is utterly void of any real art, 2) the Beatles simply cannot act and their films, it seems, started their later slide into musical pretension, and 3) the Monkees'- television's Prefab 4 response to Beatlemania were almost infinitely better actors. In fact, their acting range was probably farther beyond the Beatles' than the Beatles' actual musical canon was above theirs, for the Monkees actually were good at improv; the Beatles weren't. And, the film is actually at its best during seeming improves. The clearly scripted moments, which seem less like even a first draft but a first premise, and which have the boys interacting with real actors is excruciatingly painful to watch and hear, as jokes that are decades old, even then, are told with a manic glee that somehow, if a teen heartthrob tells them they will magically regain their humor. One wonders why both of the band's first two films are so poorly made and the answer is rather obvious: producers rushed them through production for fear that the Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them passé before the films were released.The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test: if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so? Of course not. Furthermore, they would have used the films of many of the predecessor comedy teams I mentioned as proof of just how derivative this film is. However, this film's cardinal sin is not its pretension, but, aside from its poor technical quality, simply how dull and unfunny it is.",A Hard Day's Night

The movie captures their start-up and you can easily see why it caught on so well. These boys were handsome and talented and Everyone agreed with them and their music. Speaking of which we get to experience some of the best start-up songs of any professionals career and they still hold well to this day. Memories for those that grew up with this and for those that didn't, enjoy a decent song with words that make sense about the oldest subject in the world i.e. love.

2305,65,Beta_Gallinger,"The funny film debut of the Beatles, starring as themselves",8/10,28 November 2010,"Released in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania, this was the silver screen debut of the Beatles. This film was released 22 years before I was born, which means I was born sixteen years after the band broke up, and six years after the assassination of John Lennon, but I cannot remember a time in my life when I was completely unfamiliar with the music of the groundbreaking group. The first time I ever saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" might have been in the late 90's, and I watched it again for the first time in many years in 2007. I still thought this 1964 comedy was good when I finally saw it again after all those years, so I saw no reason why I wouldn't still be impressed nearly four years later. Without a doubt, it didn't wear thin with my latest viewing.The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr), from Liverpool, England, have a live TV performance scheduled to take place in London. The band members manage to escape from a crowd of crazed fans and board a train to take them from Liverpool to London. Paul brings his grandfather along for the trip, and the train ride does not turn out to be a very peaceful experience for the band members. Upon arrival in London, they inevitably come across more crazed fans to escape from. Their lives continue to be burdened by their stardom during their stay in the capital of the United Kingdom as they face problems, especially with Paul's grandfather. Even though he is constantly called a ""clean old man"" by the people who see him, it's hard to keep him out of trouble. The misadventures might eventually even threaten the band's upcoming performance, which is supposed to happen very soon! The opening sequence of this mockumentary features the hit Beatles song with the same title as the film, and shows the band members trying to get to the train while they are pursued by crazed fans. This is a great, energetic opening sequence with a fitting song to go with it. After this, the film shows the band on the train, and at this point, it's VERY funny, with lots of humorous dialogue, the people the band members meet on board, the presence of Paul's grandfather affecting the experience, etc. After the train ride, the laughs continue, but it eventually becomes clear that the film is not as great or consistently funny as it looks at first, and there are times when the camera work is shaky. Still, there are laughs throughout the film, with the dialogue and situations, even if they're not usually very big laughs. The band members all put on good comical performances as themselves, and the other cast performances are generally favourable as well, including Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's fictional grandfather. The Beatles songs featured in the film are a big part of it as well, and they also help.My latest viewing of this film was my first one since watching ""Spice World"" three years ago. That film was released over thirty years after this one, but certainly is a similar idea. Both movies feature a band playing themselves, experiencing fictional trouble as the time for a big upcoming live show which they are scheduled play in London draws nearer. However, I thought that the 90's film was very bad, and never before or since have I seen a movie which was that much like watching something in fast forward mode when I actually wasn't! I am not a Spice Girls fan, but even if I were, I highly doubt that would have made TOO much of a difference when I finally decided to watch their movie years after their heyday! Unlike that mess, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is funny, well-written, well-cast, and focused, not just slopped together like the later film that's often been compared to it. If you're a Beatles fan and want a laugh, but haven't seen this 1964 music comedy, there's probably a lot you could find to like here.",A Hard Day's Night
2306,66,johno-21,Beatlemania in black and white,10/10,7 March 2006,"What a fun movie. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release as a kid in 1964. (They gave us black and white Beatles Fan Club buttons.) Looking back through a 10 year old's eye's I couldn't wait to see The Beatles in a movie. I had seen them on TV and in magazines but an entire movie about them was going to be a watershed event in the career of the group. Indoctrinated by all the corny teen movies that mostly were made prior to Hard Day's Night you knew that if they were going to be portrayed as conventional teen idols it was going to be a bust but if it was a glimpse into what it was like being a Beatle and the London mod scene of '64 and The Beatles in their irreverent but likable persona with cool clothes and Beatle boots and lots of Beatle's music and The Beatles playing their guitars it was going to be a hit. Well it didn't disappoint. I didn't even expect there to be a story. I just wanted to see the Beatles on the big screen and hear their music. (The theater even had women playing nurses in nursing outfits and stretchers for people who fainted. Cool and campy. I have to give that theater credit for all they did. The first 50 people in got Beatles wigs.) As I grew older this film did not when I would see it on TV. Sure it was dated but it was still fun. Supporting, or in this case actual actors, Norman Rossington as Norm and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director along with Wiford Brambell as Paul's ""clean"" grandfather and John Junkin as Jake gave the movie a legitimate cast to cohesively hold it together and it worked well but heck, The Beatles were good on their own first time out. George Harrison's future wife, fashion model Pattie Boyd is one of the girls in the train car with the band (Her only line is ""prisonors"") and even future rock and pop star Phil Collins is in a scene as a teen fan. Director Richard Lester should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director. Alun Owen did get a nomination for Best Screenplay in the only film he ever did. George Martin also received an Academy Award nomination for Scoring of Music Adaptation. Any of The Beatles songs in this film should have been nominated for Best Original Song but they weren't. Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer for this film. He had just come off doing the cinematography for the film Dr. Strangelove. John Jympson who had just come off editing the film Zulu was the editor. This film does a wonderful job of capturing the era of mid 1960's London and Beatlemania on film in black and white. Their next film Help, also directed by Lester tried to be too James Bondish and although good was largely silly and didn't come close to HDN. This film has been with me so long and I've seen it so many times I can't help but give it a 10.",A Hard Day's Night
2307,67,khanbaliq2,"Working within a tight $500,000 budget, director Richard Lester turned out A Hard Day's Night in a fast 6 1/2 weeks.",10/10,9 February 2010,"A Hard Day's Night is a fine conglomeration of madcap clowning... with such a dazzling use of camera that it tickles the intellect and electrifies the nerves. Harassed by their manager and Paul McCartney's grandpa, the Beatles embark from Liverpool by train for a London TV show.The film is a comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with director Richard Lester trying every cinematic gag in the book, it led directly to all the kaleidoscopic Swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties - and to the prevailing tone of pop videos decades later. At the time it was a breath of fresh air, and its playful, low-budget style, shot in black-and-white and clearly influenced by the French New Wave, faithfully captured the group's irreverent attitude to their fame, the media, and even themselves. The film was successful both financially and critically; it was rated by Time magazine as one of the all-time great 100 films.",A Hard Day's Night
2308,68,The_Movie_Cat,A Hard Day's Sh**e,5/10,3 May 2001,"The Beatles have much to be praised for, genuinely breaking new musical ground in their careers. However, one thing that's often overlooked is how rubbish they could be, too. Aside from a momentary blip with the Help! Soundtrack they didn't produce a decent album until 1966's Revolver. While they had some halfway decent singles the first three years of their professional life delivered bland generic pap that sounded like a close cousin of Gerry and the Pacemakers. Their twee head-shaking antics are also cringingly embarrassing to watch now, and in all honesty only three songs in this film are actually any good.Ah yes, The Beatles films. Self-indulgent tripe the lot of 'em, from the plotless turgidity of Yellow Submarine to the Tragical Mystery Bore. Only George chucking his teddy out the pram in Let It Be produces any cinematic interest, so that while the superb Monkees film Head goes underrated, this pile of tat still gets criminally overpraised. To be fair, the direction is absolutely excellent, and the black and white photography looks superb. Yet while some of the one-liners are quite witty (Alun Owen's script certainly providing more mirth than the band's real-life Scouse banter) they are drained of anything approaching a laugh by the absolutely chronic acting. Shy George is predictably lame, though gregarious Ringo surprises by delivering a performance that can only be described as downright abysmal. John does little better, leaving it to Paul to be the one to hold any form of amateur thesping self-respect. The forced cheeky chappie dialogue and ""loveable scally"" characterisations soon begin to grate, and whoever told The Beatles they could act should be shot. The string of repetitive set pieces is fine for blinkered fans of the group, though casual listeners may become more easily distracted.Most irritating bit is John's line about Ringo: ""'Ey, 'e's reading the Queen. That's an in-joke, you know."" Oh really? Well if it's an in-joke then why include it? What it really cries out for is incidental music to paper over the embarrassing gaps between mistimed lines. Other than two instrumentals the entire action passes by in a ropily acted vacuum. Only player to preserve dignity is Wilfrid Bramwell, effortlessly eclipsing the others in this sorry affair. Other things to think about: People who resented The Beatles' later years when they got heavily into drugs like to imagine this period as an example of a wholesome band. Yet John does a coke joke with a bottle and Ringo admitted to being stoned when he filmed the canal scene. Also weird to hear George's original docker's accent in all its glory. A fictionalised 36 hours in the lives of The Beatles so fabricated their manager is a red-blooded hetero male. If this was a true reflection of the lives of the group then I'd feel sorry for them... for they must have had very boring lives indeed.",A Hard Day's Night
2309,69,ajs-10,60's fun with them Beatles...,6/10,29 April 2011,"I'll admit straight off that I am a fan of The Beatles, I love their music, particularly the later stuff, but some of the earlier stuff is pretty good too. This film was made when they were at the height of their fame in 1964. Beatlemania was sweeping the world and it seemed they could do no wrong. Personally, I was way too young to be aware of all this, but I think there's been enough written about it and there's enough footage kicking around from then to get the idea.The film focuses on the band and a period of 36 hours leading up to a live TV appearance. They are joined by Paul's grandfather, a 'mixer' as Paul calls him. Basically, he likes to wind everyone up so they end up having arguments. Of course he causes much mayhem, particularly for the band's manager, Norm, for the purposes of the film, and his assistant Shake. Throw into the mix a highly neurotic TV director and a collection of Beatles' hits from the time and you've got the makings of a film.Now, the acting is not of the highest quality from the band members, although Ringo does show a little promise. Of the other performers, Wilfrid Brambell did a great job as the evil old grandfather (very clean though). Norman Rossington was very harassed as Norm and John Junkin did a good job as the clueless Shake. For me, the best performance came from Victor Spinetti as the highly strung TV director, he was great. Of course, John was played by John Lennon, Paul by Paul McCartney, George by George Harrison and Ringo by Ringo Starr.As a film, I didn't find this very good, it's quite a mess with much chaos around everything the band do. I don't know, maybe it really was like that for them back then. The plot is pretty weak, but it does the job of showcasing the band and, more importantly, their songs, which were, for me, the highlight of the piece. I guess if you're a fan of The Beatles then you'll enjoy this immensely, and so, for you lot, recommended. If you're not a fan then I'd probably give it a miss, it's not a great piece of filmmaking.My Score: 6.4/10",A Hard Day's Night

The Beatles are also the best comedians cinema has ever put forth next to the likes of Charlie Chaplin and The Marx Brothers.everybody always talks about the music genius of the Fab Four but they are seldom given credit for their superior comic ability. they are masters of sly improvisation and visual humor. and even though they can be bratty and smart aleck, they have loads of endearing charm.this movie also co-stars the hilarious Wilfred Bramble as Paul's ""other"" grandfather. every time Bramble pulls one of his exasperating and annoying little shenanigans, everyone shrugs their shoulders and says, ""well at least he's clean"". pure hilarity ensues every time Bramble is on the screen.Richard lester really did revolutionize cinema at the time, and this is probably the best example of it. not to mention the music is wonderful.this is no mere rock n rolla film. this is cinema at it's finest and most enjoyable. just because it's cute and endearing doesn't mean it isn't a great work of art and filmmaking.i really like Lydon and the Sex Pistols, but when it comes to their opinion of The Fab Four, i say screw 'em if they can't lighten up and enjoy something fun (and brilliant) like this.",A Hard Day's Night

2312,72,Pedro_H,Solid gold record of the Liverpool miracles at the point of making pop history.,8/10,8 April 2004,"The Beatles travel down from Liverpool to record a TV show.If I was to meet Richard Lester I would shake his hand and thank him for recording the Beatles during the middle part of their career when they could entertain but hadn't yet shot off in to outer space. Without this we would have a piece missing from their history - and lets be frank - our history. They changed the world and all they had to change it with were electric guitars and their personalities!The script is clever in that it showcases the personalities of the group without asking them to do much acting. Wilfred Brambell tags along to give comedy relief and the whole thing fits in plenty of songs that are good - but not as good as what soon followed. They are still tied to the Northern dance halls.I have always thought that if they had a died in a car crash at this point they would be a mystery to the modern audience - hugely popular at the time - but not particularly stand-out from the other bands around. Like the way we regard Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford - both incredibly famous in their prime - but little regarded today. Whether you like to admit it or not there are three geniuses at work and Ringo Starr. So I guess that it is fitting that Ringo comes across the best of the group: Down-to-earth, chatty, witty and willing to talk to anyone. Even the kids down by the river. John Lennon had a comic wit that could have given him another career had his music not been up to scratch. Talk about being master of the witty comeback. Anyone watching this film will see London as it really was at the time. Not the swinging sixties that everyone pretends it was. Grubby shops, unpainted windows that look about to fall out of their frames, empty streets bar a few beat up cars. I guess you could say this is the perfect record of Beatlemania: The driving beat songs (cranked out even quicker on stage), the backstage sieges, the ping-pong put downs that is the hallmark of English humour, the screaming that overpowered the performance. Enjoyable at the time (as light entertainment) it becomes an important historical document now and every generation should see it. Your pop culture education depends on it.",A Hard Day's Night
2313,73,rebeljenn,"A great documentary, rich cinematography",7/10,29 December 2005,"'A Hard Day's Night' is an excellent Beatlemania documentary, showing an important piece of history in music. The film is not a traditional documentary, but it is a non-traditional documentary in the sense that it portrays the life of the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania. One of the most excellent aspects of the film is the excellent and artistic cinematography; director Richard Lester knew how to capture engaging moments to prevent this film from becoming dull and unengaging. The scene with the Beatles in the playing field (shot in one day from helicopter) is one of the most memorable scenes.The humour in the film is done well, and it captures the individual personalities of the Beatles and the problems that they had with the media interfering in their lives - which is an important and unavoidable part. The best acting in this film was done by Ringo. The film captures his loneliness and loss of feeling of unacceptance. The scene where he walks down by the river after taking photographs is touching and acted out very well; it is easy to feel sympathy.The music on 'A Hard Day's Night' album is also among the best that the Beatles performed, and there are several excellent film clips throughout the film that make this a historical music documentary.It's thoroughly an enjoyable film packed with humour, rich cinematography, and excellent music. The only downfall of the film is that it moves rather slowly in some places; the cinematography and the music help bring it back into focus, but the script is not as engaging and it would fail as a story on its own. It is a must-see for Beatles fans and music enthusiasts. This film should be shown in music history classes. It is an excellent insight into the successful career of the Beatles.",A Hard Day's Night

2315,75,barryrd,Another frenetic day in the life of the Beatles,8/10,27 September 2009,"This clever, fast-paced movie, made in 1964, came soon after the eruption of Beatlemania and brings to the screen the humour, the hijinks and sheer energy of the group. The music is singable and danceable and the ballads are great for listening. There is no let-up in the action which has no particular story but follows one frenetic day in the life of the early Beatles. There is great comedic talent in Wilfred Brimble, Paul McCartney's grandfather, an eccentric character who has great fun as he goes along for the ride. There are great close-up shots of Paul, John, George and Ringo. We somehow feel that the photographer has a soft side for Ringo, who can go from mournful frown to winning smile. We see the four trying to escape the mad crowds of fawning admirers as they go from train to car and from one stop to another. The action is spontaneous and seems to move seamlessly because of the great camera work.One of my attractions to this movie is that these are the Beatles I first remember but it also reminded me that they would go on to accomplish much more. This was before many of their classic albums, like Rubber Soul, Sergeant Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album. With each of these advances, there was more and more great music. John Lennon implied how the early period was just fluff and the real creativity came later on. My own view is that their music evolved over time. The early music is one great chapter with several others to follow in the relatively short span that the group was together.",A Hard Day's Night
2316,76,bigverybadtom,Amusing Low-Budget Movie,7/10,9 May 2021,"The Beatles essentially show off and mock their daily existences of running from screaming girl fans, having to make music and deal with their higher-ups, having to appear on television and not be able to go just anywhere without getting into trouble, and other such headaches of Beatlemania. The movie even incorporates a fictional ""dirty old man"" grandfather of John Lennon to add to the mess.There is not a lot else to the story, really, other than the Beatles occasionally playing some then-new songs for the audience. Recommended mainly for people interested in the Beatles.

2317,77,dave13-1,A must for Beatle fans.,8/10,23 April 2012,"It is very hard not to like this movie if you're a Beatle fan. Filled with the youthful exuberance of the Fab Four, it zips through a long working day of Beatlemania as the lads dodge screaming hordes of female fans while traveling to make a live TV appearance. It has all of the innocent fun that made the pre-Yoko Beatles the most popular group in music history. John, for instance, is a sardonic boyish wag with none of the acrimonious, world-weariness that characterized his appearances with the later Beatles. And Ringo is an innocent abroad who runs afoul of the law, setting up the movie's erstwhile story line of freeing him from the clutches of the police in time for the broadcast. Great, silly, charming and timeless fun.

We get to see the characters of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr and this movie seems to capture the UK in the sixties brilliantly.
In fact Ringo stands out as the great actor he could have become.
It is hard to think of any other music movie that conveyed the true atmosphere of this time and it is still a joy to watch.
Very few movies of this type have stood the test of time, but the Beatles impact on music is so beautifully captured in this classic movie.

2319,79,bbickley13-921-58664,A great music video by the Beatles.,8/10,14 March 2015,"Or rather, in a time when music videos didn't exist the Beatles make a feature film that does exactly what a music video was made to do.I'm not a huge Beatles fan but am familiar with the music the Fab four made when they went their separate ways, so it was interesting to see them together when they were babies.The movie was fun, playful and humorous, which makes them feel so down to earth (which I'm guessing is the point). their humor may have been all scripted but listening to John delivering puns, jokes and one-liners did the trick, and it was cool to see Ringo taking jabs at himself as the least talented Beatle.Even as one who grew up in the MTV generation, I was still impressed by the format of this movie. Watching the Beatles performing their songs was a treat and then there some music video like clips on certain songs that caught my eye. If you're not already into the Beatles I would give this a recommend, it can change your mind on them.",A Hard Day's Night
2320,80,avik-basu1889,"Look Out, Here They Come !!!",9/10,22 February 2016,"Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, 'A Hard Day's Night' is a comedy musical film starring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr playing themselves. The plot although is fictional, however the life of the 'fab four' depicted in this film couldn't have been too far away from the reality at the time which was the height of 'Beatlemania'.The concept of popular musicians starring in films is certainly not uncommon. But on most occasions, those outings turn out to be a shoddy attempt to make money by exploiting the popularity of the stars. This could have been a similar case considering the low budget assigned for the production of the film. But Alun Owen's great screenplay and specially Richard Lester's tour-de-force direction elevates the film from just being a showcase for The Beatles' music to levels of greatness.As far as I am concerned the basic theme of Owen's screenplay is the exuberance of youth and the yearning for freedom/liberty. Instead of making the 'fab four' play righteous heroes, the script makes them play themselves in order to make a social commentary in a subtle way. Like in real life, the Beatles in the film also exist in Britain at a very significant time when the old somewhat Victorian-esque ways of authority and customs were starting to be gradually obliterated by the youth of the 'swinging sixties'. This rift between the old and the new gets portrayed extensively in the film like the encounter between older posh gentleman and the beatles in the train compartment or the moment when an older man asks the gang to get off his private property after their wild craziness. The members of the band in the film are youngsters who want to do what they want to do without having to be answerable to anybody. Their manager almost gets driven mad by the lack of discipline of the group which is another metaphor for defying the restrictions and refusing to get dictated by the elders. The wild girls going crazy for the Beatles and trying to get close to them by escaping the police and the security is their way to become non-conformists by embracing the boys who represented their idea of self liberation. An interesting aspect of the film is the character of Paul's grandfather. Although based on his age, he belongs to the older generation, but he actually is a young naughty troublemaker in an old man's body. He represents the kind of character that the 'fab four' would be like in their old days if they don't change.For me, what makes this film a classic is Richard Lester's direction. He really adds the energy to the film. Some of the scenes have become very famous due to the directing techniques that were used to capture them. Lester's direction in the film is certainly heavily influenced by the style of the French New Wave. We see a whole array of intricate directorial tools like repeated jump cuts, Cinéma vérité style of cinematography in the street scenes to give a documentary feel, we see extended overhead shots, sequences with speeded up motion, etc. There are also some shots in the film where the characters wink at the camera a bit which is also a slight homage to the French New Wave. All these intricacies get put together and used brilliantly by Richard Lester to tell the story in a manner which goes with the themes and the nature of the characters. I think Lester's direction makes the film transcend genres. It has elements of a documentary, a musical, and a slapstick comedy all together. This must have to some extent influenced 'This is Spinal Tap'.Although John, Paul, George and Ringo are clearly not the best of actors but they certainly add the wild charm and likability that is needed. What can never be denied is that they are funny together. Paul making fun of Ringo's dancing or John having funny arguments with their manager or George's weird encounter with the fashion moguls are examples of scenes where the easy-going but effective comedy comes to the forefront. I have nothing to say about their music. It is absolutely fantastic, both the slower tracks as well as the faster ones, but one will expect that.Apart from the social commentary in the script and the uninhibited direction, I really want to drive home the fact that this film is bloody funny. I can watch it over and over again due to its vibrant energy and its easily likable comedy. This really is a Rock n' Roll Musical of the highest order and it does cinematic justice to the legacy of the Beatles instead of just exploiting their fame.",A Hard Day's Night
2321,81,mrb1980,Watch This Film...It's 1964 Again!,10/10,28 April 2008,"It's said that there's nothing like a song to remind you of a time in your life. This charming, funny, and frenetic film will take you back to 1964 and will let you relive the first, glorious, and innocent days of Beatlemania.It's important to remember that many critics in the entertainment business believed that the Beatles' popularity would be over by the end of 1964. The film was given a miserly budget and a very tight shooting schedule, and was seen by some as just another ""teen"" movie of the 1960s. The plot: two days on tour with the group, replete with screaming fans, electrifying music, and all the shenanigans of youth. Paul's grandfather (played with great style by Wilfrid Brambell) provides an amusing subplot, as the old guy is always getting into trouble.Great script by Alun Owen, along with wonderful, creative direction by Richard Lester, and the timeless music and charm of the Beatles themselves, make this film a true classic movie experience. My only problem when I first watched it in 1964? I was used to Midwestern voices and I had a very hard time figuring out what was being said!Excuse me, I'm going to do some 44-year time traveling now....",A Hard Day's Night
2322,82,Marc_Israel_365,A day in the lives of our projected youth!,7/10,12 March 2014,"Up until A Hard Days Night, musical pop star movies were a combination of schmaltz and rotating guests that were forced upon the director and audiences alike. Frankly, they are painful to watch, if only because they were so dated prior to release. While AHDN certainly has the usual movie schmaltz, it has three distinct elements that propelled it to our DVD history shelves. We were given silly editing of the song clips leading up to the TV show taping assuring eternal Beatle love for not taking themselves too seriously. We have the fab four delivering the quick witted, somewhat silly delivery of the schmaltz! We have live performance captured in that unique style that slammed Richard Lester as the grandfather of MTV. Each part has its' fingerprints on modern musics' video delivery There's no denying that the supporting cast are simply stooges, the dialog is forced and the delivery is about as natural as plastic, but we have our idealistic youth, real or not, captured in a time vault accompanied by a soundtrack that we all know by heart.

I revisited it tonight and I love this movie! It's got some very clever humor and nearly hits every joke dead on. I found myself laughing quite a bit and you probably will too if you sit down to watch ""A Hard Day's Night."" Paul, John, George and Ringo weren't actors and it certainly shows in this film but I think their sort of awkward performances add to the random humor quite a bit so I can't say they were bad actors. Being a huge fan of The Beatles, I automatically dug all of the music and was singing along. The story is weak but it has the right to be. And as I said earlier, the humor is brilliant. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I can't wait to watch it again. You should check it out too!

2324,84,dr_clarke_2,A music mockumentary years before This is Spinal Tap,8/10,13 March 2021,"A Hard Day's Night is director Richard Lester's 1964 film starring the Beatles, who play fictionalised versions of themselves as they prepare for a television concert. It is blatantly nothing other than a publicity exercise for the band (which isn't actually referred to as ""the Beatles"" at any point in the dialogue) but it turned out to be something of a classic and has been credited with inspiring generations of pop music videos.
A Hard Day's Night charts a fictionalised day and a half in the life of the band as they head to London and prepare for their television appearance and the cameras follow them around as they get up to various escapades in London. Things don't quite go to plan, mainly because of the antics of Paul's ""very clean"" grandfather (played by Wilfred ""Steptoe and Son"" Brambell) who tags along for the ride. The amiable plot sees the band members fleeing legions of screaming fans and meeting various often eccentric characters, and there's a distinct (if somewhat tame) anti-establishment vibe throughout the film, right from the moment the Beatles clash with the pompous Johnson in the train car. This is later punctured when the police who bring Ringo and Paul's grandfather to the station, decried by the latter as villains who will torture them, offer them cups of tea and are revealed to have only brought the old man to the station for his own safety; the film is thus full of knowing winks to the audience, lampooning the Beatles' public image, even as it profits from it.
This tongue-in-cheek approach is evident from the very beginning, as the four band members flee through the streets of Liverpool (although the scenes were actually filmed in London) from incoherently screaming, hysterical female fans. The Beatles hide in phone booths and behind newspapers and don false moustaches to avoid being recognised. A Hard Day's Night thus satirises Beatlemania at the time it was at its height. The film's message ultimately seems to be that the band members are four young men who want to enjoy themselves and are slightly baffled by quite how successful they've been. Thus, the film's climax sees Ringo, troubled by the advice of Paul's granddad, wandering London in search of a normal life, prompting his arrest and a madcap search for him by the other three. Appropriately, after this brief dalliance with normality, the four are reunited for their performance, playing on stage in front of more screaming fans, before being whisked away by helicopter to their next gig. The overall effect is of a ""mockumentary"" years before This is Spinal Tap.
And it's hugely entertaining. None of the Beatles can really act (Paul McCartney fares the best followed by - perhaps unexpectedly - Ringo Starr), but they do have charisma and Alun Owen's witty script helps to make them very likeable. The screenplay brims with whimsical and occasionally surreal humour, for example the bathroom scene, and Brambell gives a hilariously cheeky performance. He's joined by comic actor Norman Rossington plays their manager Norm, who forms a comic double act with John Junkin's road manager Shake, whilst Kenneth Haigh is hilarious as the obnoxious Simon Marshall and various celebrity guest stars send themselves up, including Lionel Blair, Derek Nimmo and Robin Ray.
The film secured the reputation of Richard Lester, whose talents are obvious from the frenetic opening scenes. Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor shot the film using hand-held cameras, which buzz around the four stars and create a dynamic energy. Aerial photography is used for the scene of the foursome capering outside whilst ""Can't Buy Me Love"" plays; it is easy to see why the film is cited as an influence on pop videos. The final concert performance by the Beatles, in which they play songs from the eponymous album, rewards those audience members who no doubt went to see the film at the time of its release because they wanted to see the band performing their music. The end result is a film that appeals to Beatles fans and film fans alike: Lester and the band would reunite for Help!, but it wouldn't quite match A Hard Day's Night, which remains a classic of its kind.",A Hard Day's Night
2325,85,bix171,An Important Work,10/10,14 October 2002,"Along with Michael Wadleigh's `Woodstock: Three Days Of Peace & Love' and Dennis Hopper's `Easy Rider', Richard Lester's `A Hard Day's Night' seem to personify the `right place at the right time' merging of film and music in the Sixties. `A Hard Day's Night' is probably the most important of these films, coming as it does with Beatlemania still swelling to uncharted heights and Lester capturing it in a verite style that lends an immediacy to what at the time could still be construed as merely a happy accident. Lester's innovation is assisted by Alun Owen's snappy screenplay (apart from some flights of fancy, it's remarkably realistic), the gracious charm of the Beatles themselves and John Jympson's tight, sophisticated editing. This film is the blueprint for the music video genre and is a spectacular piece of work that refuses to ever get tiresome.

2327,87,aramis-112-804880,Fun Little Movie,10/10,16 August 2013,"""A Hard Day's Night"" is a pseudo-documentary of a day (or two) in the life of the Beatles.John, Paul, George and Ringo play four Liverpudlian musicians named . . . well, John, Paul, George and Ringo. But even though they go by their own names and have ""The Beatles"" on their drum (the band's name is not referenced elsewhere in the movie) the story is a clever comedy fiction.Some things are obviously based directly on the Beatles' lives. The screaming teenage fans (what do those girls of 1964 think when they look back at themselves in later middle age?), the constant hustle from one concert venue to the next, etc. Luckily, the Beatles, collectively, had a cheeky sense of humor about it all, and a strangely natural way of presenting their fictionalized selves before the camera.Screenwriter Alun Owen (whatever it feels like, the movie was scripted) stereotyped the boys' real characters and gave them distinctive voices (despite their all talking in Scouce accents)retelling the Beatles' story as a surrealist comedy about four ordinary blokes who lucked out and are enjoying fame, despite the hardships (such as being unable to get anything to eat). From the script,(then)avant-garde director Richard Lester, working at a feverish pace to reach the studio deadline, produced a minor masterpiece that defies category. Is it a docu-drama? A ninety-minute music video? A musical comedy? To heighten the comedic side, Lester surrounds the boys with fictional players. The band's quarrelsome managing crew are portrayed by the familiar faces -- in Britain -- of Norman Rossington and John Junkin (the tall one).The plot, such as it is, concerns the band (again, ""The Beatles"" is never used in the dialogue) arriving to perform a televised concert burdened with Paul's mischievous, trouble-making grandfather (played with delicious maliciousness by William Brambell). Brambell's character is the catalyst for the band's difficulties, for instance when he provokes Ringo to go for a jaunt around town shortly before air time. Filming the movie in black and white heightens its sense of realism, while no doubt also lowering the stakes in the gamble of whether a real band could pay off in a movie.When it was first produced, ""A Hard Day's Night"" was probably seen by some of the audience, as well as the film makers, as a long promo to sell records. At the time, they also probably wondered whether the Beatles had any staying power. These days, the Beatles' first movie is a delightful romp best viewed outside the context of their contentious legacy. It's great fun.",A Hard Day's Night

Dialogues are cliched, unimpactful. Worst part is there is a significant lag after the dialogues. Character says a dialogue, and wait for the camera to cut away. Its just all over the film. What could've been a proper action flick turns out to be a boring time waste. Cinematography is just okay. What could've been better was the editing and direction. Nithin should perhaps script just the story and let his father carry on with dialogues and direction.One place he did succeed is with the emotional scenes.Yet, a film that marks the return of Suresh Gopi was hugely disappointing. Suresh should collaborate with talented makers.

A lot of characters were unnecessarily wasted. Cinematography was poor with closeups of characters filling up the entire screen. Music was bland. The movie is very much predictable and the first few scenes are enough to get a sense of the story ahead. The twist at the end was illogical. Suresh Gopi pulled off his character well and so does the newcomers. However i feel this movie, particularly its script and direction, does no justice to SG to be marked off as a great comeback. The director surely needs to take note of the movies and the art of movie making of this age.

2334,6,spnaircorp,"Zero Story, Screenplay Directorial Debut",1/10,28 November 2021,"There's ZERO story- screenplay- direction; in fact such movie creation will take Malayalam film industry to Dogs! Renji Panicker & Son's slum dialogues used mostly in ""painkili novels"" does make you feel pity for SG to have acted in this movie for no good reason.The entire story lacks common sense and audience left in the middle without completing the movie. I guess the story/ screenplay and dialogues were written in the 90's - since the movie was dragged to the core with a lot of characters shown unnecessarily, the worst anyone can predict the movie in the first 20mins doesn't require any brain. Cinematography, Background scores - Pathetic! Repeated music keeps playing when SG's closeups are shown- Horrible!Suresh Gopi pulled off his character well and so does the newcomers. However i feel this movie, particularly its script and direction, does no justice to SG to be marked off as a great comeback. The director does not belong to film making; should take up some other job; since the art of movie making of this age is clearly gone out of his way. Worst you spoiled the career of Padmaraj Ratheesh- worst screenplay, character and dialogues spoiled his performance!",Kaaval

2336,0,Leofwine_draca,Endearingly low-fi horror,6/10,30 April 2020,"I thought SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN was a hoot but then I write as a fan of low fi British productions of the 1980s, which always remind me of my childhood. I don't think a lack of money or a lack of technical skill impinges much on a good story, and this nasty-style film certainly has that. It's simple stuff indeed, with a school for troubled kids invaded by a mute girl with psychic powers and a penchant for murder. The tacky kill scenes are hilariously done and surprisingly bloody at times, particularly during the OTT massacre at the climax. The acting from the adults is even worse, although the kids are quite naturalistic. Some of the directorial choices certainly raise eyebrows but the religious-themed ending works a treat, and I found the whole thing rather endearing.",Suffer Little Children
2337,1,Woodyanders,"Come, devil, come!",8/10,28 May 2018,"Evil mute girl Elizabeth (a creepy portrayal by Nicola Diana) gets dumped by persons unknown at a children's home located in the British countryside. Elizabeth soon begins to terrorize the other residents of the place with her formidable demonic powers. Okay, so this micro-budget shot-on-video item was clearly shot by amateurs with more enthusiasm than ability, but fortunately director Alan Briggs does still manage to develop a genuinely eerie and unsettling atmosphere while also grounding the premise in a plausibly drab everyday reality. Moreover, the sluggish pacing and rather uneventful opening act is more than compensated for by a gloriously bonkers climax in which a bunch of kids go on a gruesome adult slaughtering rampage before none other than Jesus finally materializes to save the day (!). This film deserves extra praise for its take-no-prisoners attitude: Children are severely hurt, placed in all kinds of danger, bump off several grown ups, and a few kids are even killed themselves. A cool little fright flick.",Suffer Little Children
2338,2,BA_Harrison,It's the viewers that suffer.,2/10,25 June 2020,"A young girl is found on the doorstep of a children's home, a note explaining that her name is Elizabeth and that she is mute. The home's well-meaning carers, Maurice (Colin Chamberlain) and Jenny (Ginny Rose), invite the girl to stay, unaware that she possesses demonic powers.Ultra-low-budget shot-on-video horror Suffer Little Children was made to promote the dubious talents of the precocious tykes attending classes at Meg Shanks' New Malden drama school. Not content with flogging grainy VHS copies of their home movie to doting parents, Shanks somehow found a distributor (Films Galore) who neglected to submit the film to the BBFC; in doing so, Suffer Little Children became swept up in the whole 'video nasty' debacle, thereby ensuring a level of notoriety it doesn't really deserve. What it deserves is to be totally ignored.The movie's amateur pedigree is evident in every frame, from the title cards knocked up on a home computer, to the awful acting (actors regularly flub their lines), to the static camerawork, to the choppy editing and diabolical sound recording (music frequently drowns out the improvised dialogue). For the excruciating first hour of the film, nothing much of interest happens, leaving one wondering why the cover for the DVD boasts the label 'Strong Uncut Version'. All becomes clear, however, in the final fifteen minutes -- a crazy quarter-of-an-hour of violence that is just as technically inept as all that has gone before, but which clearly ruffled feathers thanks to the heady concoction of killer kids, buckets of blood, and the intervention of none other than Jesus Christ himself!This final act is certainly something 'special', as Elizabeth uses her powers to whip the other children into a Satanic frenzy of bloodlust, the youngsters grabbing kitchen implements and getting all stabby. The arrival of Jesus to vanquish the evil is truly a sight to behold, but it still isn't enough to make up for all the amateurish drivel that has gone before (in this case, Christ is NOT the Redeemer). Fans of z-grade garbage should give this bizarre '80s oddity a one-time watch just to tick it off their list, but everyone else would be wise to give it a miss.",Suffer Little Children
2339,3,BandSAboutMovies,A movie by and not for kids,5/10,20 January 2020,"A beyond low budget film made by a drama school and directed by the former owner of the Brixton Academy, Alan Briggs, this movie is strange beyond strange. Basically shot on VHS yet proclaiming that it's based on true events, it comes off as both amateur hour and endearingly earnest. It's a combination that more than pays off.Elizabeth shows up at a children's school with a note that says she'd be better off being there. That's because she's possessed - not to skate, but by Satan. Soon, zombies are rising from the dead and the other children are under her control.This sounds like so many movies that I love, like Cathy's Curse, but this movie makes it even better by having blaring heavy metal play every time Satan's powers are used and VHS static between each and every transition.It's the last fifteen minutes of the movie that make it great, with the evil kids decimating the adults until Jesus Christ himself shows up to take care of business, complete with video game drones, boops and beeps.No, I didn't believe it either.You have to love a movie that has its child actors writing about it on IMDB.According to Severin, ""Suffer, Little Children is a reconstruction of the events, which took place at 45 Kingston Road, New Malden, Surrey, England in August 1984. None of these events were reported in the press and now the house is scheduled for demolition in the immediate future.""You basically want this in your life right now.",Suffer Little Children
2340,4,Coventry,It's the audience that suffers,1/10,14 November 2010,"This is an intolerably cheap and amateurishly edited together independent horror flick that for some reason enjoys a cult-status that it absolutely doesn't deserve. I once saw a VHS copy of this movie being sold on eBay for more than £500.00! Damn, I pity the person who spent such a massive amount of money on this utterly worthless piece of junk! ""Suffer, Little Children"" is so bad that I can hardly find enough synonyms for awful to describe what's going on here. It's practically unwatchable, with lousy editing, incomprehensible narration, inaudible dialogs (also because the acting performances are so inept) and no sign of coherence or pace whatsoever. The story plays at a children's home where the caretakers suddenly and unannounced have to take custody of a nine-year-old mute girl with a macabre persona. The girl has the ability to inflict nightmarish imagery onto others and hypnotizes the rest of the kids. She subsequently enjoys forcing them to mutilate and even kill themselves in gruesome ways. Personally, I'm a huge sucker for (evil) kids in horror movies! Some of my favorite genre films revolve on murderous children, like ""Who Can Kill A Child"" and ""The Omen"" for example, but this one is hopeless and even infuriating. The premise shows such enormous potential, yet the elaboration is a total mess. There wasn't any money for make-up effects, so don't go around expecting gory killings or creepy kids' faces. Along with a handful of other amateur films that were made around the same era, like ""Goremet – Zombie Chef from Hell"" and ""Mad Mutilator"", ""Suffer Little Children"" is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. Do NOT watch it, please!",Suffer Little Children

2342,6,Stevieboy666,Bizarre amateur curiosity,5/10,18 November 2017,"On face value it would be easy to right this off as a pie of crap. And I wouldn't argue with those who think that. However it is essential to take on board that this was a very cheap shot on video movie using amateurs for a school project. Yes, the acting is bad. The music often drowns out the dialogue. The picture quality is poor at best. And the plot is just barmy (even Jesus gets in on the act!). But on the positive side the movie held my attention throughout, I wanted to know was going to happen next. Kind of a hypnotic effect. There's a fair smattering of gore, plus we get a few zombies thrown in for good measure. It's also a good glimpse of England back in 1983. A strange movie indeed, certainly not to your average horror fan's taste but for those who seek out strange films then it's worth a look.

2343,7,mwilson1976,A kids drama project gets swept up in a nations moral panic in an amateur production given a video release.,3/10,29 May 2020,"Purporting to be a reconstruction of real events that took place at the now derelict Sullivan Children's Home, this ultra-low budget affair was filmed by a drama school as part of a project using a home video camera, and was directed by the former owner of London concert venue the Brixton Academy. It somehow got a home video release in the U.K. and managed to get swept up in the Video Nasty moral panic of the early 1980's. When a mute girl turns up on the doorstep with a letter suggesting that she has been abandoned by her parents, it triggers a chain reaction of mysterious injuries and inexplicable outbursts of violence between the other children. With lots of uneven performances, limp staging, dodgy photography and a sound mix is that is rudimentary, bordering on non-existent (it's either music or dialogue, whenever it's both, the latter is completely obliterated), it's the very definition of amateur hour and is quite frankly awful. On the other hand, it has zombies (who sit down and join in a picnic), kids spitting blood, adults bloodily killed by kids and bloodily killing kids in self-defense, children chanting ""Come, Satan, come!"" like demented metal fans, and Jesus Christ turning up at the end to save the day, complete with his crown of thorns and firing laser beams.",Suffer Little Children
2344,8,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Not too bad for having no budget,5/10,14 January 2015,"Had this been done by professionals I doubt I would have given it more than 3. However it has been made by drama students with no budget and limited resources. The story is pretty basic. It takes place in an orphanage. One day a girl named Elizabeth knocks on the door with a written message in her hand. Elizabeth can't speak and is taken care of by the caretakers. Elizabeth seems rather harmless until she is gifted a necklace with a cross as present. This she uses rather effectively to get some of the kids under her control and ""accidents"" start to happen. There is a lot of rather boring dialogue but the build-up is good, the first accidents are rather tame but at almost the 1 hour mark things really start to get bad. Camera work was pretty effective. I was also impressed with the dream sequence where Elizabeth gets the first 2 kids under her demonic control. The ending well was pretty lame as if they ran out of ideas. The title of the movie is also the title of a song played in the movie at some point, rather catchy I must say.",Suffer Little Children
2345,9,juderussell-84094,Admirable But Slow No-Budget Horror,4/10,18 February 2020,"Look, this movie is bad. Really bad, but there's something very endearing about it that keeps me from calling it a total wash out. The concept itself of a young girl arriving at a children's home and causing all sorts of bloody and awful events is an interesting one, but the script just isn't there yet. Of course, I could sit here and complain about the camerawork all day long, but this was obviously shot on VHS for about three bucks, so it never had a chance. Even with the biggest budget and best lighting in the world, video is never going to look good.There's some ingenuity at play here and a few moments put a smile on my face, but even at 75 minutes, it seems a little long and padded - as if they just got their friends together and improvised the entire film in a weekend, leading to some endless scenes of rambling that are impossible to hear due to, I'm assuming, capturing the audio from the camera itself.I still can't bring myself to hate Suffer, Little Children. It has grit and a spunky determination that got me through some of the slower moments.",Suffer Little Children

I was only 11/12 years old and I thought I was so cool being in a film. We went to the Dorchester hotel to promote the film and then had all the problems in getting a certificate passed on it. I remember watching the film in a bar in New Malden and it actually looked liked my mouth never moved when I spoke my words. I played a girl at the home called Julie. I have only met one other person outside of my family who ever watched it and they actually liked it! I DO NOT OWN A COPY AND IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHERE I CAN GET HOLD OF ONE I WOULD BE GRATEFUL. The house has since been knocked down and new flats built on the site. I would love to know whatever happened to the other kids in it and also to Meg and Ginny.

2347,11,p-m-j-evans,you had to be a part of it to enjoy it !,5/10,1 January 2006,"As a teenager back in 1983 who wasn't actually in Meg's drama school but found friendship with the cast. I had a wonderful time being buried and used as a zombie in the nightmare scene - check out the only Zombie wearing a pair of creepers and dodgy socks. The film is low budget, cheap effects, less than scary but was fun to be a part of. If you like B rate movies and enjoy the simplicity of that era it's worth a look (if you can find a copy of it). The location of 45 Kingston Road, New Malden was in fact a run down building being used as a squat. It was quite a scary building on it's own but not because of the cast and crew. The building is no longer there and the site was re-developed a few years later. Of all the cast and crew - Meg's Daughter one Ginny Rose had actually been on TV before so I was told, I think in an episode of Dr. Who if memory serves. But fame found it's way to another involved in the production. Neil Longley, now better known as Neil Long on the Tolworth based Radio Station ""Radio Jackie""
