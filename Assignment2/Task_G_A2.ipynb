    "How would your recommendations differ if you ignored the similarity and feature sentiment scores and simply chose the 3 highest rated products from your entire dataset? Would these products meet the requirements of the user looking for recommendations? Why or why not? Justify your answer with analysis. Use the similarity and sentiment scores as well as overall ratings to answer this question. Here is a sample web implementation of a recommender system based on the same principles (runningshoe4you.com), but in this assignment, we will not have the time for this type of full automation."
